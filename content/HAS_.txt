coronavirus pandemic 

during fiscal 2020 the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on our business as well as our employees consumers customers partners licensees suppliers and manufacturers due both to the direct impact of the virus as well as the preventative measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus worldwide 

in fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021 we experienced 

◦ difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity shipping container and truck transportation shortages resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales these and other disruptions are expected to continue in 2022 

◦ disruptions in supply of products due to closures or reductions in operations at thirdparty manufacturing facilities across several geographies including but not limited to china vietnam india the united states and ireland 

◦ adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers resulting from retail store closures limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products 

◦ fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of ecommerce platforms in those markets 

◦ in fiscal 2020 limited production of liveaction scripted and unscripted entertainment content due to the hard stop and soft reopening of production studios 

◦ delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners 

◦ increases in entertainment production costs due to measures required to minimize covid19 risks and 

◦ challenges of working remotely including in the design and development of both physical and digital product offerings by us and our licensees 

in response to these challenges we developed and continue to develop and execute plans to mitigate the negative impact of covid19 to the business our responses included 

◦ utilizing our global supply chain and existing inventory to work to meet demand while managing freight cost increases across all markets as our manufacturing facilities returned to varying levels of operation 

◦ mitigating risk in the global supply chain by expanding shipping capacity activating alternate ports in china and the us and prioritizing supply based on inventory and customer needs including utilizing air freight to a greater degree which has raised our costs 

◦ accelerating our business online and expanding omnichannel to get products to customers and consumers 

◦ developing innovative ways to enable players to continue to play games remotely 

◦ continuing to create new entertainment including postproduction work and the development of animation productions remotely 

◦ implementing preventative measures and health and safety protocols and 

◦ introduction of a hybrid work model 

we have maintained sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources we also continue to closely monitor customer health and collectability of receivables the covid19 outbreak continues to be fluid and it is difficult to forecast the impact it could have on our future operations please see part i item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further information

• licensed consumer products  we promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products these include apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves we also outlicense our brands for uses in theme park attractions other forms of locationbased entertainment and within formats such as film and tv programming in cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a salesbased or usagebased royalty or a combination of both for use of the brands and in some cases the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees over the term of the license 

• digital gaming  we are investing to grow our digital gaming business to further unlock the value of our brands through play and storytelling this includes development of digital games internally and through third parties for example we have developed and launched digital versions of the magic the gathering card game including magic the gathering arena  which includes the games mobile application launch in 2021 additionally through wizards we launched dungeons  dragons dark alliance  a teambased action roleplaying game set in the dungeons  dragons world released in the first half of 2021 for pc and gaming consoles we also outlicense certain of our brands to other thirdparty digital game developers who transform hasbro brandbased characters and other intellectual properties into digital gaming experiences 

• entertainment  a key driver of the hasbro brand blueprint is to reinforce storylines associated with our brands through several entertainment mediums including television film digital content and other programming our entertainment business through eone is a global independent studio that specializes in the development acquisition production distribution and sales of entertainment content with our crossplatform capabilities our entertainment business leverages film and television production and sales digital content and childrens programming to create compelling entertainment and drive creativity across brands with merchandising and licensing tieins 

◦ television  in television we are a major independent producer of television content with a focus on the development production and acquisition of highquality television programming for sale to broadcasters and digital platforms globally through our television studios we develop and produce original programming for broadcast in our core television production territories of canada and the us which is then distributed into global markets to various broadcasters and cable networks by our international sales network we also distribute programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix and apple tv our television programming is typically financed on a production‑by‑production basis by way of production financing facilities our original television programming is sold to broadcasters on a series‑by‑series or individual show basis for broadcast on free television pay television subscription video‑on‑demand svod and other digital platforms our programming spans a variety of genres including scripted drama non‑scripted reality and documentaries and in multiple formats including series television films mini‑series and specials 

◦ film  in film our focus is on the development production and coproduction of films an increasing number of which are based on hasbro brands as well as the acquisition and development of film production rights and the exploitation of these rights on a multi‑territory basis across all media channels including cinema physical home entertainment and broadcast and digital 

in october 2017 we entered into an agreement with paramount pictures “paramount” to produce and distribute live action and animated films as well as television programming based on hasbro brands over a fiveyear period hasbro’s global eone studio plays an active role alongside paramount in content development and production under this relationship hasbro also plays a significant role in financing films created through this cooperative agreement under this relationship we plan to release transformers rise of the beasts  a feature length film expected in summer of 2023 in addition under a separate agreement entered with paramount where hasbro’s eone studio will serve as the production entity we plan to release a dungeons  dragons feature length film expected in early 2023 

◦ family brands animation  our family brands team develops produces and distributes animation content for children’s properties on a worldwide basis the principal brands include my little pony peppa pig and pj masks whose content entertains children worldwide and generates revenues around the hasbro brand blueprint through licensing and merchandising programs across multiple retail categories these brands generate revenues from advertising videoondemand “avod” through platforms such as youtube and svod revenues from the sale of content to video streaming platforms our portfolio of preschool brand driven content also includes pj masks cupcake  dino general services and ricky zoom as well as baby alive and playdoh

◦ music  music remains a key medium to increase brand affinity and awareness we create branded music working with distributors to exploit that music in physical digital and streaming formats we partner our brands with music artists to increase exposure for our products and we work closely with music publishers to collect music publishing income from all manner of exploitation 

• brand blueprint in action a few examples of our brand blueprint in action during 2021 and beyond are described below 

◦ in 2021 our gaming portfolio grew 19 to 21 billion our gaming portfolio is one of the biggest most profitable and fastest growing combinations of gaming brands across face to face tabletop and digital platforms in the world led by magic the gathering which had its best year ever we continue to invest in this growing business tabletop to digital magic the gathering and dungeons  dragons have generated significant growth with high engagement we have plans to leverage the power of wizards’ brands across the brand blueprint for both current fans and potential new fans as we have a new magic the gathering netflix series coming later in 2022 and in early 2023 the planned theatrical release of the dungeons  dragons feature film as described above we believe these efforts will harness the full potential of the brand blueprint with new products introduced in toy  game and licensed consumer products 

◦ we experienced a successful relaunch of one of our iconic brands my little pony led by the expertise of our eone entertainment team we released my little pony a new generation  an animated feature film that was 1 in the netflix kids top 10 in more than 80 countries on opening weekend this relaunch fueled greater than 100 growth in toy and game point of sale in the fourth quarter 2021 we have a significant multiyear content roadmap led by eone and a deep and innovative merchandise program which we believe will position this brand to reclaim its place as a leading global lifestyle brand 

◦ two other valuable brands that benefited from the brand blueprint were peppa pig and pj masks in august 2021 we launched the first hasbro toys and games for these leading preschool brands peppa pig was one of our top brand growers for 2021 and as we shifted licensed revenue to insourced revenue in toys and games we were still able to grow licensed consumer products revenue highlighting the powerful reach of peppa pig across categories 

brand portfolios 

we organize and market owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within our brand architecture under the following five brand portfolios 

• franchise brands 

• partner brands 

• hasbro gaming 

• emerging brands 

• tvfilmentertainment 





reportable segments 

segment realignment 

effective for the first quarter 2021 we realigned our reportable segment structure to correspond with the evolution of our company which includes the integration of our global independent studio eone the realigned segments represent changes to our reporting structure and reflect management’s allocation of decisionmaking responsibilities for evaluating the company’s performance 

our new reportable segments are 

◦ consumer products 

◦ wizards of the coast and digital gaming 

◦ entertainment 

◦ corporate and other 





• additional segment information  

◦ to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment to which the sale relates 

◦ certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

◦ for more financial and geographic information regarding our segments please see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements  of this form 10k 

working capital requirements seasonality 

our working capital needs are financed through available cash and cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under our revolving credit agreement in the event the company is not able to issue commercial paper we intend to utilize our available lines of credit 

in addition the company’s entertainment operating segment uses production financing to fund certain of its television and film productions which are typically arranged on an individual production basis by special purpose production subsidiaries 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines supply and product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers tv and film content releases including the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result a disproportionate volume of our net revenues from our consumer products business has historically been earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery we expect retailers will continue to follow this strategy in 2021 and 2020 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 62 and 65 of full year revenues respectively with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for approximately 31 of full year net revenues in 2021 and 33 and 32 of full year revenues in 2020 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable balances increase during the third and fourth quarters as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year however we have had sufficient liquidity and capital resources throughout 2021 and 2020 and have not had to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film television streaming and digital content releases which are often determined based on the timing of prime television seasons certain geographic release dates and competition in the market 

product development and royalties 

development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires ongoing development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments these costs include activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

development and related costs associated with wizards of the coast products are specifically allocated to that line of business including significant investments in tabletop gaming as well as digital gaming most notably for the development of magic the gathering arena  the freetoplay adaptation of the magic the gathering card game available online and for dungeons  dragons dark alliance  launched for console play during the first half of 2021 we also continue to invest in wizards of the coast tabletop and digital gaming initiatives planned for release in the coming years 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we work with a number of independent toy and game designers and compete for their designs and ideas with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired or licensed by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

royalties and participations 

we also produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media we compete with other toy and game manufacturers for these licensed rights and we refer to our products produced under these arrangements as partner brands licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories or may be nonexclusive in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon product mix and the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

our entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content such as producers writers directors and actors 

marketing and sales customer concentration and advertising 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific consumer experiences the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including massmarket retailers distributors wholesalers discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as ecommerce retailers and directtocustomer through hasbro pulse our fanbased ecommerce website our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence the majority of our product sales are to large chain stores distributors eretailers and wholesalers 

customer concentration 

during 2021 net revenues from our top five retail customers accounted for approximately 36 of our consolidated global net revenues including our largest customers walmart stores inc amazoncom and target corporation who represented 13 11 and 8 respectively of consolidated global net revenues net revenues from the company’s major customers are reported within the consumer products segment wizards of the coast  digital gaming segment and the entertainment segment in 2020 ecommerce sales represented a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to instore shopping due to the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the covid19 pandemic and we saw this trend continue throughout 2021 as compared to prepandemic levels please see part i item 1a risk factors of this form 10k for a further discussion of risks relating to customer concentration 

advertising 

we advertise many of our products extensively and brands through digital marketing and on television products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products 

as described earlier the hasbro brand blueprint strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums including television film digital gaming and live action experiences our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major networks globally theatrical releases as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and apple tv through our independent studio we are able to cultivate brandedcontent and activate and reignite our brands including brands from our vault the most recent example of this was the september 2021 release of the my little pony a new generation animated film produced by eone and launched on netflix globally 

many of our new toy and game products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we have historically showcased certain new products through international toy shows including new york city hong kong and nuremburg germany though with the pandemic our participation in these shows in 2021 was mostly virtual which is planned to continue in 2022 our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year for example brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch our wizards of the coast business will have substantial increases to advertising marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases 

producing marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs and the timing of a film’s release can cause our financial results to vary for instance marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and to a lesser extent other distribution windows and are expensed as incurred therefore we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical release and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window 

manufacturing and supply chain 

during 2021 the majority of our products were manufactured in thirdparty facilities in the far east primarily china vietnam and india using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes within the us and ireland we utilize two previously owned facilities now operated by cartamundi which are located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland to manufacture significant quantities of hasbro game products under a multiyear manufacturing agreement we have diversified our global sourcing mix and decreased our dependence on chinese manufacturing by increasing production of our products in other countries including vietnam and india as of december 26 2021 48 of thirdparty product manufacturing was sourced outside of china 

beginning in early 2020 with the onset of the covid19 pandemic and continuing throughout 2021 we experienced disruptions to supply of our products due to closures of thirdparty manufacturing facilities across several geographies primarily in early 2020 or reductions in manufacturing facility operations across multiple geographies throughout 2020 and 2021 additionally we have experienced difficulties in shipping and distributing certain products due to the ongoing global port capacity shipping container and truck transportation shortages these challenges have at times caused delays in the availability of products which in some instances have led to delayed sales and in certain isolated cases lost sales these and other disruptions are expected to continue into 2022 however despite these adverse manufacturing and supply chain conditions at this time we believe the manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and 

completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2022 for our products additionally during 2021 in response to global supply chain disruptions we have expanded shipping capacity activated alternate ports in china and the us and we have prioritized supply based on inventory and customer needs including the utilization of air freight when needed however if global supply chain challenges do not improve or worsen or we or our suppliers suffer prolonged manufacturing disruptions due to public health conditions such as the coronavirus manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as supply of components accessories and our products may be adversely impacted see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further information 

most of our toys and games are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also use electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the development design sale and marketing of toys and games and entertainment offerings operating in a highly competitive business environment we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as with many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers in certain instances we also compete with large retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices in addition we compete with digital gaming developers who focus primarily on digital gaming products we also compete with other companies that offer tv and film content and branded entertainment specific to children and their families given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers digital gaming providers and toy and game companies who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our branddriven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings competition is based primarily on meeting consumer preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films television programs and other entertainment content for example eone as an independent distributor and content producer competes with other major us and international studios that historically have released a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office and streaming revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels that can provide both inhouse distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime or streaming placement in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including content libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third party content any of which could harm our business additionally the discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the us competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games the variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children has expanded while product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other digital gaming products and screens and social media companies 

the changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content such as the growing number of streaming platform options continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsia” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsia empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsia and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsia and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsia the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules and regulations of the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

in addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children our business is subject to other regulations such as the general data protection regulation which became effective in the european union in may 2018 which restricts the collection use and retention of personal information as well as data protection laws in the united states and other countries failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities 

further we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

strategic risks related to our business 

our business will suffer if we are not successful in developing and expanding our owned and partner brands across our brand blueprint 

our strategy is to focus on fewer larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our owned and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential across our brand blueprint as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience this focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to acquire build invest in and develop our competencies in storytelling digital gaming consumer products and entertainment acquiring developing investing in and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money with no assurance of success the success of our brand blueprint strategy also requires significant alignment and integration among our business segments if we are unable to successfully develop maintain and expand our owned and key partner brands across our brand blueprint our business performance will suffer 

if we or our partners fail to successfully develop and deliver engaging storytelling through entertainment media our ability to build our brands and sell products will suffer 

engaging storytelling offered through entertainment media such as television films digital content and other media is an important way for consumers to experience our and our partners’ brands the success or lack of success of such entertainment media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with our and our partners’ planned media releases we also rely heavily on the efforts of third parties such as licensors film studios content producers and distribution channels with whom we work with respect to the development of content and timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts in some cases we do not fully control when or if any particular project will be greenlit developed or released our licensors media partners or other third parties may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or may decide to cancel development lack of control can make it difficult for us to get entertainment projects developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with such entertainment projects given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts any delay or cancellation of planned product development work releases or media support may decrease the number of products we sell which may harm our business in 2020 and continuing into parts of 2021 productions and entertainment releases were delayed due to the shutdown of productions and theaters during the covid19 pandemic delays and shutdowns such as those we have experienced can have and had an adverse effect on our results if films television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will decline 

consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products play patterns and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children families and audiences 

the interests of children families fans and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the everincreasing utilization of technology social media and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an everchanging and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles 

consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors such as critical reviews promotions the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and public tastes generally all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that television programs and films we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings that films we produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library 

if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic devices such as computers tablets and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products and digital games business compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies gaming digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are investing in designing and marketing products and digital games which incorporate more technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media there can be no assurance our brands products and digital games will successfully compete with other offerings or will achieve or sustain popularity 

our business will suffer if we are unable to grow our wizards of the coast and digital gaming business 

a key component to the success of our brand blueprint strategy is to continue to invest in digital gaming and technology particularly through our wizards of the coast and digital gaming business we have invested substantially in this business segment and as a result it has seen significant growth over the past several years and while primarily through growth in tabletop play continued digital game development is a key growth factor for the future if we are unable to continue to grow this business and ensure its integration with our other business segments our business may be harmed the digital gaming industry is highly competitive and costs associated with designing developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board and trading card games and action figures with no assurance of success the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment offerings and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing digital and technologically advanced or sophisticated products often relies on third parties and requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these digital gaming products could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of 

change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products if a digital game fails to gain consumer acceptance early in its life cycle there are limited opportunities to gain such acceptance through secondary launches or distribution through alternative platforms this pace of change or lack of consumer acceptance means that the window in which a digital gaming product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

if we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry including changes in entertainment delivery formats our business could be harmed 

the entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development including developments with respect to the formats through which films television programming and other episodic content are delivered to consumers with rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years for example consumers are increasingly accessing television film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks such as netflix amazon prime video hulu disney and apple tv to name a few similarly as a result of the covid19 pandemic some entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or at the same time as theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters direct release to streaming channels is likely to continue technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content especially those which are reliant on box office success we may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner the overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content including from merchandise sales derived from such content and the additional costs associated with changing markets media platforms and technologies is unpredictable if we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry our business may be harmed 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as licenses we have with the walt disney company and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or not pursuing certain new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

the play and entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the play and entertainment industry is highly competitive we compete in the us and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games products which combine analog and digital play digital gaming products and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices in addition we compete with companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories including through entertainment offerings across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and 

attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the play and entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

our entertainment business faces competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers 

the success of our brand blueprint strategy is dependent in part on our ability to produce and distribute entertainment offerings that consumers want to experience and that create further awareness of our brands and products our global independent studios operated by eone compete with major us and international studios that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues streaming revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies 

many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks cable channels and streaming services that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office or streaming revenues obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including content libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content any of which could harm our business 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business such as our acquisition of our global independent studio eone acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint such as entertainment and digital gaming offerings 

we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or grow our business in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future we cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

operational risks related to our business 

an inability to develop introduce and ship planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business 

the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

if we are unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges our business may be harmed 

in 2021 and continuing into 2022 we have faced global supply chain challenges with the production and delivery of some products being delayed due to logistics including labor trucking and container shortages port congestion and other shipping disruptions we have experienced increases in material costs and shortages for some of our products due in part to higher wages being paid due to labor shortages in china and vietnam as well as periodic and unpredictable manufacturing shutdowns due to covid19 while we have taken actions to lessen the impact of these supply chain challenges such as through the use of alternative ports and air freight such actions have resulted in higher costs and there can be no assurance that the actions taken will continue to be effective we have also increased prices in some cases to help offset increased costs we can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future and we cannot assure that price increases we have already taken will offset the entirety of additional costs we have incurred and may incur in the future to mitigate the supply chain disruption further if we are unable to negotiate favorable carrier agreements deliver products on time or otherwise satisfy demand for our products our business may be harmed 

if we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to ecommerce our business may be harmed 

our ecommerce business is accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers than it has historically in 2021 ecommerce sales represented a significant portion of overall sales to our key customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to through instore shopping due to the continued transition to ecommerce accelerated by the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the covid19 pandemic ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory which has caused us to adjust our supply chain additionally if our technology and systems used to support ecommerce order processing are not effective our ability to deliver products on time on a costeffective basis may be adversely affected failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business 

the concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 26 2021 walmart stores inc amazoncom and target corporation accounted for approximately 13 11 and 8 respectively of our consolidated net revenues due to our customer concentration if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns impose unexpected fees on us alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products our business may be harmed 

our customers do not make binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and 

reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore as we experienced with the bankruptcy of toys“r”us the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our substantial business sales and manufacturing operations outside the us subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products and entertainment offerings in numerous countries outside the us over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets such as eastern europe latin america africa and asia additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in the far east including china vietnam and india to produce most of our products these international operations including operations in emerging markets have unique consumer preferences and business climates present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

• currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations 

• the imposition of tariffs quotas border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures 

• potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business 

• political instability civil unrest and economic instability 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• implications or difficulties arising out of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

• complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement as such laws and policies relate to our products and approval of entertainment 

• difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the us 

• natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom 

• difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes labor shortages and other events causing transportation delays and interruptions 

• increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws and 

• changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally 

because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks 

our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products particularly in china vietnam and india presents risks to our business 

all our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are in china with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers in vietnam and a lesser amount from india should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including work stoppages slowdowns or strikes natural disasters adverse health conditions or pandemics our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a 

significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy and game manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers health conditions such as the coronavirus and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets including north america and europe further increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture could also have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the us natural disasters or health pandemics such as covid19 impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs border adjustment taxes trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the us or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the us or europe shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us delay the time of our sales to retailers result in lost sales and otherwise harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in china such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like vietnam india and mexico as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets including in the us we plan to continue those efforts in future years but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan furthermore many of these newer production facilities such as in vietnam and india raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in china that means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers newer and less experienced vendors are more susceptible to product quality logistics and other issues due in part to their less mature infrastructure or unfamiliarity with our product standards 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

our dependence on thirdparty relationships with studios content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content is critical to our entertainment operations 

we rely on third party relationships with studios content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content for example eone relies on third‑party content producers and distribution channels to sell and distribute films and television programs our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios content producers and distribution channels some of our content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate and some of our distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers these thirdparty content producers and distribution channels may decide or be required by their respective parent companies to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us our business may be harmed if the studios content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us 

we have entered into longterm output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all 

in some cases we have entered into longterm agreements to acquire films with producers these agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget in addition we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs as these contracts expire we may choose to renew renegotiate or terminate them these arrangements are also terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances if we are unable to renew or replace them on 

acceptable terms we may not be able to replace this content with other film acquisitions even if these contracts are renewed or replaced the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these longterm contracts may decrease there can also be no assurance that revenues based on these longterm contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs 

our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world in the entertainment and digital gaming industries experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense the increasing prevalence of remote work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely opens up more employment opportunities the impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships loss of creative talent lost productivity hiring and training costs all of which could result in lower profitability we cannot guarantee that we will recruit hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed 

we have experienced significant changes in our leadership due in part to the untimely passing of our former chief executive officer and chairman brian goldner in october of 2021 resulting in the recent appointment of chris cocks as our new chief executive officer and eric nyman as our new president and chief operating officer both becoming effective february 25 2022 our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives such as mr cocks and mr nyman in addition we have experienced the retirement and transition of certain other executives and changes in our employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets our loss of key management or other employees inability to drive success through our new leaders or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business could significantly harm our business 

if we fail to develop diverse top talent we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed 

to compete successfully we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people we promote a diverse and inclusive work environment to that end we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented diverse employees which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business competition for diverse talent is intense we cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business 

our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions 

our entertainment business is dependent in part upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs a strike by or a lockout of one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs which could harm our entertainment business 

our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the us and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the us and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products productions or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other cybersecurity breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems or thirdparty hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect they are often carried out by motivated wellresourced skilled and persistent actors including nation states organized crime groups “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers ransomware a denialofservice attack a malicious website the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our technology systems and data cyberattacks could also include supply chain attacks which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material 

global and economic risks relating to our business 

the global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections diseases or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers partners licensees suppliers and manufacturers operate could substantially harm our business 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations and any other variants or outbreaks of communicable infections diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we our employees consumers customers partners licensees licensors suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our business revenues and profitability the occurrence of these types of events can result and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in disruptions and damage to our business caused by a number of factors 

• difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity and labor shipping container and truck transportation shortages resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales these and other disruptions are expected to continue in 2022 

• disruptions in supply of products due to closures or reductions in operations at thirdparty manufacturing facilities across several geographies including but not limited to china vietnam india the united states and ireland 

• adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers resulting from retail store closures limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products 

• fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of ecommerce platforms in those markets 

• limited production of liveaction scripted and unscripted entertainment content due to the hard stop and soft reopening of production studios 

• delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners 

• increases in entertainment production costs due to measures required to minimize covid19 risks and 

• challenges of working remotely 

in response to these challenges we developed and continue to develop and execute plans to mitigate the negative impact of covid19 to the business our responses included 

• utilizing our global supply chain and existing inventory to work to meet demand while managing freight cost increases across all markets as our manufacturing facilities returned to varying levels of operation 

• mitigating risk in our global supply chain by expanding shipping capacity activating alternate ports in china and the us and prioritizing supply based on inventory and customer needs including utilizing air freight if necessary 

• accelerating our business online and expanding omnichannel to get products to customers and consumers 

• developing innovative ways to enable players to continue to play games remotely 

• continuing to create new entertainment including postproduction work and the development of animation productions remotely and 

• implementing preventative measures and health and safety protocols 

we have reopened our offices providing employees flexibility in their return to the office by working partially in the office and partially remote we have taken measures to safely bring additional workers back to the office including a return to fully remote work when variants emerge which increase infection rates significantly in areas where we do business the transition back from fully remote work to partial remote and partial in person may be difficult for some employees we are actively soliciting feedback and making modifications to provide our employees with a productive and safe environment and plan to continue to monitor employee efficiency satisfaction and morale as we continue to transition there can be no assurance that employees will not have some disruption in their work due to the transition changes in flexible working arrangements could impact employee retention employees’ productivity and morale strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks additionally the risk of cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks 

the impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain and while vaccines are being rolled out it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations if our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks we believe our business could be substantially harmed 

adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic conditions in the markets we our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business the occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages slowdowns and delays shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues 

inflation such as what consumers in the us and other economies are experiencing can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly 

reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices due to inflation or otherwise for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation and shipping costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

changes in us global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance 

our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate reductions in stimulus payments provided to consumers could impact discretionary spending recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the us and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

financial risks relating to our business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business 

sales of our toys games and other entertainment products are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over time as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs further ecommerce continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers as a result customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier this can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders further pressuring our supply chain 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance these risks have been exacerbated in 2021 and continuing into 2022 due to the global supply chain challenges we have faced due to logistics including labor trucking and container shortages port congestion and other shipping disruptions 

our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of television film streaming and digital content releases release dates are determined by several factors including the timing of holiday periods geographical release dates and competition in the market and more recently the timing of release dates has been affected by the pandemic 

this seasonal patterns of our business requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations 

as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster a terrorist attack economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays or other supply chain challenges that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

if we incurred any significant impairment charges our net earnings would be reduced 

declines in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge similarly declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings 

we may incur impairments if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition production marketing and distribution costs 

we incur significant costs to acquire produce and distribute entertainment content most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties the minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets and actual results may differ from those estimates if sales do not meet our original estimates we may 

• not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit 

• not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses 

• record accelerated amortization andor fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid or 

• not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired 

with respect to content we produce we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value in any given quarter if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results 

similarly our business could be harmed by greaterthanexpected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded an impairment loss of 741 million associated with our investment in the discovery family channel 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the us dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

our indebtedness may limit our availability of cash cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions  

we incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eone the increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular our increased indebtedness could 

• make it more difficult andor costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments 

• require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital capital expenditures development projects acquisitions or other strategic opportunities dividend payments share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 

• result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all including in order to refinance our other debt increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur 

• make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital make capital expenditures pay dividends pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes 

• result in higher interest expense which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest 

• require that materially adverse terms conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments which could include for example limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make investments any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions and 

• jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn 

if we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we may rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 10000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity we cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a 15000 million committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default we cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

if we are unable to obtain production financing on favorable terms or at all we may be unable to produce certain films and television programs or if we do so would have to produce them at higher cost and greater risk to us 

with the acquisition of eone we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions which eone has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms the use of third party financing also reduces the risk to us and reduces the demand on our cash and liquidity in the event that we are unable to provide eone with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable on reasonable commercial terms or at all we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production in this case we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we plan to do which could harm our business 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws such as those being considered by the current us administration and other jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

if we lose the canadian status of entertainment one canada ltd we could lose licenses incentives and tax credits 

through our acquisition of eone we indirectly acquired the economic interests in entertainment one canada ltd a canadian corporation “eocl” eocl is able to benefit from a number of licenses incentive programs and canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “canadian controlled” as defined in the investment canada act we have taken measures to ensure that eocl’s canadian status is maintained there can be no assurance however that we will be able to continue to maintain eocls canadian status the loss of eocl’s canadian status could harm our business including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to eocl 

governmental and legal risks relating to our business 

we are subject to various government regulations violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

we are subject to significant government regulations including in the us under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities advertising to children is subject 

to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world the collection of personally identifiable information from anyone including adults is under increasing regulation in many markets such as the general data protection regulation adopted by the european union and data protection laws in the united states and in a number of other counties while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future we could be subject to fines liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust employment customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

we may face increased costs in achieving our sustainability goals and any failure to achieve our goals could result in reputational damage 

we view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies we also believe the longterm viability and health of our own operations and our supply chain and the significant potential for environmental improvements are critical to our business success we have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in our business section of this form 10k 

we devote significant resources and expenditures to help achieve these goals it is possible that we will incur significant expense in trying to achieve these goals with no assurance that we will be successful additionally our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals or if we or others in our industry do not act or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to the production and packaging of our products 

our entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a distributor and producer of media content we may face potential liability for defamation invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed these types of claims have been brought sometimes successfully against producers and distributors of media content any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition 

we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights or claims by former employees for employment related matters because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations

the following table presents net revenues expressed in millions of dollars by brand portfolio for each year in the three years ended december 26 2021 



2021 versus 2020 

net revenues grew in all brand portfolios in 2021 compared to 2020 emerging brands growth of 29 tvfilmentertainment growth of 24 franchise brands growth of 22 partner brands growth of 8 and hasbro gaming growth of 4 with hasbros total gaming category up 19 

franchise brands the franchise brands portfolio net revenues increased 22 in 2021 compared to 2020 the majority of the 2021 increase was driven by higher net revenues from magic the gathering products as a result of successful card sets released throughout the year including multiple record setting releases and higher digital gaming net revenues from magic the gathering arena  to a lesser extent higher net revenues from nerf products most notably in the us higher net revenues from the my little pony brand due to the release of the film my little pony a new generation and the launch of the associated product line as well higher net revenues from transformers products supported by the release of the final chapter of the animated television series trilogy transformers war for cybertron in july 2021 contributed to the increase in addition to these increases were higher net revenues from playdoh products 

partner brands the partner brands portfolio net revenues increased 8 in 2021 compared to 2020 

within the partner brands portfolio there are a number of brands which are reliant on related entertainment including television and movie releases as such net revenues fluctuate from yeartoyear by brand depending on entertainment popularity release dates and the success of related product line offerings historically these entertainmentbased brands experience higher revenues during years in which major motion pictures are released 

net revenue increases from the companys products for marvel disney princess and star wars drove growth in the partner brands portfolio and to a lesser extent ghostbusters products contributed to net revenue growth during 2021 the companys products for marvel benefited from fan support primarily in the us across multiple properties including marvel legends as well as from entertainment releases including the theatrical release of spiderman no way home in december 2021 the launch of the preschool product line supporting the children’s animated television series spidey and his amazing friends  and by the introduction of products supported by the theatrical release of shangchi and the legend of the ten rings w hich premiered in september 2021 the companys products for disney princess and star wars benefited throughout 2021 from supporting entertainment including disneys raya and the last dragon which premiered in march 2021 the disney princess film library available for streaming on disney and the disney streaming series star wars the mandalorian season two 

these increases were partially offset by net revenue declines from disney frozen and trolls products in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of entertainment support in the prior year from the november 2019 theatrical release of disney’s frozen 2 and the trolls world tour film released in april 2020 

hasbro gaming the hasbro gaming portfolio net revenues increased 4 in 2021 compared to 2020 higher net revenues from dungeons  dragons products and digital game and to a lesser extent higher net revenues from duel masters products and several other hasbro gaming brands were partially offset by lower net revenues from jenga operation and certain other hasbro gaming products during 2020 due in part to the onset of the covid19 pandemic the hasbro gaming portfolio experienced accelerated growth in sales of games as families were playing more games while at home 

net revenues for hasbro’s total gaming category including the hasbro gaming portfolio as reported above and all other gaming revenue most notably magic the gathering and monopoly which are included in the franchise brands portfolio totaled 20989 million in 2021 up 19 from 17638 million in 2020 

emerging brands the emerging brands portfolio net revenues grew 29 in 2021 compared to 2020 net revenue increases were primarily driven by the companys launch of its first peppa pig and pj masks products during the second half of 2021 as well as demand for fanoriented products 

tvfilmentertainment during 2021 net revenues from the tvfilmentertainment portfolio grew 24 compared to 2020 in 2020 the shutdown of live action tv and film productions and theatrical releases beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on entertainment deliveries during the second half of 2020 and into 2021 however the companys production studios were back to operating at prepandemic levels across all businesses by mid2021 theatrical box office levels and related film distribution remained much lower than prepandemic levels throughout 2021 

the drivers of the net revenue increase during 2021 include higher scripted television production deliveries most notably from yellowjackets cruel summer and the rookie television series as well as contributions from the netflix streaming series graymail  premiering in 2022 in addition to these increases were higher deliveries from eones slate of unscripted programming as well as higher film production revenues from 2021 releases that include clifford the big red dog come from away and finch these increases were partially offset by lower 2021 film distribution revenues overall due to the gap in available entertainment deliveries as described above compared to 2020 which had a higher number of successful films which were released prepandemic 

2020 versus 2019 

net revenues from hasbro gaming emerging brands and tvfilmentertainment grew in 2020 compared to 2019 while net revenues from franchise brands and partner brands declined growth in tvfilmentertainment revenues during 2020 was primarily the result of the addition of eone entertainment net revenues to legacy hasbro entertainment net revenues following the companys acquisition of eone in 2020 

franchise brands the franchise brands portfolio net revenues decreased 5 in 2020 compared to 2019 declines in net revenues from transformers and my little pony products were the primary drivers of the overall decline in franchise brands net revenues while to a lesser extent nerf and playdoh products also contributed to segment net revenue declines much of the segment net revenue declines were due to reduced customer ordering supply chain delays and other disruptions to the business as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally in 2019 transformers products benefited from the december 2018 theatrical release of transformers bumblebee  driving lower revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 these declines were partially offset by net revenue increases from magic the gathering products due to favorable card set releases and to a lesser extent monopoly products during 2020 

partner brands the partner brands portfolio declined 12 in 2020 compared to 2019 

due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the entertainment industry during 2020 including the postponement of certain theatrical releases and other production delays during the year sales of certain of the companys partner brands products declined during 2020 compared to 2019 further in 2019 partner brands products benefited from a successful entertainment slate that included marvels theatrical release avengers end game and spiderman far from home as well as disney’s frozen 2 and star wars the rise of skywalker  released during 2019 

overall the decrease in partner brands net revenues during 2020 was largely driven by marvel products which are dependent on entertainment releases as described above and to a lesser extent disney frozen products also heavily reliant on supporting entertainment in addition to these net revenue declines were lower net revenues from beyblade products these decreases were partially offset by net revenue increases from star wars and trolls products which were supported by entertainment releases in 2020 despite the industry challenges described above to a lesser extent the partner brands portfolio benefited from the introduction of select items from the companys ghostbusters product line in 2020 ahead of the release of the ghostbusters afterlife film 

hasbro gaming the hasbro gaming portfolio net revenues increased 15 in 2020 compared to 2019 higher net revenues from dungeons  dragons products and higher net revenues from classic games including jenga operation and clue products were partially offset by lower net revenues from pie face and certain other hasbro gaming products

industry trends the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s toys and games and licensed consumer products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five retail customers accounted for approximately 36 of its consolidated net revenues in 2021 35 in 2020 and 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2019 the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2021 approximately 62 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers as well as growth in ecommerce result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues however in 2021 the companys inventory levels increased 40 compared to 2020 this increase is the result of ongoing global supply chain disruptions which began in late 2020 as economies slowly recovered from covid19 shutdowns while consumer demand began to outpace the capacity of the global supply chain infrastructure supply chain inefficiencies including overcrowding of cargo ports and shipping container and truck transportation shortages have led to higher costs for ocean air and over the road freight and delays in the availability of products as inventory remains in transit for extended periods of time these and other disruptions are expected to continue throughout 2022 

in addition to these inventory management challenges the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

unlike the companys retail sales patterns revenue patterns from the companys entertainment businesses fluctuate based on the timing and popularity of television film streaming and digital content releases release dates are determined by factors including the timing of holiday periods geographical release dates and competition in the market in addition entertainment business operating results fluctuate due to expenses recorded in relation to film and television productions and content such as program amortization costs and advertising expenses which are incurred and recognized beginning prior to initial releases and then continue throughout the related distribution windows 

inflation 

the impact of inflation on the companys business operations has been significant during 2021 compared to prior years however due to mitigating actions taken by the company such as modest price increases when deemed necessary the impact of general price inflation on our 2021 financial position and results of operations has not been significant the company continues to monitor the impact of inflation to its business operations on an ongoing basis and may need to adjust its prices further to mitigate the impacts of changes to the rate of inflation during 2022 or in future years however future volatility of general price inflation and the impact of inflation on costs and availability of materials costs for shipping and warehousing and other operational overhead could adversely affect the companys financial results

we experienced

◦ disruptions in supply of products due to closures or reductions in operations at thirdparty manufacturing facilities across several geographies including but not limited to china india the united states and ireland as well as increased costs and difficulties in shipping and distributing products 

◦ adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers resulting from retail store closures limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products 

◦ fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of ecommerce platforms in those markets 

◦ limited production of liveaction scripted and unscripted liveaction entertainment content due to the shutdown and gradual reopening of production studios 

◦ delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners and 

◦ challenges of working remotely 

in response to these challenges we developed and continue to develop and execute plans to mitigate the negative impact of covid19 to the business our responses included

• licensed consumer products  we promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products these include apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves we also outlicense our brands for uses in theme park attractions other forms of locationbased entertainment and within formats such as film and tv programming in cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a salesbased or usagebased royalty or a combination of both for use of the brands and in some cases the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees over the term of the license

in 2020 due to the pandemic the industry saw delays or postponements in releases of films or in some cases films were released direct to streaming or to streaming after a limited theater release we expect these trends could continue in the near future

working capital requirements seasonality 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions a disproportionate volume of our net revenues has historically been earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are necessarily indicative of future sales we expect retailers will continue to follow this strategy in 2020 and 2019 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 64 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for approximately 33 and 31 respectively of full year net revenues in both years 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable balances increase during the third and fourth quarters as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year however we have had sufficient liquidity and capital resources throughout 2020 and 2019 and have not had to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

tabl e of contents 

our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film television streaming and digital content releases which are often determined based on the timing of prime television seasons certain geographic release dates and competition in the market 

product development and royalties 

development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires ongoing development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments these costs include activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

development and related costs associated with wizards of the coast products are specifically allocated to that line of business including significant investments in digital gaming most notably for the development of magic the gathering arena the freetoplay online adaptation of the magic the gathering card game launched in 2019 and additional games to be released in the coming years 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we work with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired or licensed by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

royalties and participations 

we also produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media or whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers we refer to these products as partner brands licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories or may be nonexclusive in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

our entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content such as producers writers directors and actors with the acquisition of eone those royalties and participations have become more significant 

marketing and sales customer concentration and advertising 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific consumer experiences the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including chain stores distributors wholesalers discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as ecommerce retailers and directtocustomer through hasbro pulse our fanbased ecommerce website our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors eretailers and wholesalers 

customer concentration 

during 2020 net revenues from our top five retail customers accounted for approximately 35 of our consolidated global net revenues including our largest customers walmart stores inc amazoncom and target corporation who represented 15  10  and 8  respectively of consolidated global net revenues in 2020 ecommerce sales 

tabl e of contents 

represented a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to instore shopping due to the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the covid19 pandemic due to our supply chain and logistics investments in recent years we were better positioned to handle the increasing amount of ecommerce sales resulting from customers’ changing shopping patterns due to the covid19 pandemic in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from our top three customers please see part i item 1a risk factors of this form 10k for a further discussion of risks relating to customer concentration 

advertising 

we advertise many of our products extensively and brands through digital marketing and on television products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products 

as described earlier the hasbro brand blueprint strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums including television film digital gaming and live action experiences our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix in addition through the leadership of eone our brands are supported through animated and live action theatrical releases the creative talent at eone will help activate and reignite our brands including brands from our vault by leading the creation of brandedcontent the most current example of this is the my little pony animated film produced by the eone family brands team which is expected to be released in late 2021 

many of our new toy and game products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we have historically showcased certain new products through international toy shows including new york city hong kong and nuremburg germany the toy fairs we have attended in the past were either canceled or postponed for 2021 due to the pandemic our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year for example brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch our wizards of the coast business will have substantial increases to advertising marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases 

producing marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs and the timing of a film’s release can cause our financial results to vary for instance marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and to a lesser extent other distribution windows and are expensed as incurred therefore we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical release and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window 

manufacturing and supply chain 

during 2020 the majority of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china india and vietnam as well as in two of our previously owned facilities now operated by cartamundi which are located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement we are continuing our efforts to diversify our global sourcing mix and decrease our dependence on chinese manufacturing by increasing production of our products in other countries including india and vietnam as of december 27 2020 45 of thirdparty product manufacturing was sourced outside of china 

certain eone products such as products relating to peppa pig and pj masks are currently managed and distributed through thirdparty licensing agents beginning in second half 2021 we plan to insource production distribution and licensing of certain toy and game products associated with these acquired brands 

during the first part of 2020 we faced manufacturing challenges where operations were either shut down for a period of time due to the covid19 pandemic or were operating at limited capacity fortunately during that period our supply needs were at a lower point of the seasonality of our sales which are more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarter of the year at this time we believe the manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2021 for our products however if we or our suppliers suffer prolonged manufacturing disruptions due to public health conditions such as the coronavirus manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as supply of components accessories and our products may be adversely impacted see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further information 

tabl e of contents 

most of our toys and games are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also use electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the development design sale and marketing of toys and games and entertainment offerings operating in a highly competitive business environment we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as with many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer tv and film content and branded entertainment specific to children and their families given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers and toy and game companies who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our branddriven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films television programs and other entertainment content for example eone as an independent distributor and producer competes with other major us and international studios that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office and streaming revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels that can provide both inhouse distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime or streaming placement in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including content libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third party content any of which could harm our business additionally the discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the us competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games the variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other digital gaming products and screens and social media companies 

the changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content such as streaming continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings

climate change and its risks are issues we continue to monitor and manage in addition to initiatives to reduce our energy consumption and improve energy efficiency we support projects that increase the generation of renewable energy in the marketplace we continued to meet our renewable energy goal reaching virtually 100 percent 997 in our owned and operated facilities to address the greenhouse gases generated by electricity consumption hasbro purchases renewable energy certificates recs which support the production of renewable energy such as wind solar thermal and similar renewable sources at levels equal to what we use from the public grid these recs are bought in and applied to the markets where the energy is used by hasbro facilities across the globe 

we purchase carbon offsets to address the remaining ghg emissions generated by the use of gas and liquid fuel at our leased and owned facilities company vehicles all employee business air travel and the remaining small amount of emissions generated by electricity consumption at our facilities in markets where recs are not available 

we have also begun to evaluate the climate impacts of our supply chain in 2019 we began a comprehensive measurement of our supply chain footprint with virtually 100 of our suppliers participating our next step will be to set reduction goals for our suppliers hasbro is also currently evaluating the possibility of setting a net zero emissions goal and incorporating corresponding sciencebased targets

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsia” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsia empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsia and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsia and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsia the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules and regulations of the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

in addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children our business is subject to other regulations such as the general data protection regulation which became effective in the european union in may 2018 which restricts the collection use and retention of personal information failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities 

further we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters 

our canadian television and film operations benefit from certain funding and tax credits for certain productions in canada to continue to avail ourselves of these benefits we plan to comply with applicable regulations and directives of the investment canada act and the minister of canadian heritage

strategic risks related to our business 

if we are not successful in developing and expanding our owned and our partner brands across our brand blueprint our business will suffer 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our owned and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience this focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to acquire build and develop our competencies in storytelling digital gaming consumer products and entertainment acquiring developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money with no assurance of success if we are unable to successfully develop maintain and expand our owned and key partner brands continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands our business performance will suffer 

if we or our partners fail to successfully develop and deliver engaging storytelling through entertainment media our ability to build our brands and sell products will suffer 

engaging storytelling offered through entertainment media such as television films digital content and other media has become increasingly important as a way for consumers to experience our and our partners’ brands the success or lack of success of such entertainment media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with our and our partners’ planned media releases we also rely heavily on the efforts of third parties such as licensors film studios content producers and distribution channels with whom we work with respect to the development of content and timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts we do not fully control when or if any particular project will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors media partners or other third parties may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together lack of control can make it difficult for us to get entertainment projects developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with such entertainment projects given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts any delay or cancellation of planned product development work releases or media support may decrease the number of products we sell which may harm our business in 2020 productions and entertainment releases were delayed due to the shutdown of productions and theaters during the covid19 pandemic these delays and shutdowns had an adverse effect on our results during 2020 if films television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will decline 

consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children families and audiences 

the interests of children families and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the everincreasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an everchanging and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products and 

tabl e of contents 

entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result our products and entertainment offerings often have short consumer life cycles 

consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors such as critical reviews promotions the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and public tastes generally all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that television programs and films we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings that films we produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library 

if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic devices such as computers tablets and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products and digital games business compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies gaming digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are investing in designing and marketing products and digital games which incorporate more technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media there can be no assurance our brands products and digital games will successfully compete with other offerings or will achieve or sustain popularity 

we continue to invest in digital gaming and technology particularly through our wizards of the coast business costs associated with designing developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board and trading card games and action figures the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment offerings and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing digital and technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

if we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry including changes in entertainment delivery formats our business could be harmed 

the entertainment industry experiences frequent change driven by technological development including developments with respect to the formats through which films television programming other episodic content and recorded music are delivered to consumers with rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years for example consumers are increasingly accessing television film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks such as netflix amazon prime video hulu disney and apple tv similarly as a result of the covid19 pandemic entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content especially those which are reliant on box office success we may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner the overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content including from 

tabl e of contents 

merchandise sales derived from such content and the additional costs associated with changing markets media platforms and technologies is unpredictable if we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry our business may be harmed 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars disney frozen beyblade disney princess and sesame street and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

the play and entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the play and entertainment industry is highly competitive we compete in the us and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games products which combine analog and digital play digital gaming products and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices in addition we compete with companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories including through entertainment offerings across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the play and entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

our entertainment business faces competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers 

the success of our brand blueprint strategy is dependent in part on our ability to produce and distribute entertainment offerings that consumers want to experience and that create further awareness of our brands and products our independent studios now operated by eone compete with major us and international studios that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues streaming revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies 

many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than 

tabl e of contents 

we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including content libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content any of which could harm our business 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business such as our recent acquisition of eone acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint such as our acquisition of eone which added proven television and film capabilities 

we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or grow our business in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future we cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

operational risks related to our business 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner or our inability to adapt to ecommerce may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business 

further ecommerce and omnichannel business is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

the concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 27 2020 walmart stores inc amazoncom and target corporation and accounted for approximately 15  10  and 8  respectively of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers in 2020 ecommerce sales represented a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to through instore shopping due to the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the covid19 pandemic ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory 

tabl e of contents 

which has caused us to adjust our supply chain failure to continue to adapt our supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business 

due to our customer concentration if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns impose unexpected fees on us alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products our business may be harmed 

our customers do not make binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore as we experienced with the bankruptcy of toys“r”us the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our substantial business sales and manufacturing operations outside the us subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the us over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets such as eastern europe latin america africa and asia additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in the far east including china india and vietnam to produce most of our products these international operations including operations in emerging markets have unique consumer preferences and business climates present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

• currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations 

• the imposition of tariffs quotas border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures 

• potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business 

• political instability civil unrest and economic instability 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• implications or difficulties arising out of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

• complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement 

• difficulties understanding the retail climate consumer trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the us 

• natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom 

• difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another including port congestion strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions 

• increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws and 

• changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally 

because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks

our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products particularly in china india and vietnam presents risks to our business 

all of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers in india and vietnam should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including work stoppages slowdowns or strikes natural disasters adverse health conditions or pandemics our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers health conditions such as the coronavirus and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets including north america and europe further increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture could also have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the us natural disasters or health pandemics such as covid19 impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs border adjustment taxes trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the us or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the us or europe shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us delay the time of our sales to retailers result in lost sales and otherwise harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in china such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like india vietnam and mexico as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets including in the us we plan to continue those efforts in future years but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan furthermore many of these newer production facilities such as in india and vietnam raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in china that means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

our dependence on thirdparty relationships with studios content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content is critical to our entertainment operations 

we rely on third party relationships with studios content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content for example eone relies on third‑party content producers and distribution channels to sell and distribute films and television programs our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios content producers and distribution channels some of our content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate and some of our distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers these thirdparty content producers and distribution channels may decide or be required by their respective parent companies to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us our business may be harmed if the studios content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us 

tabl e of contents 

we have entered into longterm output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all 

we have entered into longterm agreements to acquire films with producers these agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget in addition we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs as these contracts expire we may choose to renew renegotiate or terminate them these arrangements are also terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances if we are unable to renew or replace them on acceptable terms we may not be able to replace this content with other film acquisitions even if these contracts are renewed or replaced the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these longterm contracts may decrease there can also be no assurance that revenues based on these longterm contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs 

our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world in the entertainment industry experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense the impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships loss of creative talent lost productivity hiring and training costs all of which could result in lower profitability we cannot guarantee that we will recruit hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed 

we have experienced significant changes in our workforce due in part to our acquisition of eone restructuring efforts recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our evolving global business and retirement of certain executives the changes in our employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets have required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

if we fail to develop diverse top talent we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed 

to compete successfully we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people we promote a diverse and inclusive work environment to that end we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented diverse employees which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business competition for diverse talent is intense we cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business 

our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions 

our entertainment business is dependent in part upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs a strike by or a lockout of one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs which could harm our entertainment business 

our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the us and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the us and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products productions or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other cybersecurity breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems or thirdparty hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material 

global and economic risks relating to our business 

the global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections diseases or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers partners licensees suppliers and manufacturers operate could substantially harm our business 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations and any other outbreaks of communicable infections diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we our employees consumers customers partners licensees licensors suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our business revenues and profitability the occurrence of these types of events can result and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in disruptions and damage to our business caused by a number of factors 

• the negative impact to our ability to design develop manufacture and ship product as well as produce and distribute entertainment content 

• delays in entertainment content releases from our partners and licensors or changes in release plans that can adversely impact our product sales examples of releases that have been delayed include disney’s mulan  marvel’s black widow sony pictures ghostbusters afterlife and snake eyes gi joe origins  

• the negative impact on consumer purchasing behavior and availability of product to consumers including due to retail store closures limited reopenings shelter at home instructions and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce 

• disruptions or restrictions on the ability of some of our employees suppliers and manufacturers to work effectively including due to illness quarantines government actions and facility closures or other similar restrictions 

tabl e of contents 

• temporary or permanent closures of limited reopenings or other restrictions on businesses such as retail stores in which our products andor the products of our licensees are sold as well as studios and theaters in which or for which we produce and distribute entertainment content and 

• other negative effects of the coronavirus on our business including increased risks of accounts receivable collection bankruptcies of retailers delays in payment and negotiations with customers or licensees over payment terms or the ability to perform under contracts or licenses 

during 2020 due to the coronavirus we experienced and could experience further disruptions in supply of product which has been and can be driven by manufacturing and other work stoppages factory and other business closings slowdowns or delays in places where a substantial portion of our manufacturing occurs restrictions and limitations placed on workers and factories including quarantines and other limitations on the ability to travel and return to work and shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials even as facilities reopen or workers return to work such reopenings and returns have been and we expect will continue to be measured and gradual for some period of time so as to minimize the risk of further outbreaks of the virus and that despite precautions further outbreaks may occur and result in future negative impacts 

certain aspects of our entertainment business have continued without significant disruption such as development and preproduction work in our animation business other aspects of our entertainment business were significantly negatively impacted by the coronavirus specifically scheduled liveaction productions were delayed or postponed during much of 2020 due to the shutdown of production work and the closure or limited reopening of studios theatrical releases have been delayed due to the closure or limited reopening of theaters and in some cases global releases moved to different media platforms such as streaming services although productions have been reopening on a limited basis depending on the future impact of the coronavirus our entertainment business may continue to be adversely affected in the future 

the negative impact to demand can be caused by delays in or reduced purchases from customers and consumers who may be reluctant or unable to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner due to restrictions on or closure either temporarily or permanently of many retail stores and hobby stores in which our products are sold demand has been and may be further impacted due to consumers’ lower discretionary income due to reduced or limited work or unemployment which has increased dramatically due to the coronavirus 

due the nature of our global business we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of ecommerce platforms in those markets for example we experienced substantial business difficulties in certain countries in latin america which have continued to be adversely affected by the number of coronavirus cases resulting in substantial retail disruption and which have not historically had large ecommerce businesses further countries that may currently be controlling the virus may suffer setbacks as markets businesses schools and communities reopen thereby causing further restrictions or closures of retail stores studios and production work all of which could adversely impact our business 

since midmarch 2020 most of our workforce has been working remotely reopening of our offices has begun on a limited basis and we continue to actively work on a plan to safely bring additional workers back to the office while most of our workforce has been able to work remotely in an effective manner certain employees whose job responsibilities require in person work such as those whose job it is to go into retail stores or are involved in design or production work have seen reduced productivity and in some cases have been furloughed or terminated we regularly communicate and engage with our employees to minimize the disruption and stress of working remotely provide flexibility and ensure that our employees are getting access to information and accommodations as we continue to plan for a successful and safe reentry to the workplace 

we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available at this time during this time of uncertainty however we are managing our expenses to further preserve our liquidity and we are closely monitoring our customers’ health and collectability of receivables with some customers having difficulty making payments or requesting extended payment terms at a time when retailers are experiencing challenges and some have filed for bankruptcy 

the impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain and while vaccines are being rolled out it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations if our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks we believe our business could be substantially harmed 

tabl e of contents 

changes in us global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance 

our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the us and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products or incur expenses to develop and produce entertainment offerings with no assurance of success those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

other adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic conditions in the markets we our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business the occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages slowdowns and delays shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

financial risks relating to our business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business 

sales of our toys games and other entertainment products are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs further ecommerce continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers as a result customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier this can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders further pressuring our supply chain as we experienced in 2019 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand 

tabl e of contents 

additionally the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations 

our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of television film streaming and digital content releases release dates are determined by several factors including the timing of holiday periods geographical release dates and competition in the market 

as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster a terrorist attack economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

if we incurred any significant impairment charges our net earnings would be reduced 

declines in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge similarly declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations 

we may incur impairments if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition production marketing and distribution costs 

we incur significant costs to acquire produce and distribute entertainment content most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties the minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets and actual results may differ from those estimates if sales do not meet our original estimates we may 

• not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit 

• not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses 

• record accelerated amortization andor fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid or 

• not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired 

with respect to content we produce we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value in any given quarter if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the us dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control depreciation in key

currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

our indebtedness may limit our availability of cash cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or may it more difficult to take certain other actions  

we incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eone the increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular our increased indebtedness could 

• make it more difficult andor costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments 

• require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital capital expenditures development projects acquisitions or other strategic opportunities dividend payments share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 

• result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all including in order to refinance our other debt increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur 

• make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital make capital expenditures pay dividends pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes 

• result in higher interest expense which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest 

• require that materially adverse terms conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments which could include for example limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make investments any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions and 

• jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn 

if we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we may rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 10000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity we cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a 15000 million committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the 

tabl e of contents 

financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default we cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

if we are unable to obtain production financing on favorable terms or at all we may be unable to produce certain films and television programs or if we do so would have to produce them at higher cost and greater risk to us 

with the acquisition of eone we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions which eone has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms the use of third party financing also reduces the risk to us and reduces the demand on our cash and liquidity in the event that we are unable to provide eone with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable on reasonable commercial terms or at all we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production in this case we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we plan to do which could harm our business 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

if we lose the canadian status of entertainment one canada ltd we could lose licenses incentives and tax credits 

through our acquisition of eone we indirectly acquired the economic interests in entertainment one canada ltd a canadian corporation “eocl” eocl is able to benefit from a number of licenses incentive programs and canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “canadian controlled” as defined in the investment canada act we have taken measures to ensure that eocl’s canadian status is maintained there can be no assurance however that we will be able to continue to maintain eocls canadian status the loss of eocl’s canadian status could harm our business including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to eocl

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust employment customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition

2020 versus 2019 

hasbro gaming and emerging brands net revenues grew in 2020 compared to 2019 while net revenues from franchise brands and partner brands declined tv film and entertainment consists of the legacy eone film and tv revenues 

franchise brands the franchise brands portfolio decreased 5 in 2020 compared to 2019 declines in net revenues from transformers and my little pony products were the primary drivers of the overall decline in franchise brands net revenues while to a lesser extent nerf and playdoh products also contributed to segment net revenue declines much of the segment net revenue declines were due to reduced customer ordering supply chain delays and other disruptions to the business as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally in 2019 transformers products benefited from the december 2018 theatrical release of transformers bumblebee  driving lower revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 these declines were partially offset by net revenue increases from magic the gathering products due to favorable card set releases and to a lesser extent monopoly products during 2020 

partner brands the partner brands portfolio declined 12 in 2020 compared to 2019 

within the partner brands portfolio there are a number of brands which are reliant on related entertainment including television and movie releases as such net revenues by partner brand fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on entertainment popularity release dates and related product line offerings and success historically these entertainmentbased brands experience higher revenues during years in which major motion pictures are released 

due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the entertainment industry during 2020 including the postponement of certain theatrical releases such as marvels black widow  previously planned as a 2020 marvel release as well as other production delays during the year sales of certain of the companys partner brands products declined during 2020 compared to 2019 further in 2019 partner brands products benefited from a successful entertainment slate that included marvels second quarter 2019 theatrical release avengers end game and the third quarter 2019 theatrical release spiderman far from home as well as disney’s frozen 2 and star wars the rise of skywalker  released during the fourth quarter of 2019

videoondemand format in april and the disney streaming series star wars the mandalorian  season two released during the fourth quarter of 2020 

overall the decrease in partner brands net revenues during 2020 was largely driven by marvel products which are dependent on entertainment releases as described above and to a lesser extent disney frozen products also heavily reliant on supporting entertainment in addition to these net revenue declines were lower net revenues from beyblade products these decreases were partially offset by net revenue increases from star wars and trolls products which were supported by the entertainment releases described above to a lesser extent the partner brands portfolio benefited from the introduction of select items from the companys ghostbusters product line in 2020 ahead of the release of the ghostbusters afterlife film previously planned as a 2020 release but postponed and expected in theaters during 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic 

hasbro gaming the hasbro gaming portfolio increased 15 in 2020 compared to 2019 higher net revenues from dungeons  dragons products and higher net revenues from classic games including jenga operation and clue products were partially offset by lower net revenues from pie face and certain other hasbro gaming products

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted in a modification to the company’s longterm plan for its backflip business these modifications included organizational actions and related personnel changes the extension of launch dates for games currently in or planned for development and the addition of partners for the development of future game releases the modifications resulted in changes to the longterm projections for the backflip business which led the company to conclude the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 19 was utilized representing the reporting unit’s estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the impairment test the company determined that the carrying value of the backflip reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the company recorded an impairment charge of 863 million within administrative expense and in the company’s entertainment licensing and digital segment during the fourth quarter of 2018 which was the full amount of remaining goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit subsequently during 2019 the company made the decision to close the backflip business 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 

during 2020 the company determined that certain of its definitelived intangible entertainment and production assets related to properties from both the legacy hasbro business as well as properties acquired through the eone acquisition were impaired it was determined that the carrying values of these intangible assets exceeded their related future cash flows thus indicating impairment as a result charges of 201 and 307 million were recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively within acquisition and related costs in the companys consolidated statement of operations included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this form 10k 

there were no other triggering events in 2020 or 2019 which would indicate the companys intangible assets were impaired

business combinations 

the company accounts for business combination under fasb accounting standards codification topic 805 business combinations “topic 805” identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree exceed the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

the companys evaluation of the facts and circumstances available as of december 30 2019 to assign fair values to eone assets acquired and liabilities assumed including income tax related amounts continued throughout 2020 as further analysis of assets including program rights investment in films and television content intangible assets as well as deferred revenue noncontrolling interests tax and certain other liabilities was completed during the year additional information on the assets acquired and liabilities assumed became available changes in the information related to the net assets acquired changed the amount of the purchase price assigned to goodwill and as a result the preliminary fair values disclosed were adjusted as additional information was obtained and valuations were finalized provisional adjustments if any were recognized during the reporting periods in which the adjustments were determined for more information on the eone acquisition see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this form 10k 

valuation of equity method investment in discovery family channel 

the company owns an interest in a joint venture discovery family channel “the network” with discovery communications inc “discovery” the company has determined that it does not meet the control requirements to consolidate the network and accounts for the investment using the equity method of accounting the network was established to create a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment in october 2009 the company purchased an initial 50 share in the network for a payment of 300 million and certain future tax payments based on the value of certain tax benefits expected to be received by the company in september 2014 the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to the network and discovery increased its equity interest in the network to 60 while the company retained a 40 equity interest in the network in connection with the amendment the company and discovery entered into an option agreement related to the company’s remaining 40 ownership in the network exercisable during the oneyear period following december 31 2021 the exercise price of the option agreement is based upon 80 of the then fair market value of the network subject to a fair market value floor 

the company tests its equity method investment in the network for impairment annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company’s valuation of its equity method investment in the network includes assumptions surrounding forecasted revenue and expenses a discount rate and a terminal growth rate which are used to estimate the fair value of the investment and involve a high degree of subjectivity given the volatility in consumer interest when choosing entertainment media

a as discussed above the tax act requires the company to pay a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings of 3080 million the company utilized 785 million of existing tax credits to reduce the 3080 million us federal income tax liability which resulted in 2295 million to be paid in interestfree installments through 2025 of which 551 million was paid through 2020 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements of this form 10k for further discussion 

b in connection with the company’s agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above 

c purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business as well as purchase commitments under a manufacturing agreement the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 27 2020

other expected future payments 

from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments as such these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below 

• included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 27 2020 the company has a liability of 606 million of potential tax interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate 

tabl e of contents 

resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate amount or timing of payments related to this liability 

• at december 27 2020 the company had letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 162 million 

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts at december 27 2020 the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 407 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 27 2020 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 79 million of which 37 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 11 million are recorded in other assets 125 million are recorded in accrued liabilities and 02 million are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 27 2020 are deferred losses of 56 million net of tax related to these derivatives 

in addition during the third quarter of 2019 the company hedged a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the british pound sterling in relation to the eone acquisition purchase price and other transaction related costs using a series of both foreign exchange forward and option contracts these contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and as such were marked to market through the companys consolidated statement of operations for tax purposes these contracts qualified as nontaxable integrated tax hedges the company recorded realized gains of 800 million to other income expense net on the matured portion of these contracts for the year ended december 29 2019 the remaining contracts matured on december 30 2019 the closing date of the transaction the net gains or losses recognized in 2020 were immaterial to the companys consolidated financial statements 

at december 27 2020 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 40849 million of this longterm debt 6000 million represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 3000 million of 315 notes due 2021 and 3000 million of 510 notes due 2044 prior to the may 2014 debt issuance the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 5000 million to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 27 2020 are deferred losses net of tax of 165 million related to these derivatives 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit the uk government triggered the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uk’s exit 

tabl e of contents 

on march 29 2017 these events resulted in an immediate weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets which continued through 2019 these fluctuations initially affected hasbro’s financial results although the impact was partially mitigated by the company’s hedging strategy on january 31 2020 the uk formally withdrew from the eu and entered a transitional period which ended on december 31 2020 in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement under which the eu and the uk will now form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu including as it relates to trade transport and visas the company continues to closely monitor the negotiations and the impact to foreign currency markets taking appropriate actions to support the company’s longterm strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities however the company cannot predict the direction of brexitrelated developments nor the impact of those developments on our european operations and the economies of the markets in which they operate 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s toys and games and licensed consumer products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five retail customers accounted for approximately 35 of its consolidated net revenues in 2020 and 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2019 and 2018 the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2020 approximately 64 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers as well as growth in ecommerce result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

unlike the companys retail sales patterns revenue patterns from the companys entertainment businesses fluctuate based on the timing and popularity of television film streaming and digital content releases release dates are determined by factors including the timing of holiday periods geographical release dates and competition in the market in addition entertainment business operating results fluctuate due to expenses recorded in relation to film and television productions and content such as program amortization costs and advertising expenses which are incurred and recognized beginning prior to initial releases and then continue throughout the related distribution windows 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2020 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

storytelling and other entertainment initiatives 

our brand blueprint focuses on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums including television film digital gaming and live action experiences 

as part of our brand blueprint strategy we seek to build our brands through entertainmentbased storytelling historically allspark pictures and allspark animation have been responsible for hasbros entertainmentdriven brand storytelling including the development and global distribution of television programming and motion pictures primarily based on our brands as we integrate eones creative talent and network of studios we expect eone to lead the companys entertainmentdriven brand storytelling with the addition of production studios that span film television and music and include family programming digital content distribution international feature film distribution and live entertainment 

television programming based on our brands currently airs in markets throughout the world domestically allspark animation primarily distributes programming to discovery family channel the “network” a joint venture between discovery communications inc “discovery” and hasbro which operates a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming beginning in 2015 allspark animation began distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network internationally allspark animation distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks allspark animation also distributes programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix in 2016 hasbro acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland that produces a variety of projects for allspark animation and allspark pictures 

during 2014 we introduced allspark pictures hasbro’s film label as a vehicle to produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands beginning in 2020 we plan to leverage eones production expertise to enhance the companys film television and animated production initiatives 

in october 2017 the company entered into an agreement with paramount pictures “paramount” to produce and distribute live action and animated films as well as television programming based on hasbro brands over a fiveyear period hasbro’s allspark pictures allspark animation and eone will play an active role alongside paramount in content development and production under this relationship and hasbro will play a more significant role in financing the films the company’s storytelling initiatives which we believe will be enhanced through the expertise and creative talent of eone support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages accessible anytime in many forms and formats 

recent films released by allspark pictures include the following 

 jointly allspark pictures and paramount pictures have several upcoming feature length films with planned release dates in 2020 and 2021 

in addition to film and television initiatives hasbro understands the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement including in gaming and across other media and of integrating such content with our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which extend storylines and enhance play in 2018 the company launched magic the gathering arena the freetoplay online adaptation of the magic the gathering card game which launched out of open beta late in the third quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2019 to support the companys wizards of the coasts digital gaming business the company acquired tuque games tuque an independent digital game development studio based in montreal canada tuque will focus on the development of digital games for brands such as dungeons  dragons 

in october 2019 the company made the decision to close our wholly owned subsidiary backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer and producer of digital applications the company plans to continue to support backflip’s existing mobile gaming apps in the nearterm 

as we begin to leverage the immersive entertainment capabilities gained through the eone acquisition we will aim to strengthen our competencies around the brand blueprint such as in storytelling and digital complement our current product offerings enter into areas which are adjacent or complementary to our existing business add to our brand portfolio and further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats 

brand portfolios 

hasbro organizes and markets owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within our brand architecture under the following four brand portfolios 1 franchise brands 2 partner brands 3 hasbro gaming and 4 emerging brands 

franchise brands franchise brands are hasbro’s most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm our seven franchise brands are baby alive magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers in 2019 2018 and 2017 franchise brands were 51 53 and 52 of total net revenues respectively 

partner brands partner brands include those brands licensed by hasbro from other parties for which hasbro develops toy and game products significant partner brands include marvel including spiderman and the avengers star wars disney princess and disney frozen disney‘s descendants beyblade dreamworks’ trolls and sesame street partner brands marvel star wars disney’s descendants disney princess and disney frozen are all owned by the walt disney company “disney” partner brand revenues fluctuate based primarily on the entertainment releases around these brands in any given year 

in 2019 hasbro product lines were supported by the following theatrical releases captain marvel in march avengers end game in april spiderman far from home in july frozen 2 in november and star wars the rise of skywalker in december the release of frozen 2 in november supported the company’s disney frozen product line in 2019 which is expected to continue into 2020 

in 2018 hasbro product lines were supported by the following theatrical releases black panther in february avengers infinity war in april and spiderman into the spiderverse in december in addition hasbro’s products were supported by the may release of solo a star wars story 

hasbro gaming hasbro continues to transform game play through our strong portfolio of gaming brands digital integration the mining of social media trends to garner consumer insights and capitalize on popular gaming themes and the rapid introduction of innovative new gaming brands and play experiences hasbro gaming includes brands such as connect 4 dungeons  dragons jenga the game of life operation scrabble trivial pursuit and twister in addition hasbro’s games portfolio also includes new social games brands as well as many other wellknown game brands to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider brands which may capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for face to face trading card and digital game experiences played as board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card and roleplaying games 

emerging brands emerging brands are those owned or controlled hasbro brands which have not achieved franchise brand status but many of which the company believes have the potential to do so over time with investment and further development hasbro emerging brands include brands such as littlest pet shop easy bake furreal friends playskool supersoaker and most recently the power rangers brand which we purchased in 2018 the power rangers brand is currently supported by new television programming which began in 2019 the emerging brands portfolio also includes the lost kitties brand as well as new brands currently being developed by the company and other brands not captured in our other three categories during 2020 hasbro plans to sell products related to snake eyes the action adventure featurelength film based on the emerging brands gi joe character snake eyes the film is being produced jointly by allspark and paramount pictures and is expected to be released in october 2020 

in 2020 as a result of the eone acquisition hasbro enhances its current brand portfolio offerings with the introduction of several brands that already have global appeal commencing in fiscal 2020 eone brands including peppa pig pj masks and ricky zoom will be reported in the emerging brands portfolio the film  tv revenues will be reported in a new brand portfolio eone entertainment 

going forward hasbro expects to benefit from the addition of an attractive set of new brands currently under development 

segments 

for periods presented in this form 10k our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment licensing and digital the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to our principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment licensing and digital segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the movie and television operations of allspark pictures allspark animation and boulder studios and the digital gaming operations of our wizards of the coast business in addition the segment engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for digital gaming and consumer products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments 

commencing in fiscal 2020 following the completion of our acquisition of eone we expect to add a new reportable segment which encompasses the operations of eone 

us and canada our us and canada segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through constant innovation and reinvention this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence as of december 29 2019 we had offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries 

in addition to growing brands leveraging opportunistic product lines and driving our licensed business we seek to grow our international business by continuing to strategically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia africa and latin and south america in 2019 we opened an office in vietnam and in 2018 we opened an office in japan emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” net revenues from emerging markets represented 13 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2019 while in 2018 and 2017 net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2019 net revenues from emerging markets decreased 5 while in 2018 net revenues in emerging markets decreased 12 from 2017 

in 2019 and 2018 the strengthening of the us dollar against many of the foreign currencies within the company’s international segment had a negative impact on segment net revenues the impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues as compared to the prior year translation rates for 2019 and 2018 was 765 million and 417 million respectively financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

entertainment licensing and digital our entertainment licensing and digital segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations 

our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands through the development of digital games based on hasbro brands in 2018 the company launched the magic the gathering arena online game and is also developing esports initiatives as well as a digital game around the dungeons  dragons brand 

furthermore in addition to digital game development hasbro also promotes brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with 

electronic arts inc activision ubisoft scopely and others we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation 

although hasbro closed backflip a mobile game development studio during 2019 hasbro remains committed to digital gaming as part of our longterm strategy and we continue to pursue opportunities to invest where we see growth potential one such investment as mentioned above was the purchase of tuque during the fourth quarter of 2019 tuque is a digital game development studio based in montreal canada that is developing digital games for wizards of the coast brands 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment licensing and digital segment 

as we integrate eone into our business we expect to have further potential for revenue growth and expanded franchise economics with branddriven animation and live action television and film entertainment driven by eone 

global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv “cartamundi” cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us in their two facilities under a multiyear manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes over time we are increasing the amount of product we source outside china including in india and vietnam see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

three of our four product categories namely franchise brands partner brands and hasbro gaming generate approximately 10 or more of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements which is included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues is earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are necessarily indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2019 and 2018 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 64 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters 

in 2019 accounting for 33 and 31 respectively of full year net revenues and the third and fourth quarters in 2018 accounting for 34 and 30 respectively of full year net revenues 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarters as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2019 we primarily utilized cash from our operations and to a lesser extent uncommitted lines of credit in certain international markets to meet our cash flow requirements in addition to the uncommitted international lines of credit used in 2019 we also have available a 15 billion committed revolving credit agreement as well as a 10 billion commercial paper program supported by the revolving credit agreement available to fund our working capital requirements 

as we integrate eone into our business our working capital requirements may change further we expect that our entertainment business will be subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film cinema releases physical home entertainment and television and digital content releases which could impact our working capital needs 

product development and royalties 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments these costs include activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired or licensed by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories or may be nonexclusive in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

our entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content with the acquisition of eone we expect these royalties and participations to become more significant 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “eretailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors eretailers and wholesalers 

customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks include potential damage to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of one or more of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or other unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market 

during 2019 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated global net revenues including our largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and amazoncom who represented 18 9 and 8 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from our top three customers the bankruptcy filing and subsequent liquidation of toys“r”us had a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability in 2018 prior to 2018 toys“r”us was hasbro’s third largest us customer and our second largest customer in europe in addition to lost sales the toys“r”us liquidation in 2018 led to a significant amount of inventory sold at significant discount we believe the bankruptcy of toys“r”us was partially a product of underlying changes in the industry including the rapid growth of online retail globally in europe the bankruptcy of toys“r”us together with economic headwinds in a number of markets and the shifting retail environment magnified the negative impact to sales and profitability overall these changes accelerated our efforts to diversify our retail mix in 2019 and we further prioritized a digitalfirst approach in order to become a more complete ecommerce partner in 2020 and moving forward we plan to continue to focus on the ongoing evolution of our business to succeed in a digitalfirst increasingly ecommerce driven world and to better position us for longterm success amidst the rapidly changing retail environment 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives allspark animation produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix in addition allspark pictures and allspark animation produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands as we integrate eone we expect that the creative talent at eone will help activate and reignite our brands including brands from our vault by leading the creation of content based on our brands 

we introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year partner brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release as such advertising expenditures will be less as a percentage of sales in years where we have significant partner brand sales of products based on major motion picture releases 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 we incurred 4137 million 4399 million and 5018 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2019 the majority of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement we are continuing our efforts to diversify our global sourcing mix and decrease our dependence on chinese manufacturing by increasing production of our products in other countries including india and vietnam eone products are currently managed and distributed through third party licensing agents over time we plan to look for opportunities to insource production distribution and licensing of products relating to eones brands 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2020 for our products however if we or our suppliers suffer prolonged manufacturing disruptions due to public health conditions such as the coronavirus manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as supply of components accessories and our products may be adversely 

impacted see part i item 1a risk factors for further information our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor public health concerns such as the coronavirus or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions tariffs border adjustment taxes or other measures by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other countries where we manufacture significant numbers of products or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china or other countries where we manufacture products such as higher labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured and imported into other markets and damage our sales and profitability 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the development design sale and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our branddriven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films television programs and other entertainment content for example the discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the us competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees our programming distributed both domestically and internationally and allspark animation’s and allspark pictures’ releases compete with content from many other parties eone as an independent distributor and producer competes with major us and international studios that release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in ‑ house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including film libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third ‑ party content any of which could harm our business 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages we refer to this trend as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older 

children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products and screens 

the changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 29 2019 we employed approximately 5600 persons worldwide approximately 2500 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

in addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children our business is subject to other regulations such as the general data protection regulation which became effective in the european union in may 2018 which restricts the collection use and retention of personal information failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities 

further we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

risk factors 

tableend in evaluating our business the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission should be considered carefully additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business the occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow or results of operations this report contains forwardlooking statements please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading special note regarding forwardlooking statements for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements 

risks related to our business 

our strategy involves focusing on franchise and key partner brands and successfully developing or in the case of partner brands successfully working with our partners to develop those brands across our brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games consumer products storytelling and digital experiences if we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience but this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to acquire build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products acquiring developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money with no assurance of success 

our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues if we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands such as power rangers which was acquired in 2018 and peppa pig pj masks and ricky zoom which were acquired as part of our acquisition of eone as of december 30 2019 we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products and entertainment offerings which will be popular with children families and audiences or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands 

the interests of children families and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the everincreasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an everchanging and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles 

consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors such as critical reviews promotions the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and public tastes generally all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that films and television programs we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings that films we distribute or produce will perform well at the box office or in ancillary markets or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library 

if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are investing in designing and marketing products which incorporate more technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

with the increasing array of technology and competitive entertainment offerings we cannot guarantee that 

 technological development including changes in entertainment delivery formats drives frequent changes within the film and television industry and our failure to respond to or capitalize on these changes could harm our business 

the entertainment industry experiences frequent change driven by technological development including developments with respect to the formats through which films television programming and recorded music are delivered to consumers with rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years for example consumers are increasingly accessing television and film content on streaming and digital content networks such as netflix and amazon prime video which has caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of films television programming and recorded music we may also lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner the overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content and the additional costs associated with changing markets media platforms and technologies is unpredictable if we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry our business may be harmed 

engaging storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands 

entertainment media in forms such as television films digital content and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success 

or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties such as licensors film studios content producers and distribution channels with whom we work heavily impact the amount content and timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

in 2019 for example we developed and marketed significant product lines tied to the film releases by key partners of a number of properties including disney’s frozen ii marvel’s avengers endgame marvel’s captain marvel marvel’s spiderman and star wars the rise of skywalker those films are developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such films other key partner product lines we offer such as disney princess disneys descendants and beyblade depend on television support by our partners for their successes 

similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment in which we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves such as transformers power rangers and my little pony in the future we expect to have an even greater role in developing our own entertainment offerings for our brands including those in our vault through eone’s expertise experience and relationships in the entertainment industry as we work together to unlock value in our brands if films television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will fall 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors studio content distribution and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular film projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future films and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not to develop such entertainment 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases or other public health pandemics such as the global coronavirus outbreak currently being experienced in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could substantially harm our business 

disease outbreaks and other public health conditions such as the global outbreak of the coronavirus currently being experienced in markets in which we our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business the occurrence of these types of events can result and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in disruptions and damage to our business caused by both the negative impact to our ability to design develop manufacture and ship product the supply side impact and the negative impact on consumer purchasing behavior the demand side impact the negative impact to supply can be driven by manufacturing and other work stoppages factory and other business closings slowdowns or delays including in china where a substantial portion of our manufacturing occurs restrictions and limitations placed on workers and factories including quarantines and other limitations on the ability to travel and return to work and shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials the negative impact to demand can be caused by delays in or reduced purchases from customers and consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner and may have lower discretionary income due to reduced or limited work while we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus to our business the efforts will not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and the longer the outbreak impacts supply and demand the more negative the impact it will have on our business revenues and earnings and the more limited our ability will be to try and make up for delayed or lost product development production and sales the coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain making it difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations if our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions such as the coronavirus we believe our business could be substantially harmed 

we depend on third party relationships with studios content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content and those relationships are critical to our operations 

under our relationship with paramount and now through our ownership of eone we are playing a more significant role in the production and financing of films based on our properties this has the advantage of giving us more input as to what and when properties are developed into films and can allow us to earn a greater return from successful films but it also increases the money we directly spend on film production and puts that investment at risk if our films are not as successful as we anticipate they will be or if we are not able to produce and distribute films according to the schedule we have planned due to creative or other difficulties or delays our financial performance will be negatively impacted 

additionally eone obtains distribution rights for films from third‑party content producers and produce television programs sold through a number of distribution channels our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these content producers and distribution channels some of these content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate and some of these distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers these content producers and distribution channels may decide or be required by their respective parent companies to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us for distribution or content production our business may be harmed if the content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop licensing content to us or purchasing content from us on favorable terms or at all and we are unable to establish new relationships to ensure the acquisition and sale of content in a timely and efficient manner 

the play and entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the play and entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the us and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase in 2018 for example our nerf branded products faced significantly increased competition from both newer entrants into the blaster space as well as from private label offerings from major retailers a number of these competitors sought to gain market share by offering products with less innovation than our products at price points below our products particularly by offering blasters in the under 20 retail price range 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

we face competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers 

our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films and television programs for example the discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the us competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers 

advertising revenue and distribution fees our programming distributed both domestically and internationally and allspark animation’s and allspark pictures’ releases compete with content from many other parties entertainment one as an independent distributor and producer competes with major us and international studios that release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues and television airtime as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies 

many of the major us studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime in addition the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets including film libraries that we might also be interested in acquiring the competition we face may cause us to lose market share achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content any of which could harm our business 

we cannot guarantee that our entertainment business will be successful lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by our entertainment business and products related to that content could significantly harm our business 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business further ecommerce and omnichannel is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

our success depends on our ongoing ability to successfully evolve our capabilities and business to meet the challenges of a changing retail landscape and to successfully develop new and expanded aspects of our business 

our success depends on our ability to continue evolving and transforming our business to address a changing global consumer landscape and retail environment one in which online shopping accounts for an increasing percentage of total sales to consumers digital first marketing is critical to garner and develop consumer interest ecommerce focused companies like amazoncom inc are now among our largest customers traditional brick and mortar retailers face challenges to their businesses from the disintermediation caused by the expanding prevalence of online shopping and the presence of specialty toy retailers has been significantly reduced in many of our markets due to bankruptcies such as that of toys“r”us potentially reducing at least in the shorter term physical shelf space available to offer family entertainment properties these market conditions require that we drive a digitalfirst orientation throughout our company adapt the way we produce and distribute our products to meet the needs of ecommerce retailers and continue developing alternate retail channels to reach our consumers and recapture shelf space lost by specialty retailers 

in addition to successfully driving our business in a changing retail landscape our future success depends on developing new and expanded areas of our business through our acquisition of eone we have made significant investments in our business that we believe can accelerate our brand blueprint strategy we have added global preschool brands new storytelling capabilities veteran leadership and expertise in television and film which we believe can build and strengthen our brands and improve our franchise economics another area we have invested considerable time and resources is our initiative to drive our dungeons  dragons brand through development 

of digital gaming as well as our magic the gathering brand through digital gaming and esports through our magic the gathering arena online game and our magic the gathering esports initiative to grow our business through these and other initiatives we require different skills investments and business strategies than more traditional areas of our business and our ability to successfully and profitably develop and deploy those skills and strategies and drive those businesses will be a major factor in achieving future success for our company failure to execute on our initiatives could harm our business 

our substantial business sales and manufacturing operations outside the us subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the us we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets such as eastern europe latin america africa and asia additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in the far east to produce most of our products these international operations including operations in emerging markets have unique consumer preferences and business climates present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

 tariffs increase the costs of our products and can lower sales the current tariff environment particularly the imposition or threat of tariffs on products manufactured in china for import into the us has negatively impacted our business and may continue to negatively impact our business sales and profitability the threat and imposition of tariffs have resulted in the elimination of some direct import orders where customers take ownership of products near the source of supply and import the product themselves into the us in favor of shifting to domestic orders which requires us to ship the products to the us and import and warehouse the products prior to delivery to the customer this shift to domestic orders raises the cost to us can result in delays in the time of a sale and may result in the potential loss of some orders entirely due to the lack of timely supply or other delays we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement actions to lessen the impact of tariffs imposed on our products including any changes to our supply chain logistics capabilities sales policies or pricing of our products 

because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with more tariffs 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the us dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers or other factors negatively impacting retail sales can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the us and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability these challenges can be exacerbated if our customers accumulate excess retail inventories over time due to their purchases of our products exceeding sales of those products to ultimate consumers it can then take us significant time working with our retailers to reduce those excess retail inventories and in the interim our sales of new products can be negatively impacted 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we and our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions such as the coronavirus as described above in the markets we our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business the occurrence of these types of events can result and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in manufacturing and other work stoppages slowdowns and delays shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues prolonged occurrences of adverse health conditions could harm our business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment products we offer weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for 

paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic such as the coronavirus a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as brexit may have an adverse effect on our operations 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk formally withdrew from the european union eu entering a transitional period which is currently expected to end on december 31 2020 during this transitional period eu law will continue to apply in the uk while providing time for the uk and eu to negotiate the details of their future relationship if at the end of the transitional period the uk leaves the european union with no agreement it may result in increased costs of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations we continue to closely monitor the negotiations and the impact to foreign currency markets however we cannot predict the direction of brexitrelated developments or the impact of those developments on our european and eone operations and the economies of the markets in which they operate 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain renew and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars disney princess and disney frozen beyblade and dreamworks’ trolls our agreements relating to marvel and star wars were extended in february 2020 these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars and beyblade licenses have been highly significant to our business if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be maintained renewed or extended or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess disney frozen dreamworks’ trolls yokaiwatch or beyblade and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations 

acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore we cannot assure you that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire maintain renew or extend successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

we have long‑term output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all 

through the acquisition of eone in 2020 we have long‑term agreements to acquire and distribute content these agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget subject to maximum amounts payable per film and a cap on the maximum number of films that can be delivered to us each year in addition we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs 

as these contracts expire we may choose to renew renegotiate or terminate them equally these arrangements are terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances including unremedied material breach if we are unable to renew or replace them on acceptable terms we may not be able to replace this content with single film acquisitions even if these contracts are renewed or replaced the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these long‑term contracts may decrease there can also be no assurance that revenues based on these long‑term contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs 

our business is seasonal and therefore our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response or just in time inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs further ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers as a result customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occurs in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occurs in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier this can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders further pressuring our supply chain as we experienced in 2019 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and 

respond to consumer demand resulting in under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations 

our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film cinema releases physical home entertainment and television and digital content releases release dates are determined by several factors including the timing of holiday periods the us release date of the film and competition in the market 

as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster a terrorist attack or economic shock that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for example for the fiscal year ended december 29 2019 walmart stores inc target corporation and amazoncom accounted for approximately 18 9 and 8 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition 

as an example of this the bankruptcy filing by toys“r”us in the us and canada in september 2017 and in the united kingdom in early 2018 and the subsequent liquidations of the toys“r”us business in many markets globally during 2018 as well as the inability of toys“r”us to pay certain outstanding receivables significantly reduced our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018 the liquidation of millions of units of retail inventory held by toys“r”us into the market at closeout prices had a more substantial negative impact to sales of new products by us in 2018 than we and industry experts had initially expected in early 2018 

customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our other significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

all of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters adverse health conditions or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions such as the coronavirus and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slowdowns product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the us natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs border adjustment taxes trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the us or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the us or europe shift more orders to domestic sales put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us delay the time of our sales to retailers result in some lost sales and otherwise harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in china such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like india vietnam and mexico as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets including in the us we plan to continue those efforts in future years but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan furthermore many of these newer production facilities such as in india and vietnam raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in china that means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world in the entertainment industry experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense the impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships loss of creative talent lost productivity hiring and training costs all of which could result in lower profitability we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and employees we need to succeed 

recently we have experienced significant changes in our workforce due to our acquisition of eone as well as our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business the changes in our employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets have required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously develop new skills and work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but we cannot guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on a select number of global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however we cannot guarantee we will achieve our cost savings and efficiency enhancing goals and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from these initiatives 

in response to the continuing evolution of the global consumer landscape shopping behaviors and the retail environment in recent years we have taken certain actions as part of our ongoing efforts to transform and reimagine our business to strengthen our connections with audiences and consumers and enhance our ability to continue bringing meaningful brand experiences to life these actions included a commercial reorganization as well as adding new capabilities based on our understanding of changing consumer behaviors and how our retailers are going to market while also changing many of the ways we organize across our brand blueprint the actions also included headcount reductions aimed at rightsizing our coststructure we cannot guarantee that our restructuring actions will deliver the costreductions we estimate or that our ongoing efforts to evolve our business will be as successful as we plan 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the us and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the us and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights including the possibility of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our productions or certain portions or applications of our intended productions which could have a material adverse effect on our business we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products productions or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets declines in the profitability of acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we may incur impairments and write‑offs if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition production marketing and distribution costs 

we incur significant costs to acquire produce and distribute content most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties the minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets and actual results may differ from those estimates if sales do not meet our original estimates we may i not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit ii not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses iii record accelerated amortization andor fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid or iv not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired 

with respect to content we produce we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value in any given quarter if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project we may be required to accelerate 

amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results 

similarly our business could be harmed by greaterthanexpected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel if the discovery family channel is not successful our investments may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

we incurred significant indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of eone as a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debt or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments  

we incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eone the increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company 

in particular our increased indebtedness could 

 we have relied on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we may rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 10000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity we cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a 15000 million committed revolving credit facility effective upon completion of the acquisition of eone on december 30 2019 this facility is a further source of working capital funding and liquidity and supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit 

agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default we cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

the production of films and television programs require a substantial investment of capital and utilizes production financing to invest in productions 

with the acquisition of eone we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions which eone has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms in the event that we are unable to provide eone with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable for example if finance providers become unwilling or unable due to creditors’ own constraints and ability to lend to provide production financing on reasonable commercial terms or at all we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production in this case we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we aim to do as part of our business plan and strategy which could harm our business 

following our acquisition of eone the distribution of canadian certified content is an important part of our business and we benefit from funding from the canadian government 

eones canadian business utilizes certain government incentive programs and tax credits in canada to finance a portion of its production budgets if these incentive programs or tax credits were to be reduced amended or eliminated or if eone no longer qualified for these programs or tax credits our and eone’s business financial condition operating results or prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

the loss of canadian status of entertainment one canada ltd could result in the loss of licenses incentives and tax credits 

through our acquisition of eone we indirectly acquired all of the nonvoting equity shares and preferred shares in entertainment one canada ltd “eocl” and b 25 of the voting shares in eocl the remaining 75 of the voting shares in eocl are held by independent shareholders who are not controlled by us eocl is able to benefit from a number of licenses incentive programs and canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “canadian” as defined in the investment canada act as part of our acquisition of eone we have taken measures to ensure that eocl’s canadian status is maintained there can be no assurance however that we will be able to maintain eocls canadian status the loss of eocl’s canadian status could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results or prospects including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to eocl 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the us under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world the collection of personally identifiable information from anyone including adults is under increasing regulation in many markets and in may 2018 the general data protection regulation became effective in the european union while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

our business also involves risks of liability claims for media content which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a distributor and producer of media content we may face potential liability for defamation invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed these types of claims have been brought sometimes successfully against producers and distributors of media content any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results or prospects 

our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions 

our entertainment business is directly or indirectly dependent upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs a strike by or a lockout of one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business and that is likely to continue in the future acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product 

offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target brands assets or companies that we believe offer attractive entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies or other synergies 

we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or to grow our business in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future we cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business for additional risks relating to our acquisition of eone see “ risks related to our business following the acquisition of eone ” 

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe 

upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations for example during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted in changes to the longterm projections for the backflip business which led the company to conclude the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired which led to an impairment charge for the year ended december 30 2018 

risks related to our business following the consummation of the acquisition of eone 

we may not realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition of eone 

while we expect the acquisition of eone to result in significant synergies and to be accretive to earnings per share on an adjusted earnings basis that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “us gaap” this expectation is based on estimates and assumptions about among other things our and eone’s business the amount of revenues and savings that can be generated from moving a significant portion of eone’s family brand licensing business inhouse our ability to enhance the profitability of eone’s licensing and merchandising activities the ability of the combined company to employ its enhanced capabilities in television film and music to grow the overall business and successfully develop and drive branded entertainment including entertainment based on our brands and the ability of the combined company to successfully ideate and develop future intellectual property and brand extensions these estimates and assumptions may be inaccurate and may change materially over time reducing or eliminating the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition further this expectation is also based on the assumption that we are able to successfully integrate eone’s business and operations with our business and operations and that we are able to effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition 

we may be unable to successfully integrate our and eone’s businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition within the intended timeframe or at all and our acquisition of eone will expose us to risks related to eone’s business  

if we are unable to successfully integrate eone’s business and operations with our business and operations we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in the timeframe that we expect or at all any integration issues we face could also have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the acquisition including by adversely affecting our relationships with customers consumers suppliers employees or other constituencies any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process or otherwise after the consummation of the acquisition include the following 

 in addition we will also assume risks unique to the nature of eone’s business these risks are described above under “ risks related to our business ” 

our results after the consummation of the acquisition may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

following the consummation of the acquisition the size and complexity of our business has increased beyond the current size of our or eone’s existing business our future success depends in part upon our ability to successfully manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of a significantly larger brand portfolio and complex organization across many global jurisdictions additional revenue growth and expanded franchise economics expected as a result of the acquisition we cannot assure you that we will be successful after completion of the acquisition or that we will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from the acquisition 

  the consummation of the acquisition may expose us to unknown liabilities 

because we have acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of eone we have assumed responsibility for all of its liabilities if there are unknown liabilities or other obligations including contingent liabilities our business could be materially affected as a distributor and producer of media content eone faces potential liability for causes of action such as defamation invasion of privacy or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed we may also learn additional information regarding eone that adversely affects us such as issues that could affect our ability to comply with the sarbanesoxley act or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws 

the combined company will record goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material noncash charges to the results of operations of the combined company in the future 

the acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition by hasbro in accordance with us gaap under the acquisition method of accounting goodwill as of the acquisition date will be measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is generally measured at a fair value net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed which are also measured at their fair value goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows declines in operating results divestitures markets and other factors that may impact the fair value of a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and in turn a charge to net income such a charge would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes additionally the company identified the valuation of the company’s equity method investment in discovery family channel as a significant accounting estimate 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company adopted accounting standards update no 201704 asu 201704 intangibles goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  the standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all assets and liabilities within that unit “the step 2 test” from the goodwill impairment test instead if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative impairment testing process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists 

if it is more likely than not that impairment exists a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed when performing a quantitative impairment test goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit which is calculated using an income approach other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4946 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessments the company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill to reporting units tested using the qualitative approach during 2019 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted in a modification to the company’s longterm plan for its backflip business these modifications included organizational actions and related personnel changes the extension of launch dates for games currently in or planned for development and the addition of partners for the development of future game releases the modifications resulted in changes to the longterm projections for the backflip business which led the company to conclude the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 19 was utilized representing the reporting unit’s estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the impairment test the company determined that the carrying value of the backflip reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value the company recorded an impairment charge of 863 million within administrative expense and in the company’s entertainment licensing and digital segment during the fourth quarter of 2018 which was the full amount of remaining goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit subsequently during 2019 the company made the decision to close the backflip business 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable there were no triggering events in 2019 which would indicate impairment existed in the companys intangible assets during 2019 

as part of its assessment of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company completed impairment testing relating to certain property rights both owned or related to license agreements specifically the company reviewed intangible assets recorded in connection with licensed property rights and owned technology due to a decline in revenue and revised projections for future revenue it was determined that the intangible asset carrying values exceeded expected future cash flows indicating that the intangible asset was impaired and resulted in a charge of 313 million recorded within administrative expense 

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit in addition on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that established new tax laws in 2018 including but not limited to reducing the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 and creating new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments 

in may 2019 a public referendum held in switzerland approved swiss federal act on tax reform and ahv financing traf proposals previously approved by swiss parliament the swiss tax reform measures are effective on january 1 2020 changes in tax reform include the abolishment of preferential tax regimes for holding companies domicile companies and mixed companies at the cantonal level the enacted changes in swiss federal 

tax were not material to the companys consolidated financial statements swiss cantonal tax was enacted in december 2019 due to the uncertain nature of the cantonal legislation the company is still assessing the transitional provision options it may elect however the pending legislation is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements we will continue to review traf as the swiss authorities provide additional interpretive guidance on the new law and related transitional methodology 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized in the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized in the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return 

valuation of equity method investment in discovery family channel 

the company owns an interest in a joint venture discovery family channel “the network” with discovery communications inc “discovery” the company has determined that it does not meet the control requirements to consolidate the network and accounts for the investment using the equity method of accounting the network was established to create a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment in october 2009 the company purchased an initial 50 share in the network for a payment of 300 million and certain future tax payments based on the value of certain tax benefits expected to be received by the company in september 2014 the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to the network and discovery increased its equity interest in the network to 60 while the company retained a 40 equity interest in the network 

the company tests its equity method investment in the network for impairment annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company’s valuation of its equity method investment in the network includes assumptions surrounding forecasted revenue and expenses a discount rate and a terminal growth rate which are used to estimate the fair value of the investment and involve a high degree of subjectivity given the volatility in consumer interest when choosing entertainment media 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce products under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 40849 million in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 29 2019 future payments required under these and other obligations expressed in millions of dollars as of december 29 2019 are as follows 



on december 30 2019 the company borrowed 10 billion under its term loan facilities in order to finance in part the acquisition of eone the maturities of the term loan facilities are 225 million in 2020 300 million in 2021 4525 million in 2022 600 million in 2023 and 4350 million in 2024 

 other expected future payments 

from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments as such these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below 

 the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts at december 29 2019 the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 433 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 29 2019 these contracts had net unrealized gains of 437 million of which 423 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 67 million are recorded in other assets and 53 million are recorded in accrued liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 29 2019 are deferred gains of 127 million net of tax related to these derivatives 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company hedged a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the british pound sterling in relation to the eone acquisition purchase price and other transaction related costs using a series of both foreign exchange forward and option contracts these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and as such were marked to market through the companys consolidated statement of operations as of december 29 2019 these derivative instruments had a total notional value of 44688 million and a net fair value of 341 million which is recorded to prepaid expenses and other assets within the companys consolidated financial statements in addition the company recorded gains of 800 million on matured contracts to other income expense net for the year ended december 29 2019 

at december 29 2019 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 40849 million of this longterm debt 6000 million represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 3000 million of 315 notes due 2021 and 3000 million of 510 notes due 2044 prior to the may 2014 debt issuance the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 5000 million to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 29 2019 are deferred losses net of tax of 179 million related to these derivatives 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted in a referendum to leave the eu commonly referred to as brexit the uk government triggered the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uk’s exit on march 29 2017 these events resulted in an immediate weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets which continued through 2019 these fluctuations initially affected hasbro’s financial results although the impact was partially mitigated by the company’s hedging strategy on january 31 2020 the uk formally withdrew from the eu entering a transitional period which is currently expected to end on december 31 2020 during this transitional period eu law will continue to apply in the uk while providing time for the uk and eu to negotiate the details of their future relationship financial trade and legal implications of the uk leaving the eu remain uncertain the company continues to closely monitor the negotiations and the impact to foreign 

currency markets taking appropriate actions to support the company’s longterm strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities however the company cannot predict the direction of brexitrelated developments nor the impact of those developments on our european operations and the economies of the markets in which they operate 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2019 and 2018 and 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2017 the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2019 approximately 64 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2019 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly 

coronavirus outbreak 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus currently being experienced in markets in which we our employees consumers customers suppliers and manufacturers operate could have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business while we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus to our business the efforts will not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and the longer the outbreak impacts supply and demand the more negative the impact it will have on our business revenues and earnings and the more limited our ability will be to try and make up for delayed or lost product development production and sales the coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain making it difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations please see part i item 1a risk factors for further information

2018 impairment charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted in a modification to the company’s longterm plan for its backflip business these modifications included organizational actions and related personnel changes the extension of launch dates for games currently in or planned for development and the addition of partners for the development of future game releases the modifications resulted in changes to the longterm projections for the backflip business which led the company to conclude the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired the company recorded an impairment charge of 863 million within administrative expense and in the company’s entertainment and licensing segment for the year ended december 30 2018 

the company also concluded that certain intangible assets were also impaired during the fourth quarter of 2018 these impairments were primarily the result of changes to revenue projections that became apparent after the recent holiday period this resulted in recording an impairment charge of 313 million recorded within administrative expense and in the company’s corporate and eliminations segment in the year ended december 30 2018

storytelling and other entertainment initiatives 

our brand blueprint focuses on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums including television motion pictures and digital content 

as part of our brand blueprint we seek to build our brands through entertainmentbased storytelling allspark pictures and allspark animation are responsible for entertainmentdriven brand storytelling including the development and global distribution of television programming and motion pictures primarily based on our brands 

  

television programming based on our brands currently airs in markets throughout the world domestically allspark animation primarily distributes programming to discovery family channel the “network” a joint venture between discovery communications inc “discovery” and hasbro which operates a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming beginning in 2015 allspark animation began distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network internationally allspark animation distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks allspark animation also distributes programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix and itunes in 2016 hasbro acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland in addition to working on a variety of projects for allspark animation and allspark pictures boulder media continues to produce nonhasbro content under the boulder name 

during 2014 we introduced allspark pictures hasbro’s film label as a vehicle to produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands our plan is to continue to produce live action entertainment including film and television under the allspark pictures moniker and to produce animated entertainment under the allspark animation label in october 2017 the company entered into an agreement with paramount pictures “paramount” to produce and distribute live action and animated films as well as television programming based on hasbro brands over a fiveyear period hasbro’s allspark pictures and allspark animation will play an active role alongside paramount in content development and production under this relationship and hasbro will play a more significant role in financing the films as well the company’s storytelling initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages accessible anytime in many forms and formats 

recent films released by allspark pictures include the following 

 

  

  

 in addition to film and television initiatives hasbro understands the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement including in gaming and across other media and of integrating such content with our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which extend storylines and enhance play our whollyowned subsidiary backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer produces digital applications while certain of our trademarks characters and other property rights are licensed by third parties in connection with digital gaming we anticipate increasingly leveraging and applying backflip’s digital gaming expertise to hasbro brands in 2019 and beyond 

as we seek to grow our business in entertainment licensing digital gaming and innovative product offerings we will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like allspark animation and allspark pictures boulder media the network and backflip which may allow us to strengthen our competencies around the brand blueprint such as in storytelling and digital complement our current product offerings allow us entry into areas which are adjacent or complementary to our existing business allow us to add to our brand portfolio or allow us to further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats 

brand portfolios 

hasbro organizes and markets owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within our brand architecture under the following four brand portfolios 1 franchise brands 2 partner brands 3 hasbro gaming and 4 emerging brands 

franchise brands franchise brands are hasbro’s most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm our seven franchise brands are baby alive magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers in 2018 2017 and 2016 franchise brands were 53 52 and 47 of total net revenues respectively 

partner brands partner brands include those brands licensed by hasbro from other parties for which hasbro develops toy and game products significant partner brands include marvel including spiderman and the avengers star wars disney princess and disney frozen disney‘s descendants beyblade dreamworks’ trolls and sesame street partner brands marvel star wars disney’s descendants disney princess and disney frozen are all owned by the walt disney company “disney”

in 2018 hasbro product lines were supported by the following theatrical releases black panther in february avengers infinity war in april and spiderman into the spiderverse in december

hasbro gaming hasbro continues to revolutionize game play through our strong portfolio of gaming brands digital integration the mining of social media trends to garner consumer insights and capitalize on popular gaming themes and the rapid introduction of innovative new gaming brands and play experiences hasbro gaming includes brands such as connect 4 dungeons  dragons jenga the game of life operation scrabble trivial pursuit and twister as well as new social games including don’t lose your cool don’t step in it and speech breaker in addition hasbro’s games portfolio also includes many other wellknown game brands to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider brands which may capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for face to face trading card and digital game experiences played as board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card and roleplaying games 

emerging brands emerging brands are those owned or controlled hasbro brands which have not achieved franchise brand status but many of which the company believes have the potential to do so over time with investment and further development hasbro emerging brands include brands such as littlest pet shop easy bake furby furreal friends playskool and most recently the power rangers brand which we purchased in 2018 in 2019 the power rangers brand will be supported by new television programming the emerging brands portfolio also includes new brands such as lost kitties yellies as well as brands currently being developed by the company and other brands not captured in our other three categories 

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to our principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of allspark pictures allspark animation boulder studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for digital gaming and consumer products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments 

us and canada our us and canada segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through constant innovation and reinvention this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries 

  

in addition to growing brands leveraging opportunistic product lines and driving our licensed business we seek to grow our international business by continuing to strategically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia africa and latin and south america in 2018 we opened an office in japan and in 2017 we opened offices in argentina and india emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 in 2018 net revenues from emerging markets decreased 12 while in 2017 net revenues in emerging markets increased 5 from 2016 

in 2018 the strengthening of the us dollar against many of the foreign currencies within the company’s international segment had a negative impact whereas in 2017 the international segment benefited from foreign currency translation the impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues as compared to the prior year translation rates for 2017 and 2016 was 430 million and 753 million respectively financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations 

our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft scopely and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation through backflip our owned mobile game development studio we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including the dragonvale and transformers earth wars games through backflip we intend to continue focusing on our existing game titles and to launch new games including further offerings based on hasbro brands 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv “cartamundi” cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us in their two facilities under a multiyear manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes over time we are increasing the amount of product we source outside china including in india and vietnam see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

three of our four product categories namely franchise brands partner brands and hasbro gaming generate approximately 10 or more of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues is earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are necessarily indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2018 and 2017 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 34 and 31 respectively of full year net revenues 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2018 we primarily utilized cash from our operations and to a lesser extent uncommitted lines of credit in certain international markets to meet our cash flow requirements 

product development and royalties 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments these costs include activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired or licensed by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories or may be nonexclusive in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

  

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “eretailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors eretailers and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks include potential damage to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of one or more of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or other unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market 

during 2018 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated global net revenues including our largest customers walmart stores inc and target corporation who represented 20 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 60 of our net revenues were derived from our top three customers the bankruptcy filing and subsequent liquidation of toys“r”us had a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability in 2018 prior to 2018 toys“r”us was hasbro’s third largest us customer and our second largest customer in europe in addition to lost sales the toys“r”us liquidation in 2018 led to a significant amount of inventory sold at significant discount we believe the bankruptcy of toys“r”us was partially a product of underlying changes in the industry including the rapid growth of online retail globally in europe the bankruptcy of toys“r”us together with economic headwinds in a number of markets and the shifting retail environment magnified the negative impact to sales and profitability overall these changes accelerated our efforts to diversify our retail mix in 2018 and we further prioritized a digitalfirst approach in order to become a more complete ecommerce partner in 2019 and moving forward we plan to continue to focus on an ongoing evolution of our business to succeed in a digitalfirst increasing ecommerce driven world and to better position us for longterm success amidst the rapidly changing retail environment 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives allspark animation produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes in addition allspark pictures and allspark animation produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2018 2017 and 2016 we incurred 4399 million 5018 million and 4689 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2018 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement we are continuing our efforts to diversify our global sourcing mix and decrease our dependence on chinese manufacturing by increasing production of our products in other countries including india and vietnam 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2019 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions tariffs border adjustment taxes or other measures by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us 

  

from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other countries where we manufacture significant numbers of products or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china or other countries where we manufacture products such as higher labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured and imported into other markets and damage our sales and profitability 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the development design sale and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our branddriven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment allspark animation allspark pictures and discovery family channel compete with other children’s and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages we refer to this trend as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products and screens 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 30 2018 we employed approximately 5800 persons worldwide approximately 3200 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” 

  

the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

in addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children our business is subject to other regulations such as the general data protection regulation which became effective in the european union in may 2018 which restricts the collection use and retention of personal information failure to comply with those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities 

further we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve developing a large number of different products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience but this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across the brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money 

in 2018 revenues from our seven franchise brands baby alive magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 53 of our aggregate net revenues revenues from our key partner brands including beyblade disney princess and disney frozen marvel star wars dreamworks’ trolls and yokai watch constituted 22 of our aggregate net revenues in 2018 together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues if we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands such as current emerging brands and elevate them to franchise brand status over time there is no guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully as an example of this process in february 2018 we elevated baby alive to franchise brand status and moved littlest pet shop which we are in the process of reinventing and which requires a different developmental approach at this point out of franchise brands and into emerging brands 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the everincreasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual children’s and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our children’s and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal 

  

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 engaging storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital content and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties such as licensors and motion picture studios with whom we work heavily impact the amount content and timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

in 2018 we developed and marketed significant product lines tied to the motion picture releases by key partners of black panther avengers infinity wars and solo a star wars story in addition we developed and marketed products related to bumblebee a motion picture developed and released by us working with our partner paramount pictures for 2019 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of a number of properties including disney’s aladdin disney’s frozen ii and star wars episode ix those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures other key partner product lines we are offering such as beyblade and yokaiwatch depend on television support by our partners for their successes similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves such as transformers and my little pony if those motion pictures television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will fall 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not to develop such entertainment 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

  

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media we or our partners produce or for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital content or other media we produce or for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our or our partners’ media efforts and related product offerings fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

under the relationship we entered with paramount in october 2017 we plan to play a more significant role in the production and financing of motion pictures based on our properties that has the advantage of giving us more input to what and when properties are developed into motion pictures and can allow us to earn a greater return from successful films but it also increases the money we will directly spend on film production and puts that investment at risk if our motion pictures are not as successful as we anticipate they will be or if we are not able to produce and distribute films according to the schedule we have planned due to creative or other difficulties or delays our financial performance will be negatively impacted 

discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly our programming distributed both domestically and internationally allspark animation’s and allspark pictures’ releases and backflip studio’s digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios allspark animation allspark pictures and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2018 we spent 1320 million for television programming and film projects we are developing and we anticipate that we will spend approximately 650 million to 850 million in 2019 and anticipate comparable or higher levels in future years 

at december 30 2018 2369 million or 45 of our total assets represented our investments in the discovery family channel if the discovery family channel is not successful our investments may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase in 2018 for example our nerf branded products faced significantly increased competition from both newer entrants into the blaster space as well as private label offerings from major retailers a number of these competitors sought to gain market share by offering products with less innovation than our products at price points below our products particularly by offering blasters in the under 20 retail price range 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

  

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business further ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

our success depends on our ongoing ability to successfully evolve our capabilities and business to meet the challenges of a changing retail landscape and to successfully develop new aspects of our business 

2018 was a year of significant retail disruption in our industry our future success depends on our ability to continue evolving and transforming our business to address a changing global consumer landscape and retail environment one in which online shopping accounts for an increasing percentage of total sales to consumers digital first marketing is critical to garner and develop consumer interest ecommerce focused companies like amazoncom inc are now among our largest customers traditional brick and mortar retailers face challenges to their businesses from the disintermediation caused by the expanding prevalence of online shopping and the presence of specialty toy retailers has been significantly reduced in many of our markets due to bankruptcies such as that of toys “r” us potentially reducing at least in the shorter term physical shelf space available to offer family entertainment properties these market conditions require that we drive a digitalfirst orientation throughout our company adapt the way we produce and distribute our products to meet the needs of ecommerce retailers and continue developing alternate retail channels to reach our consumers and recapture shelf space lost by specialty retailers 

in addition to successfully driving our business in a changing retail landscape our future success depends on developing new areas of our business a prime example of that is our initiative to drive our magic the gathering brand through digital gaming and esports we have invested considerable time and resources in our magic the gathering arena online game which is currently in open beta and our magic the gathering esports initiative those initiatives require different skills investments and business strategies than more traditional areas of our business and our ability to successfully and profitably develop and deploy those skills and strategies and drive those businesses will be a major factor in achieving future success for our company 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the us dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be 

  

significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control during 2018 certain key currencies such as the euro russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly against the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings depreciation in key currencies during 2018 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers or other factors negatively impacting retail sales can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability these challenges can be exacerbated if our customers accumulate excess retail inventories over time due to their purchases of our products exceeding sales of those products to ultimate consumers it can then take us significant time working with our retailers to reduce those excess retail inventories and in the interim our sales of new products can be negatively impacted our business in europe in 2018 was significantly reduced by excess retail inventories that we needed to address during the year 

our revenues and profitability for 2018 were negatively impacted by the ongoing economic challenges and resulting lower sales of our products in the united kingdom and in brazil the economic downturn in the united kingdom is partly caused by uncertainly around brexit if these markets or other significant markets experience economic difficulties in 2019 it can harm our business and financial results 

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future including eastern europe latin america africa and asia in 2018 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars disney princess and disney frozen beyblade and dreamworks’ trolls these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars and beyblade licenses have been highly significant to our business in 2016 we began sales of products based on the disney princess and disney frozen properties which contributed to our performance if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques further ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers as a result customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations 

in 2018 we experienced a negative impact to our business from retailers’ continuing efforts to reduce the amount of overall inventory they carry and minimize carryforward inventory coming out of the holiday season additionally some retailers are increasing their use of automated inventory replenishment programs which we believe drove a significant reduction in reorders of our products by these retailers in the last weeks of december 2018 these trends negatively impacted our sales in 2018 if retailers continue to increase their use of automated replenishment programs our inventory levels and sales may fluctuate particularly in the fourth quarter 

  

in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018 walmart stores inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 20 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 60 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition 

as an example of this the bankruptcy filing by toys“r”us in the us and canada in september 2017 and in the united kingdom in early 2018 and the subsequent liquidations of the toys “r” us business in many markets globally during 2018 as well as the inability of toys“r”us to pay certain outstanding receivables significantly reduced our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018 the liquidation of millions of units of retail inventory held by toys“r”us into the market at closeout prices had a more substantial negative impact to sales of new products by us in 2018 than we and industry experts had initially expected in early 2018 

customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our other significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology integrating digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers to continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth we must offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products this is another key to our strategy complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than 

  

for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 30 2018 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 40 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in the far east to produce most of our products these international sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to date tariffs have not had a material adverse impact to our overall business and the only market in which we face significant tariffs currently is in brazil where substantial import tariffs have been in place and do negatively impact our ability to price our products competitively while remaining profitable however if tariffs were to be imposed on substantial quantities of our products such as if the united states were to impose tariffs on substantial quantities of our products manufactured in china and imported into the united states that could have a material negative impact on our business and damage our sales and profitability and take time to offset 

because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment 

  

products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products in 2018 our business was negatively impacted by weaker economic conditions in the united kingdom and brazil two of our significant markets economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess disney frozen dreamworks’ trolls yokaiwatch or beyblade and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 30 2018 we had 727 million of prepaid royalties 383 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 344 million of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 30 2018 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 3878 million acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

with the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015 all of our products are now manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external 

  

sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slowdowns product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs border adjustment taxes trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in china such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like india vietnam and mexico as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets including in the united states we plan to continue those efforts in future years but there is no guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan furthermore many of these newer production facilities such as in india and vietnam raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in china that means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involved substantial changes in how we develop and market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail with a focus on understanding consumer insights rapidly identifying and understanding social media trends understanding popular gaming mechanics and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy involves making fundamental changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for 

  

consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities while reducing our workforce in other areas over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets have required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously develop new skills and work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however there is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings and efficiency enhancing goals and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from these initiatives 

in 2018 in response to the continuing evolution of the global consumer landscape shopping behaviors and the retail environment we took certain actions as part of our ongoing efforts to transform and reimagine our business to strengthen our connections with audiences and consumers and enhance our ability to continue bringing meaningful brand experiences to life these actions defined earlier in this 10k as the 2018 restructuring program included a commercial reorganization as well as adding new capabilities based on our understanding of changing consumer behaviors and how our retailers are going to market while also changing many of the ways we organize across our brand blueprint the actions also included headcount reductions aimed at rightsizing our coststructure under the plan we incurred pretax restructuring charges of 173 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 72 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 relating to severance and other employee costs once these actions are completed we expect that we will generate approximately 70 million to 80 million in gross annualized costreductions by 2020 the company expects that approximately 65 million of these gross savings will be realized in 2019 in line with the objectives of this program we plan to reinvest approximately 10 to 15 million in new resources in 2019 generating a net savings of approximately 50 million to 55 million in 2019 however there is no guarantee that our restructuring actions will deliver the costreductions we currently estimate or that our ongoing efforts to evolve our business will be as successful as we plan 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

  

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 30 2018 we had 6938 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet in 2018 based on estimates of future revenue from these rights we recorded an impairment charge of 313 million declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we have relied on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we may rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital however in 2018 we did not borrow under our commercial paper program or revolving credit facility we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 1000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2023 which provides for a 11000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 30 2018 we had 17099 million of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international 

  

markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world the collection or personally identifiable information from anyone including adults is under increasing regulation in many markets and in may of 2018 the general data protection regulation became effective in the european union while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business and that is likely to continue in the future acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target brands assets or companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies or other synergies in june of 2018 we acquired the power rangers brand from saban properties as we believe this brand has the potential to be developed successfully around our brand blueprint however there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop power rangers as successfully as we believe we can in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or to grow our business 

in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

  

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code we have complied with the tax act and all regulations that have been promulgated our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the continuing interpretation of the tax act 

  

in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties at december 30 2018 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of 503 million while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually at december 30 2018 4859 million or 92 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted changes to the longterm projections for the backflip business which led the company to conclude the goodwill associated with the backflip reporting unit was impaired the company recorded an impairment charge of 863 million for the year ended december 30 2018

storytelling and other entertainment initiatives 

our brand blueprint focuses on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several outlets including television motion pictures and digital content 

as part of our brand blueprint we seek to build our brands through entertainmentbased storytelling hasbro studios is responsible for branddriven storytelling across mediums including the development and global distribution of television programming primarily based on our brands this programming currently airs in markets throughout the world domestically hasbro studios primarily distributes programming to discovery family channel the “network” a joint venture between discovery communications inc “discovery” and ourselves which operates a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming beginning in 2015 hasbro studios began distributing certain 

  

programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network internationally hasbro studios distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks hasbro studios also distributes programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix and itunes in 2016 hasbro acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland in addition to working on a variety of projects for hasbro studios allspark animation and allspark pictures boulder media continues to produce nonhasbro content under the boulder name 

during 2014 we introduced allspark pictures hasbro’s film label as a vehicle to produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands during 2017 we formed allspark animation an additional film label to expand our entertainment services our plan going forward is to produce live action entertainment including film and television under the allspark pictures moniker and to produce animated entertainment under the allspark animation label in october 2017 the company entered into an agreement with paramount pictures “paramount” to produce and distribute live action and animated films as well as television programming based on hasbro brands over a fiveyear period hasbro’s allspark pictures and allspark animation will play an active role alongside paramount in content development and production under this relationship and we will play a more significant role in financing the films as well the company’s storytelling initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages accessible anytime in many forms and formats in october 2016 allspark pictures released ouija origin of evil  in october 2017 allspark pictures released my little pony the movie  in december 2018 through their partnership hasbro and paramount expect to release bumblebee  a film centered on the transformers character bumblebee 

in addition to film and television initiatives hasbro understands the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement including in gaming and across other media and of integrating such content with our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which extend storylines and enhance play as of december 2016 we owned a 70 majority stake in backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer and in january 2017 we increased our ownership to 100 while certain of our trademarks characters and other property rights are licensed by third parties in connection with digital gaming we anticipate increasingly leveraging and applying backflip’s digital gaming expertise to hasbro brands in 2018 and beyond 

as we seek to grow our business in entertainment licensing digital gaming and innovative product offerings we will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios boulder media the network and backflip which may allow us to strengthen our competencies around the brand blueprint such as in storytelling and digital complement our current product offerings allow us entry into areas which are adjacent or complementary to our existing business allow us to add to our brand portfolio or allow us to further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats 

brand portfolios 

hasbro organizes and markets owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within our brand architecture under the following brand portfolios 1 franchise brands 2 partner brands 3 hasbro gaming and 4 emerging brands 

franchise brands franchise brands are hasbro’s most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm in 2017 our seven franchise brands were littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers as reported net revenues from franchise brands grew 10 in 2017 and 2 in 2016 in 2017 2016 and 2015 franchise brands were 49 46 and 52 of total net revenues respectively beginning in 2018 emerging brand baby alive will replace littlest pet shop in the franchise brands lineup based on the historical strength of the baby alive brand and the company’s belief in the sustainability of the brand’s success we are moving littlest pet shop to the emerging brands category to allow us to take a more entrepreneurial approach to that brand and better allow us to reinvent that brand 

partner brands partner brands include those licensed brands for which hasbro develops toy and game products significant partner brands include marvel including spiderman and the avengers star wars disney princess and disney frozen disney‘s descendants beyblade dreamworks’ trolls sesame street and yokai watch partner brands marvel star wars disney’s descendants disney princess and disney frozen are all owned by the walt disney company “disney” 

in 2017 hasbro sold product lines supported by the following theatrical releases from our partners marvel’s guardians of the galaxy vol 2 in may spiderman homecoming in july thor ragnarok in november and star wars the last jedi in december in addition to films featuring our franchise brands 

  

transformers the last knight in june and my little pony the movie  in october in 2016 hasbro sold product supported by four major motion picture releases by our partners captain america civil war dreamworks’ trolls moana and rogue one a star wars story  in 2018 we expect to sell products related to several partner theatrical releases including black panther in february avengers infinity war in may solo a star wars story in may and spiderman into the spiderverse in december as well as the bumblebee film in december from our franchise brand transformers 

hasbro gaming hasbro continues to revolutionize game play through our strong portfolio of gaming brands digital integration the mining of social media trends to garner consumer insights and capitalize on popular gaming themes and the rapid introduction of innovative new gaming brands and play experiences hasbro gaming includes brands such as dungeons  dragons jenga the game of life operation pie face scrabble trivial pursuit and twister as well as social games including fantastic gymnastics speak out and toilet trouble in addition hasbro’s games portfolio also includes many other wellknown game brands to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider brands which may capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for face to face trading card and digital game experiences played as board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card and roleplaying games 

emerging brands emerging brands are those owned or controlled hasbro brands which have not achieved franchise brand status but many of which the company believes have the potential to do so over time with investment and further development through 2017 these included brands such as baby alive furby furreal friends hanazuki kreo playskool and playskool heroes beginning in 2018 the baby alive brand is moving to franchise brands and littlest pet shop will be included in emerging brands the emerging brands portfolio also includes new brands being developed by the company as well as other brands not captured in our other three categories 

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to our principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for digital gaming and consumer products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada our us and canada segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through constant innovation and reinvention this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries 

in addition to growing brands leveraging opportunistic product lines and driving our licensed business we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia africa and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 in 2017 net revenues from emerging markets increased 5 while in 2016 net revenues in emerging markets increased 9 from 2015 

  

in 2017 the international segment benefited from foreign currency translation whereas the strengthening of the us dollar in 2016 had a negative impact on the international segment the impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues as compared to the prior year translation rates for 2017 and 2016 was 753 million and 584 million respectively financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations 

our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft scopely and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation through backflip our owned mobile game development studio we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including the dragonvale and transformers earth wars games through backflip we intend to continue focusing on our existing game titles and to launch new games including further offerings based on hasbro brands 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv “cartamundi” cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us in their two facilities under a multiyear manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

each of our four product categories namely franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands generate approximately 10 or more of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates 

  

of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2017 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 34 and 31 respectively of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2018 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2017 and in prior years 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increases during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2017 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit as well as excess proceeds from the 2017 issuance of longterm debt to meet our cash flow requirements 

product development and royalties 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2017 2016 and 2015 we incurred expenses of 2690 million 2664 million and 2429 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories or may be nonexclusive in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2017 2016 and 2015 we incurred 4055 million 4095 million and 3792 million respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

  

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “eretailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors eretailers and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2017 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation who represented 19 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 61 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers the bankruptcy filing in september 2017 of toys “r” us in the us and canada and the difficulties of toys “r” us in the united kingdom significantly impacted our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 and we expect the financial difficulties of toys “r” us will negatively impact our sales in 2018 with the greatest amount of that impact likely to be in the first half of 2018 as we right size our inventory with toys “r” us and as they close stores 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes in addition allspark pictures and allspark animation produce both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2017 2016 and 2015 we incurred 5018 million 4689 million and 4094 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2017 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our thirdparty manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2018 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions tariffs border adjustment taxes or other measures by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other countries where we manufacture products or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china or other countries where we manufacture products such as higher labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured and imported into other markets 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that 

  

national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the development design sale and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our branddriven storytelling for consumer attention businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other children’s and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages we refer to this trend as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 31 2017 we employed approximately 5400 persons worldwide approximately 2800 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety 

  

standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

in addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children our business is subject to other regulations such as the general data protection regulation which becomes effective in the european union in may 2018 which restrict the collection use and retention of person information from all persons failure to comply with those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities 

further we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking information and risk factors that may affect future results 

from time to time including in this annual report on form 10k and in our annual report to shareholders we make “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these “forwardlooking statements” may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods expected technological and product developments the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers the content and timing of planned entertainment releases including motion pictures television and digital content and marketing and promotional efforts research and development activities liquidity and similar matters forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements these statements may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words or phrases such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “expect” “intend” “looking forward” “may” “planned” “potential” “should” “will” and “would” or any variations of words with similar meanings we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forwardlooking statements the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the securities and exchange commission such as on forms 8k 10q and 10k we undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report unless otherwise specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares except for per share amounts 

our strategy involves focusing on franchise and key partner brands and successfully developing those brands across the brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games consumer products storytelling and digital experiences if we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience but this focus also means that our future success 

  

depends disproportionately on our ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money 

in 2017 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 49 of our aggregate net revenues revenues from our key partner brands including disney princess and disney frozen marvel star wars dreamworks’ trolls beyblade and yokai watch constituted 24 of our aggregate net revenues in 2017 together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues if we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands such as current emerging brands and elevate them to franchise brand status over time there is no guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully as an example of this process in february 2018 we elevated baby alive to franchise brand status and moved littlest pet shop which we are in the process of reinventing and which requires a different developmental approach at this point out of franchise brands and into emerging brands 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual children’s and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our children’s and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

   

  

  

  

 storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital content and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties such as motion picture studios with whom we work heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

in 2017 we developed and marketed significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of disney’s beauty and the beast marvel’s guardians of the galaxy vol 2 spiderman homecoming thorragnorok and star wars the last jedi for 2018 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of a number of properties including black panther avengers infinity wars solo a star wars story and antman and the wasp those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures other key partner product lines we are offering such as beyblade and yokaiwatch depend on television support by our partners for their successes similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves such as transformers my little pony and bumblebee if those motion pictures television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will fall as an example in the fourth quarter of 2017 our sales of products related to star wars the last jedi were significantly below our expectations and that was a factor that caused us to miss our revenue expectations for that quarter 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not to develop such entertainment 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media we produce or for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital content or other media we produce or for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our or our partners’ media efforts and related product offerings fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

under the relationship we entered with paramount in october 2017 we plan to play a bigger role in the production and financing of motion pictures based on our properties that has the advantage of giving us more input to what properties are developed into motion pictures and when and can allow us to earn a greater return from successful films but it also increases the money we will directly spend on film production and puts that 

  

investment at risk if our motion pictures are not as successful as we anticipate they will be or if we are not able to produce and distribute films according to the schedule we have planned our financial performance will be negatively impacted 

discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed both domestically and internationally allspark animation and allspark pictures releases and backflip studio’s digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios allspark animation allspark pictures and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2017 we spent 480 million for television programming and film projects being developed by hasbro studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable or higher levels in 2018 and future years 

at december 31 2017 2380 million or 45 of our total assets represented our investments in the discovery family channel if the discovery family channel is not successful our investments may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business further ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to 

  

consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the us dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control during 2015 and 2016 certain key currencies such as the euro russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings depreciation in key currencies during 2018 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

as an example of these risks our revenues and profitability for 2017 were negatively impacted by economic downturns and resulting lower sales of our products in the united kingdom and in brazil the economic downturn in the united kingdom was partly caused by uncertainly around brexit if these markets or other significant markets experience economic difficulties in 2018 it can harm our business and financial results 

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future including eastern europe latin america africa and asia in 2017 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different 

  

global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars as well as disney princess and disney frozen these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel and star wars licenses have been highly significant to our business in 2016 we began sales of products based on the disney princess and disney frozen properties which contributed significantly to our performance if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques further ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers as a result customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that 

  

we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 19 9 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 61 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition as an example of this the bankruptcy filing by toys “r” us in the us and canada in september 2017 and associated reductions in inventory taken by toys “r” us for the holiday season as well as the inability of toys “r” us to pay certain outstanding receivables significantly impacted our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 we expect the ongoing financial situation with toys “r” us including its difficulties in the united kingdom will negatively impact our sales in 2018 with the greatest amount of that impact likely to be in the first half of 2018 and potentially for additional periods based on the level of store closures and how much the sales lost through toys “r” us are picked up by other retail and ecommerce channels 

customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology integrating digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers to continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth we must offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products this is another key to our strategy complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we can face increased risk of not achieving sales 

  

sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 31 2017 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 43 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers primarily located in the far east to produce most of our products these international sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets  are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment 

  

products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products in 2017 our business was negatively impacted by weaker economic conditions in the united kingdom and brazil two of our significant markets economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess disney frozen trolls yokaiwatch or beyblade and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 31 2017 we had 815 million of prepaid royalties 314 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 501 million of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 31 2017 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 2796 million acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

with the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015 all of our products are now manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external 

  

sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slowdowns product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs border adjustment taxes trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involved substantial changes in how we develop and market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail with a focus on understanding consumer insights rapidly identifying and understanding social media trends understanding popular gaming mechanics and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy involves making fundamental changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

  

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities while reducing our workforce in other areas over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets have required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 31 2017 we had 2174 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 1000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

  

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020 which provides for a 1000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 31 2017 we had 17099 million of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world the collection or personally identifiable information from anyone including adults is under increasing regulation in many markets and in may of 2018 the general data protection regulation will become effective in the european union while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our 

  

products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business and that is likely to continue in the future acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies or other synergies in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or to grow our business 

in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyber attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct 

  

our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 including the requirement for the company to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years the tax act also established new tax laws that will affect 2018 and future years including but not limited to i reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent ii generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iii requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations iv creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and v imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation the tax act requires complex computations to be performed significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced by the company the us treasury department the internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered with a possible retroactive effect which is different from our interpretation as we complete our analysis of the tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties at december 31 2017 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of 894 million while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

  

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually at december 31 2017 5731 million or 108 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations while we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the company’s annual review for impairment the company recognized an impairment charge of 329 million related to backflip studios reducing the related goodwill to 863 million in the future should backflip studios not achieve its profitability and growth targets including anticipated game releases in 2018 and beyond the carrying value may become further impaired resulting in additional impairment charges

other assets decreased 22 in 2017 compared to 2016 lower balances in 2017 relate primarily to reduced deferred tax asset balances as a result of the decrease in the us corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 as provided by the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 in addition other assets decreased from declines in the value of longterm foreign exchange contracts payments received from cartamundi in relation to a longterm note receivable related to the sale of the company’s manufacturing operations in august 2015 and lower longterm royalty advances these decreases were partially offset by higher capitalized movie and television production costs net of related production rebates in 2017 other assets increased approximately 5 in 2016 compared to 2015 increases in deferred taxes foreign exchange contracts and other receivables were partially offset by decreases in royalty advances and a payment reducing amounts due from cartamundi 

accounts payable and accrued liabilities were essentially flat in 2017 compared to 2016 increases included a tax withholding on the multiyear stock award agreement earned by the company’s ceo at december 31 2017 see note 13 “stock options other stock awards and warrants” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this 10k for further discussion higher accrued dividends due to a higher dividend rate announced for 2018 and increased accounts payable balances due to timing of payments in 2017 and the company’s focus on improving payable terms these increases were offset by lower incentive compensation accruals and other miscellaneous accruals in 2017 accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately 22 in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase was primarily due to increased accounts payable due to timing of payments higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting a strong entertainment lineup and utilization of guarantee payments in 2016 compared to 2015 as well as higher accrued income taxes due to higher fourth quarter earnings higher accrued advertising due to lower levels of advertising in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased foreign exchange currency liability related to certain strengthening foreign currencies in 2016 

  

other liabilities increased 32 in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase is primarily due to the 1813 million estimated repatriation tax liability which is net of certain foreign tax credits this increase is partially offset by a decline of 530 million in the funded status of the company’s pension plan liability primarily due to a 500 million contribution in 2017 as well as a decrease in the longterm tax receivable agreement with discovery due to the us federal tax rate reduction that will begin in 2018 as discussed above other liabilities decreased 4 in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease is primarily due to a 62 million contribution made to the company’s us pension plan in 2016 partially offset by an increase in the pension liability reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions primarily lower discount rates and an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions

sources and uses of cash 

the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increases during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year during 2017 2016 and 2015 the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit to fund its working capital 

the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program the “program” under the program at the request of the company and subject to market conditions the banks may either purchase from the company or arrange for the sale by the company of unsecured commercial paper notes the company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of 10000 million increased from 7000 million in during the fourth quarter of 2016 the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par or alternatively sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis the interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance borrowings under the program are supported by the company’s 10000 million revolving credit agreement at december 31 2017 the company had 1375 million in borrowings outstanding related to the program 

the company has a revolving credit agreement the “agreement” which provides the company with a 10000 million committed borrowing facility the agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility including with respect to liens mergers and incurrence of indebtedness prior to september 2017 the agreement provided for a 7000 million revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2017 and pursuant to the agreement the company proposed and the lenders agreed to increase the committed borrowing facility from 7000 million to 10000 million the company was in compliance with all covenants in the agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2017 however letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2017 were approximately 11 million amounts available and unused under the committed line at december 31 2017 were approximately 8614 million inclusive of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program the company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks of which approximately 533 million was utilized at december 31 2017 of the amount utilized under or supported by the uncommitted lines approximately 175 million and 358 million represent outstanding shortterm borrowings and letters of credit respectively

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include recoverability of goodwill and income taxes 

recoverability of goodwill 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists 

  

performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4868 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip and the company’s entertainment reporting unit based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative and quantitative assessments the company concluded that there was no impairment of the goodwill during 2017 further discussion of the company’s quantitative assessment of backflip goodwill is discussed below 

as of december 27 2015 the company had 1191 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit the company’s strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflip’s dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date had been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit at that time the company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment related to backflip during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the company’s annual review for impairment we completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the backflip reporting unit prior to the fourth quarter of 2016 there were no triggering events that would have required the company to complete an impairment test our evaluation of the 2016 year performance of the backflip reporting unit was dependent in large part on the performance of launches that took place during the fourth quarter of 2016 additionally during the fourth quarter of 2016 we revised our expectations regarding the timing of future launches the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach discounted cash flows serve as the primary basis for the income approach the company utilized forecasted cash flows for the backflip reporting unit that included assumptions including but not limited to expected revenues to be realized based on planned future mobile game releases expected ebitda margins derived in part based on expected future royalty costs advertising and marketing costs development costs and overhead costs and expected future tax rates the cash flows beyond the forecast period were estimated using a terminal value growth rate of 3 to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 14 was utilized representing the reporting unit’s estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the step one impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the backflip reporting unit was below its carrying value and therefore impairment was indicated because indicators of impairment existed the company commenced the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for the backflip reporting unit which was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis the company assigned the fair value of the backflip reporting unit as calculated under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis to all the assets and liabilities including identifiable intangibles assets of that reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the backflip reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities based on this assessment the company recorded an impairment charge of 329 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company performed the annual quantitative twostep impairment test with respect to backflip based on the results of the impairment test the company concluded that there was no impairment in 2017 as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including the anticipated game releases in 2018 and beyond or if industry discount rates significantly increase the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

  

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit in addition on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 including the requirement for the company to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years the tax act also established new tax laws that will affect 2018 including but not limited to i reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent ii generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iii requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations iv creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and v imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

the tax act requires complex computations to be performed significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered with a possible retroactive effect which is different from our interpretation as we complete our analysis of the tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce products under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 17099 million in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2017 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 31 2017 are as follows 

 

   

  as discussed above the tax act requires the company to pay a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings estimated to be 2716 million as of december 31 2017 the company expects to utilize 903 million of existing tax credits to reduce the 2716 million us federal tax liability which will result in 1813 million to be paid over eight years the timing and ultimate amount of payment is unknown at this time see note 22 “subsequent event” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on additional tax guidance that will change this liability 

theatrical and other contingencies 

the table above also excludes 500 million in guaranteed royalties related to the company’s license agreement related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of a new star wars theatrical release in 2018 

the company and saban brands llc “saban” have entered a license agreement under which saban granted to the company the right to develop market and sell a range of products based upon saban’s power rangers property for sale to the public beginning in the spring of 2019 in connection with that license agreement saban properties llc “saban properties” an affiliate of saban and the company entered into an agreement that provides each of saban properties and the company with a right to initiate the company’s purchase of saban properties’ rights in the power rangers property during designated periods in the future which periods begin in 2022 if either party initiates a sale process the company will pay saban properties a purchase price determined by a fair market value computation specified in the agreement with the purchase price subject to specified floors depending on which party initiates the process the table above does not include any amount attributable to the exercise of this right as there is no guarantee the right will be exercised by either party and if it is exercised the amount of the purchase price will be determinable only at the time of exercise 

other expected future payments 

from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments as such these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below 

 

  

 the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

  

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 957 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 31 2017 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 109 million of which 33 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 89 million are recorded in other assets and 142 million are recorded in accrued liabilities and 89 million are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 31 2017 are deferred losses of 158 million net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 31 2017 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 17099 million of this longterm debt 6000 million represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 3000 million of 315 notes due 2021 and 3000 million of 510 notes due 2044 prior to the may 2014 debt issuance the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 5000 million to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2017 are deferred losses net of tax of 170 million related to these derivatives 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom “uk” voted in a referendum to leave the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit the uk government triggered the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uk’s exit and future relationship with the eu on march 29 2017 the terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the uk government has confirmed its intention to remove the uk from the eu single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from the eu an additional twoyear transitional period to 2021 has been proposed the brexit vote resulted in a weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets notably the euro these fluctuations initially affected our financial results although the impact was partially mitigated by our hedging strategy sterling has strengthened in recent months due to a weaker us dollar our revenues in europe are predominantly denominated in local currency hasbro will continue to closely monitor the brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets taking appropriate actions to support its long term strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2017 and 41 and 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2017 approximately 65 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally 

  

maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2017 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

we are a global play and entertainment company committed to creating the world’s best play experiences we strive to do this through deep consumer engagement and the application of consumer insights the use of immersive storytelling to build our brands product innovation and development of global business reach we apply these principles to leverage our beloved owned and controlled brands including littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers as well as the licensed brands of our strategic partners from toys and games to content development including television programming motion pictures digital gaming and a comprehensive consumer products licensing program hasbro fulfills the fundamental need for play and connection for children and families around the world the company’s whollyowned hasbro studios and its film label allspark pictures create branddriven storytelling across mediums including television film digital and more these elements are executed globally within the construct of our strategic plan the brand blueprint at the center of which our brands reside using this blueprint we innovate new brands and reimagine reinvent and reignite our owned and controlled brands through toy and game innovation immersive entertainment offerings including television programming and motion pictures and a broad range of consumer products ranging from traditional to digital all informed by storytelling and consumer insights 

brand architecture 

hasbro organizes its owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within the brand architecture with a focus on the following categories franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands implementation of the brand architecture has allowed us to leverage existing brand competencies outside the confines of our traditional product categories creating significant growth opportunities in our brands 

franchise brands are hasbro’s most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm our seven franchise brands are littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers as reported net revenues from franchise brands grew 2 in 2016 compared to a decline of 2 in 2015 and growth of 31 in 2014 in 2016 2015 and 2014 franchise brands were 46 52 and 55 of total net revenues respectively 

  

partner brands include those licensed brands for which hasbro develops toy and game products significant partner brands include marvel including spiderman and the avengers star wars disney princess and disney frozen disney‘s descendants dreamworks’ trolls and sesame street 2016 marked the first year of our license agreement with the walt disney company “disney” to market disney princess and disney frozen small and fashion doll product lines partner brands marvel star wars disney’s descendants disney princess and disney frozen are all owned by disney in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 jurassic world was a significant partner brand however beginning in july 2017 the company will no longer have the rights to produce products under this brand 

in 2016 hasbro sold product lines supported by the following theatrical releases from our partners captain america civil war in may 2016 dreamworks’ trolls and moana in november 2016 and rogue one a star wars story in december 2016 in 2015 hasbro sold product supported by three major motion picture releases by our partners the avengers age of ultron jurassic world and star wars the force awakens in 2017 we expect to sell products related to several theatrical releases including disney’s beauty and the beast in march and star wars the last jedi in december marvel’s guardians of the galaxy vol 2 in may spiderman homecoming in july and thor ragnarok in november and films featuring our brands transformers the last knight in june and my little pony the movie  in october aside from these major brand categories we continue to seek growth opportunities by imagining inventing and igniting new or archived brands and by offering immersive entertainment experiences 

hasbro continues to revolutionize traditional game play through its strong portfolio of gaming brands digital integration and the introduction of new gaming brands and play experiences hasbro gaming includes pie face connect 4 elefun  friends jenga the game of life operation scrabble trivial pursuit and twister in addition hasbro’s games portfolio also includes many other wellknown game brands games offerings include face to face trading card and digital game experiences played as board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card and roleplaying games 

emerging brands are those owned or controlled hasbro brands which have not achieved franchise brand status but many of which the company believes have the potential to do so over time with investment and further development these include brands such as baby alive furby furreal friends playskool and playskool heroes they also include new brands being developed by the company such as hanazuki also included in this category are other brands not captured in our other three categories 

storytelling and other entertainment initiatives 

our brand blueprint focuses on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several outlets including television motion pictures and digital gaming 

as part of our brand blueprint we seek to build our brands through entertainmentbased storytelling hasbro studios llc “hasbro studios” is our whollyowned production studio which is responsible for branddriven storytelling across mediums including the development and global distribution of television programming primarily based on our brands this programming currently airs in markets throughout the world domestically hasbro studios primarily distributes programming to discovery family channel the “network” which is a joint venture between discovery communications inc “discovery” and ourselves which operates a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming beginning in 2015 hasbro studios began distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network internationally hasbro studios distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks hasbro studios also distributes programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix and itunes in 2016 hasbro acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland in addition to working on a variety of projects for hasbro studios and allspark pictures boulder media plans to continue to produce nonhasbro content under the boulder name 

during 2014 we formed allspark pictures hasbro’s film label which is producing both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands the company’s storytelling initiatives support its strategy of growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages accessible anytime in many forms and formats in october 2015 allspark pictures released jem and the holograms  in october 2016 allspark pictures released ouija origin of evil  in october 2017 allspark pictures expects to release my little pony the movie  

in addition to film and television initiatives hasbro understands the importance of digital content in gaming media and integrating our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which 

  

extend storylines and enhance play as of december 2016 we owned a 70 majority stake in backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer and in january 2017 we increased our ownership to 100 while certain of our trademarks characters and other property rights are licensed by third parties in connection with digital gaming we anticipate increasingly leveraging and applying backflip’s digital gaming expertise to hasbro brands in 2017 and beyond 

as we seek to grow our business in entertainment licensing and digital gaming we will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios boulder media the network and backflip which may allow us to build out our competencies around the brand blueprint such as in storytelling and digital complement our current product offerings allow us entry into an area which is adjacent or complementary to our toy and game business allow us to add to our brand portfolio or allow us to further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats 

product categories 

through 2016 we marketed our brands under the following primary product categories 1 boys 2 games 3 girls and 4 preschool toys beginning in 2017 we will be organizing categories around our brand architecture as described above 

boys franchise brands in our boys’ category include the nerf action sports products and transformers action figures and accessories the transformers brand which has been supported by the four major successful theatrical releases over the past decade in combination with animated television program developed by hasbro studios transformers robots in disguise has become a hallmark example of how successful our brand blueprint can be when properly executed across all mediums  in addition to these franchise brands the boys’ category also includes super soaker water blasters and action figures and accessories another significant portion of our boys’ category includes licensed product lines based on popular movie television and comic book characters such as marvel and star wars in addition to marketing and developing traditional action figures and accessories for these entertainment brands the company also develops and markets products designed for fans which has been a key component of the success of the transformers star wars and marvel brands 

games over the years we have established a diverse portfolio of wellknown games brands through innovation invention and acquisition our franchise brands magic the gathering and monopoly headline our portfolio and are accompanied by our other gaming brands including connect 4 elefun  friends game of life jenga operation scrabble trivial pursuit twister the 2015 introduction of pie face and the 2016 introduction of speak out to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider brands which may capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for facetoface board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card role playing and other game play including the launch of new play patterns 

girls our girls’ category not only includes traditional girls’ toys but also provides a variety of contemporary and engaging play experiences girls’ franchise brands include littlest pet shop my little pony nerf rebelle and playdoh doh vinci while girls’ challenger brands include baby alive furby and furreal friends franchise brands littlest pet shop and my little pony are each supported by animated television programming developed by hasbro studios and in 2017 my little pony will also be supported by a motion picture expected to be released in october by allspark pictures in addition to hasbro franchise and emerging brands we also have licenses to develop certain product lines based on popular television and film brands including disney’s descendants disney princess disney frozen and dreamworks’ trolls our disney princess and disney frozen product lines were introduced at retail in january 2016 lastly hasbro continues to grow and promote existing brands by leveraging their strengths across other toy categories our nerf rebelle and playdoh doh vinci product lines reflect this strategy 

preschool our preschool category encompasses a range of products for infants and preschoolers in various stages of development in the preschool category we are focused on our franchise brands and storyled initiatives where we believe we can differentiate our offerings and deliver higher profitability franchise brand offerings in the preschool category include my little pony transformers and playdoh including modeling compound and playsets our offerings also include preschool product lines based on those aforementioned licensed entertainment properties including marvel and star wars in recent years we have introduced preschool product lines which complement our girls and boys product lines generally these product lines fall within our playskool hereos and playskool friends brands and include my little pony transformers rescue bots marvel super hero adventures and star wars galactic heroes in addition to playskool heroes and playskool friends our playskool brand also includes wellknown core products 

  

such as mr potato head sit ‘n spin and gloworm along with a line of infant toys including step start walk’ n ride and elefun busy ball popper 

given the evolution of our business with a focus on brands rather than individual products within a brand as well as the development of our brands and our partners’ brands across the brand blueprint into products and entertainment that are enjoyed by girls and boys beginning in 2017 we will report our revenues by brand portfolio franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands as those portfolios were described at the beginning of this section at that time we will cease providing a revenue breakdown by the historical categories boys games girls and preschool 

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries 

in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” and during 2016 we opened an office in argentina while in 2015 we opened offices in south africa and thailand net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2016 in 2016 net revenues from emerging markets increased 9 2015 net revenues in emerging markets declined 9 primarily due to the foreign currency environment while in 2014 emerging market net revenues grew 20 the strengthening of the us dollar had a negative impact on the international segment during 2016 although not as impactful as that seen in 2015 the negative impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues for 2016 2015 and 2014 was 584 million 3794 million and 877 million respectively financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations 

our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal 

  

computers and video game consoles based on those brands through backflip our mobile game developer we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including dragonvale and dragonvale world games through backflip we intend to continue focusing on our existing game titles and to launch new games including further offerings based on hasbro brands for example in 2016 backflip released transformers earth wars to further extend our brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft scopely and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv “cartamundi” on august 31 2015 cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us in their two facilities under a multiyear manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2016 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for 33 of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2017 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2016 and in prior years 

  

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2016 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

product development and royalties 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred expenses of 2664 million 2429 million and 2226 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred 4095 million 3792 million and 3053 million respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2016 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 41 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation who represented 18 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 62 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

  

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred 4689 million 4094 million and 4203 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2016 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multiyear manufacturing agreement 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2017 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions tariffs border adjustment taxes or other measures by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other countries where we manufacture products or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china or other countries where we manufacture products such as higher labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured and imported into other markets 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other children’s and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

  

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and play entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as “children getting older younger” but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 25 2016 we employed approximately 5400 persons worldwide approximately 2600 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

from time to time including in this annual report on form 10k and in our annual report to shareholders we make “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these “forwardlooking statements” may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods including with respect to our planned cost savings initiatives expected technological and product developments the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers the content and timing of planned entertainment releases including motion pictures television and digital content and marketing and promotional efforts research and development activities liquidity and similar matters forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements these statements may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words or phrases such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “expect” “intend” 

  

“looking forward” “may” “planned” “potential” “should” “will” and “would” or any variations of words with similar meanings we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forwardlooking statements the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the securities and exchange commission such as on forms 8k 10q and 10k we undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report unless otherwise specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares except for per share amounts 

our strategy involves focusing on franchise and key partner brands and successfully developing those brands across the brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games consumer products storytelling and digital experiences if we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience but this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money 

in 2016 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 46 of our aggregate net revenues revenues from our key partner brands including disney princess and disney frozen marvel star wars dreamworks’ trolls and yokai watch constituted 28 of our aggregate net revenues in 2016 together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues if we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future and grow sales of products based on those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands such as current emerging brands and elevate them to franchise brand status over time there is no guarantee that we will be able to do this 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families or to maintain the popularity of successful products 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual children’s and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our children’s and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal 

  

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital content and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties such as motion picture studios with whom we work heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

for 2017 we are developing and marketing product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by our key partners of disney’s beauty and the beast marvel’s guardians of the galaxy vol 2 spiderman homecoming  thorragnorok and star wars the last jedi  those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures other key partner product lines we are offering such as yokai watch depend on television support by our partners for their successes similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves such as transformers and my little pony if those motion pictures television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate the number of products we sell may decrease and harm our business 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts and the fact that our third party partners may decide not to develop such entertainment 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital content or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by 

  

consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally and backflip studio’s digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2016 we spent 487 million for television programming and film projects being developed by hasbro studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable levels in 2017 and future years 

at december 25 2016 2424 million or 48 of our total assets represented our investment in the discovery family channel if the discovery family channel is not successful our investments may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are 

  

developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different markets with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control late in 2014 and throughout 2015 certain key currencies such as the euro british pound sterling russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the us dollar also in 2016 certain of these key currencies depreciated against the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings depreciation in key currencies during 2017 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future including eastern europe latin america and asia in 2016 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

   

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars as well as disney princess and disney frozen these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel and star wars licenses have been highly significant to our business in 2016 we began sales of products based on disney princess and disney frozen which contributed significantly to our performance if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature 

  

of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 25 2016 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 18 9 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 41 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 62 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology integrating digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers to continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth we must offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products this is another key to our strategy complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to sell enough of these advanced products at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a result we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 25 2016 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 44 of our total 

  

consolidated net revenues we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located in the far east to produce most of our products these international sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales increase our costs or otherwise damage our business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 on june 23 rd 2016 the united kingdom “uk” voted in a referendum to leave the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit the uk government has stated it will begin the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uk’s exit and future relationship with the eu by april 2017 the terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the uk government has confirmed its intention to remove the uk from the eu single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from within the eu the brexit vote resulted in a weakening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets notably the euro these fluctuations have adversely affected our final results for 2016 although the impact has been partially mitigated by our hedging strategy our revenues in europe are predominately denominated in local currency hasbro will continue to closely monitor the brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets but changes in foreign exchange rates and other potential regulations and increased costs associated with brexit may harm our sales and the profitability of our business in the uk and the eu 

because of the importance of international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

  

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess disney frozen dreamworks’ trolls yokai watch or beyblade related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 25 2016 we had 1028 million of prepaid royalties 341 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 687 million of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 25 2016 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 3557 million acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

  

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

with the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015 all of our products are now manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slowdowns product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business 

further the imposition of tariffs quotas border adjustment taxes such as is currently being discussed in the united states trade sanctions or other protectionist regulations or economic penalties by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from china or other foreign countries or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other foreign countries in which we operate could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe decrease our sales of such products andor decrease our profitability and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow over the longterm our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on understanding consumer insights and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming 

  

opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities while reducing our workforce in other areas over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets have required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 25 2016 we had 2459 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions 

  

and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 7000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020 which provides for a 7000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 25 2016 we had 15599 million of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding including the current portion if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future 

  

complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business and that is likely to continue in the future acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint including in storytelling and digital media in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our family play and entertainment offerings opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies or other synergies in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products develop our competencies or to grow our business 

in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products entertainment or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or 

  

tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates unanticipated changes in our tax rate could impact our results of operations in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties at december 25 2016 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of 844 million while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 25 2016 5706 million or 112 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the company’s annual review for impairment the company recognized an impairment charge of 329 million or 012 per diluted share related to our backflip reporting unit reducing goodwill to 863 million in the future should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including anticipated game releases in 2017 and beyond the carrying value may become further impaired resulting in additional impairment charges

boys the boys’ category grew 4 in 2016 compared to 2015 higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and the introduction of partner brand yokai watch were partially offset by lower net revenues from partner brands jurassic world and marvel and franchise brand transformers products 

within the boys’ category there are a number of entertainmentbased brands which from year to year may be supported by major theatrical releases as such boys’ category net revenues by brand fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on movie popularity release dates and related product line offerings and success in 2016 two partner brands in the boys’ category were supported by major theatrical releases – star wars was supported by star wars the force awakens released during the fourth quarter of 2015 along with the december 2016 release rogue one a star wars story and marvel despite lower overall brand revenues in 2016 was supported by the may 2016 release of captain america civil war  these benefits were partially offset by lower 2016 net revenues from partner brand jurassic world which was supported in 2015 with the june theatrical release of jurassic world  subsequent to june 2017 the company will no longer have the rights to sell toy products under the jurassic world brand 

games the games category grew 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 higher net revenues resulted from franchise brand magic the gathering products as well as from other games brands including but not limited to pie face duel masters simon bopit yahtzee trivial pursuit dungeons  dragons and clue products as well as the successful 2016 launch of the speakout game these higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand monopoly products and various other games brands including but not limited to trouble twister elefun  friends operation and scrabble products

preschool the preschool category declined 1 in 2016 compared to 2015 higher net revenues from franchise brand playdoh products were more than offset by lower revenues from the company’s core playskool products jurassic world sesame street transformers marvel star wars and my little pony products

games the games category grew 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 higher net revenues resulted from franchise brands magic the gathering and monopoly as well as from other games brands including but not limited to pie face duel masters dungeons  dragons life ouija risk rubiks trouble and yahtzee these higher net revenues were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from various other games brands including but not limited to elefun  friends jenga and taboo 

girls the girls’ category declined 22 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to expected lower net revenues from furby products as well as declines in my little pony nerf rebelle and littlest pet shop core my little pony revenues increased but were however more than offset by lower net revenues from the my little 

  

pony equestria girls products these declines were only partially offset by the first full year of net revenues from the playdoh doh vinci brand the 2015 introduction of the disney’s descendants product line and initial shipments of disney princess and disney frozen products which became available at retail in january 2016 

preschool the preschool category grew 17 in 2015 compared to 2014 higher net revenues from franchise brand playdoh and partner brands jurassic world and star wars were only partially offset by lower revenues from the company’s core playskool product line consistent with the boys’ category preschool category net revenues from partner brands benefited from the strong theatrical lineup discussed above 

given the evolution of our business with a focus on brands rather than individual products within a brand as well as the development of our brands and our partners’ brands across the brand blueprint into products and entertainment that are enjoyed by girls and boys beginning in 2017 we will report our revenues by brand portfolio franchise brands partner brands hasbro gaming and emerging brands at that time we will cease providing a revenue breakdown by the historical categories boys games girls and preschool revenue by brand portfolio in millions for 2016 2015 and 2014 is as follows 

 

 hasbro’s total gaming category including the hasbro gaming portfolio as reported above and all other gaming revenue most notably magic the gathering and monopoly which are in the franchise brands portfolio totaled 13871 million 12765 and 12598 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the company believes that its gaming portfolio is a competitive differentiator and views it in its entirety

other assets increased 5 in 2016 compared to 2015 increases in deferred taxes foreign exchange contracts and other receivables were partially offset by decreases in royalty advances and a payment reducing amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the company’s manufacturing operations in 2015 other assets increased approximately 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase primarily reflects longterm amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the company’s manufacturing operations as well as higher longterm receivables related to multiyear television distribution agreements these increases were partially offset by lower longterm royalty advances 

accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 22 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased accounts payable due to timing of payments higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2016’s stronger entertainment lineup and utilization of guarantee payments compared to 2015 as well as higher accrued income taxes due to higher fourth quarter earnings higher accrued advertising due to lower levels of advertising in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased foreign exchange currency liability related to certain strengthening foreign currencies in 2016 accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately 10 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2015’s stronger entertainment lineup compared to 2014 as well as higher accrued performancebased compensation reflecting the company’s overall performance these increases were partially offset by lower accrued advertising 

other liabilities decreased 4 in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease is primarily due to a 62 million contribution made to the company’s us pension plan in 2016 partially offset by an increase in the pension liability reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions primarily lower discount rates and an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions other liabilities increased 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase primarily reflects higher uncertain tax positions partially offset by a reduction in pension liabilities reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions primarily due to higher discount rates

the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year during 2016 2015 and 2014 the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions 

  

affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

sales allowances 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2016 there were no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy game and other consumer product licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a film or television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the us which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 25 2016 we have 828 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2017 through 2019 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2016 and 2014 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the 

  

company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists 

performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4736 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill excluding backflip during 2016 

as of december 27 2015 the company had 1191 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit the company’s strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflip’s dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date had been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit at that time the company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment related to backflip during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the company’s annual review for impairment we completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the backflip reporting unit prior to the fourth quarter of 2016 there were no triggering events that would have required the company to complete an impairment test our evaluation of the current year performance of the backflip reporting unit was dependent in large part on the performance of launches that took place during the fourth quarter additionally during the fourth quarter we revised our expectations regarding the timing of future launches the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value which was calculated based on the income approach discounted cash flows serve as the primary basis for the income approach the company utilized forecasted cash flows for the backflip reporting unit that included assumptions including but not limited to expected revenues to be realized based on planned future mobile game releases expected ebitda margins derived in part based on expected future royalty costs advertising and marketing costs development costs and overhead costs and expected future tax rates the cash flows beyond the forecast period were estimated using a terminal value growth rate of 3 to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach a discount rate of 14 was utilized representing the reporting unit’s estimated weightedaverage cost of capital based on the results of the step one impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the backflip reporting unit was below its carrying value and therefore impairment was indicated because indicators of impairment existed the company commenced the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for the backflip reporting unit which was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis the company assigned the fair value of the backflip reporting unit as calculated under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis to all the assets and liabilities including identifiable intangibles assets of that reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the backflip reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities based on this assessment the company recorded an impairment charge of 329 million should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including the anticipated game releases in 2017 and beyond or if industry discount rates significantly increase the carrying value of this reporting unit may become further impaired at december 25 2016 there is 863 million of remaining goodwill related to the backflip reporting unit 

during the third quarter of 2016 the company acquired boulder media an animation studio based in dublin ireland based on the company’s analysis goodwill in the amount of 118 million was recorded and is reflected in the entertainment and licensing segment due to the timing of the acquisition in conjunction with the company’s annual impairment review it was concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in 2016 related to boulder media 

the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 757 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective 

  

asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 1702 million at december 25 2016 during 2016 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required if advanced or if not advanced an expense is recorded to accrue the shortfall the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 25 2016 the company had 1028 million of prepaid royalties 341 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 687 million of which are included in other assets 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded us pension plan the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2016 pension expense for the us plans was 675 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2016 pension expense for us plans by approximately 07 million 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2016 pension expense was 458 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately 10 million 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 25 2016 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 1409 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 1205 million at december 27 2015 

  

the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 25 2016 decreased to 422 from 458 used at december 27 2015 a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased the 2016 projected benefit obligation by approximately 118 million pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company’s interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2016 2015 and 2014 the company recorded net benefits of approximately 120 million 40 million and 200 million respectively associated with discrete tax events excluding any potential interest and penalties 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries at december 25 2016 the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 6410 million 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 15599 million in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 25 2016 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 25 2016 are as follows 

 

  

  theatrical contingencies 

the table above excludes up to 400 million in guaranteed royalties related to the company’s license agreement related to marvel as such amounts are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be payable during the next five years the company expects to pay these additional royalties in 2017 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases 

the table above also excludes 1000 million in guaranteed royalties related to the company’s license agreement related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of new star wars theatrical releases in 2017 and beyond 

other expected future payments 

from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments as such these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below 

 

  

  

 the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

  

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 976 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 25 2016 these contracts had net unrealized gains of 765 million of which 367 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 511 million are recorded in other assets and 113 million are recorded in accrued liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 25 2016 are deferred gains of 693 million net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 25 2016 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 15599 million of this longterm debt 6000 million represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 3000 million of 315 notes due 2021 and 3000 million of 510 notes due 2044 prior to the may 2014 debt issuance the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 5000 million to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 25 2016 are deferred losses net of tax of 182 million related to these derivatives 

on june 23 rd 2016 the united kingdom “uk” voted in a referendum to leave the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit the uk government has stated it will begin the formal twoyear period to negotiate the terms of the uk’s exit and future relationship with the eu by april 2017 the terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the uk government has confirmed its intention to remove the uk from the eu single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from the eu the brexit vote resulted in a weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets notably the euro these fluctuations have adversely affected our financial results for 2016 although the impact has been partially mitigated by our hedging strategy our revenues in europe are predominantly denominated in local currency hasbro will continue to closely monitor the brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets taking appropriate actions to support its long term strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 41 of its consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 38 and 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

  

  

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2016 approximately 66 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2016 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

brand architecture 

hasbro organizes owned controlled and licensed intellectual properties within the brand architecture with a focus on the following franchise brands challenger brands mega gaming brands and partner brands implementation of the brand architecture has allowed us to leverage existing brand competencies outside the confines of our traditional product categories creating significant growth opportunities in our brands 

  

franchise brands are hasbro’s most significant owned or controlled properties which we believe have the ability to deliver significant revenues and growth over the longterm our seven franchise brands are littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh and transformers as reported net revenues from franchise brands declined 2 in 2015 but grew 31 and 15 in 2014 and 2013 respectively absent the impact of foreign currency translation in 2015 net revenues from franchise brands grew 7 in 2015 compared to 2014 furthermore in 2015 2014 and 2013 franchise brands were 52 55 and 44 of total net revenues respectively 

challenger brands are those owned or controlled hasbro brands which have not yet achieved franchise brand status but which the company believes have the potential to do so over time with investment and further development challenger brands includes baby alive furby furreal friends kreo playskool and playskool heroes 

hasbro continues to revolutionize traditional game play through its strong portfolio of mega gaming brands digital integration and the introduction of new gaming brands and play experiences mega gaming brands specifically include connect 4 elefun  friends jenga the game of life operation scrabble trivial pursuit and twister however hasbro’s games portfolio also includes many other wellknown game brands games offerings include face to face trading card and digital game experiences played as board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card and roleplaying games

in 2015 hasbro sold product supported by three major motion picture releases by our partners these major motion picture releases comprised the avengers age of ultron jurassic world and star wars the force awakens the financial impact of these major motion picture releases on our results is discussed in detail in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this report in 2016 hasbro expects to sell product lines supported by the following expected theatrical releases from disney captain america civil war in may 2016 moana in november 2016 and rogue one a star wars story in december 2016 we also expect to sell products related to the expected dreamworks animation theatrical release of trolls in the fall of 2016 aside from these major brand categories we continue to seek growth opportunities by imagining inventing and igniting new or archived brands and by offering engaging brandedplay experiences 

storytelling and other entertainment initiatives 

our brand blueprint focuses on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several outlets including television motion pictures and digital media 

as part of our brand blueprint we seek to build our brands through entertainmentbased storytelling hasbro studios llc “hasbro studios” is our whollyowned production studio which is responsible for branddriven storytelling across mediums including the development and global distribution of television programming primarily based on our brands this programming currently airs in markets throughout the world domestically hasbro studios primarily distributes programming to discovery family channel the “network” which is a joint venture between discovery communications inc “discovery” and ourselves which operates a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming beginning in 2015 hasbro studios began distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network internationally hasbro studios distributes to various broadcasters and cable networks lastly hasbro studios distributes programming globally on various digital platforms including netflix and itunes 

during 2014 we formed allspark pictures hasbro’s film label which is producing both animated and live action theatrical releases based on our brands the company’s storytelling initiatives support its strategy of 

  

growing its brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages accessible anytime in many forms and formats in october 2015 allspark pictures released jem and the holograms  in october 2016 allspark pictures expects to release ouija 2 

in addition to film and television initiatives hasbro understands the importance of digital media and digitally integrating our products digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications and websites which extend storylines and enhance play we own a 70 majority stake in backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer while certain of our trademarks characters and other property rights are licensed by third parties in connection with digital gaming we anticipate leveraging and applying backflip’s digital gaming expertise to hasbro brands in 2016 and beyond 

as we seek to grow our business in entertainment licensing and digital gaming we will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios the network and backflip which may complement our current product offerings allow us entry into an area which is adjacent or complementary to our toy and game business or allow us to further develop awareness of our brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience our brands in different forms and formats 

product categories 

we market our brands under the following primary product categories 1 boys 2 games 3 girls and 4 preschool toys 

boys franchise brands in our boys’ category include the nerf action sports products and transformers action figures and accessories the transformers brand which has been supported by the four major successful theatrical releases over the past decade in combination with animated television program developed by hasbro studios transformers robots in disguise has become a hallmark example of how successful our brand blueprint can be when properly executed across all mediums  in addition to these franchise brands the boys’ category also includes super soaker water blasters and gi joe action figures and accessories another significant portion of our boys’ category includes licensed product lines based on popular movie television and comic book characters such as marvel and star wars in 2015 overall results from the boys category benefited from significant product sales related to three major motion picture releases avengers age of ultron star wars the force awakens and jurassic world in addition to marketing and developing traditional action figures and accessories for these entertainment brands the company also develops and markets products designed for collectors which has been a key component of the success of the transformers star wars and marvel brands 

games over the years we have established a diverse portfolio of wellknown games brands through innovation invention and acquisition our franchise brands magic the gathering and monopoly headline our portfolio and are accompanied by our mega gaming brands including connect 4 elefun  friends game of life jenga operation scrabble trivial pursuit and twister to successfully execute our gaming strategy we consider brands which may capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for facetoface board offtheboard digital card electronic trading card role playing and other game play including the launch of new play patterns in the fourth quarter of 2015 net revenues from the games category benefited from the introduction of pie face

continues to grow and promote existing brands by leveraging their strengths across other toy categories our nerf rebelle and playdoh doh vinci product lines reflect this strategy 

preschool our preschool category encompasses a range of products for infants and preschoolers in various stages of development in the preschool category we are focused on our franchise brands and storyled initiatives where we believe we can differentiate our offerings and deliver higher profitability franchise brand offerings in the preschool category include my little pony transformers and playdoh including modeling compound and playsets our offerings also include preschool product lines based on those aforementioned licensed entertainment properties including jurassic world marvel and star wars in recent years we have introduced preschool product lines which complement our girls and boys product lines generally these product lines fall within our playskool hereos and playskool friends brands and include my little pony jurassic world transformers rescue bots marvel super hero adventures and star wars galactic heroes in addition to playskool heroes and playskool friends our playskool brand also includes wellknown core products such as mr potato head sit ‘n spin and gloworm along with a line of infant toys including step start walk’ n ride and elefun busy ball popper 

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and marketing groups to establish a cohesive brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip as well as engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and canada the us and canada segment promotes our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries 

in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to opportunistically expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for us as we believe they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” and during 2015 we opened offices in south africa and thailand net revenues from emerging markets represented 14 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2015 in 2015 net revenues from emerging markets decreased 9 primarily due to a challenging foreign currency environment whereas 2014 and 2013 net revenues in emerging markets grew 20 and 25 respectively the strengthening of 

  

the us dollar had a significant impact on the international segment during 2015 the us dollar strengthened against nearly all of our major selling currencies including the brazilian real euro mexican peso and russian ruble the negative impact from foreign currency translation on international segment net revenues for 2015 and 2014 was 3794 million and 877 million respectively furthermore absent the negative impact of foreign currency net revenues from emerging markets grew approximately 15 financial information with respect to foreign currency risk management is included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

entertainment and licensing our entertainment and licensing segment includes our consumer products licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations 

our consumer products licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands we have a 70 majority ownership in backflip a mobile game developer as we seek to complement the aforementioned outlicensing with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including the dragonvale game backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles particularly dragonvale and to launch new games including game offerings based on hasbro brands to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands the company has digital gaming relationships with electronic arts inc activision ubisoft and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both immersive storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations our global operations segment sources production of our toy and game products through august 2015 the company owned and operated manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produced game products these facilities were sold to cartamundi nv “cartamundi” on august 31 2015 cartamundi will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement sourcing for our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

  

each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings 

our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as such a disproportionate volume of our net revenues are earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season including christmas as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response or justintime inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy as such our business generally earns more revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half in 2015 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters each accounting for 33 of full year net revenues the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2016 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2015 and in prior years 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2015 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

product development and royalties 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our brandedplay and entertainment offerings and requires continued development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development function the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred expenses of 2429 million 2226 million and 2076 million respectively on activities related to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

  

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 3792 million 3053 million and 3389 million respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 638 million related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as costs related to the amendment of the company’s license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

while our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and reinvention our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs the global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver unified brandspecific points of view the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in addition to the global marketing function our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution 

our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who for the most part sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence notwithstanding our thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers customer concentration provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution practices and other reductions in costs of sales and distribution however customer concentration can also create additional risks for our business these risks can create potential detriments to our business resulting from the financial difficulties of our major customers which could lead to reductions in sales or unfavorable changes in our business relationships with one or more of our major customers customer concentration may also decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2015 net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated global net revenues including our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation who represented 16 9 and 9 respectively of consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television and through digital marketing and advertising of our brands products are strategically crosspromoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item but also those complementary products in addition to those advertising initiatives hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel and other major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we also introduce many of our new products to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction we generally showcase certain new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred 4094 million 4203 million and 3981 million respectively in expense related to advertising and promotional programs 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2015 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in two previously owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and 

  

waterford ireland these facilities were owned by the company through august 2015 at which point they were sold to cartamundi who will continue to manufacture game products for us under a manufacturing agreement 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2016 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 

the manufacturing processes of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other children’s and family television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as “children getting older younger” but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family entertainment we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

  

employees 

at december 27 2015 we employed approximately 5000 persons worldwide approximately 2500 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

we are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and key partner brands and development of those brands across the brand blueprint 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets this strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas including storytelling digital content and consumer products developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort time and money our future success is dependent on our ability to continue building our brands across the blueprint 

in 2015 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 52 of our aggregate net revenues our key partner brands including disney marvel and lucasfilm also constitute a significant portion of our overall business in 2015 net revenues from our partner brands constituted 28 of our aggregate net revenues together our franchise and partner brands are critical to our business if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers to the extent required to maintain and grow those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed in addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands successfully executing our brand strategy may also require us to be able to successfully develop other brands such as current challenger brands to franchise brand status there is no guarantee that we will be able to do this 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular 

  

during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual children’s and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our children’s and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to integrate digital and analog play and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness storytelling and brand building 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital products digital shorts dvd releases and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

for 2016 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of captain america civil war moana rogue one a star wars story and trolls  those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures other key partner product lines we are offering such as yokaiwatch depend on television support by our partners for their successes similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves if those motion pictures television shows or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

  

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally and backflip studios’ digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2015 we spent 425 million for television programming and film projects being developed by hasbro studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable levels in 2016 and future years 

at december 27 2015 2429 million or 51 of our total assets represented our investment in discovery family channel if discovery family channel does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels in addition we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories across our business we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low and the increasing importance of digital 

  

media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control late in 2014 and throughout 2015 certain key currencies such as the euro russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our 2014 and 2015 revenues and earnings similar depreciation in key currencies during 2016 may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the 

  

level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

challenging market conditions in certain developed economies such as in australia and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed 

our future success in developed economies is impacted by market conditions for example a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states and other developed economies may harm our business 

many categories within the toy game and family entertainment industries in certain developed economies such as australia and certain western european countries have not grown or in some cases have even declined in certain recent years in addition many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly if at all in the next several years we have substantial business in developed economies and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining to succeed in a market that is stable or declining we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult this will be an additional challenge for the company 

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future including eastern europe latin america and asia in 2015 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

   

  

 because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars each owned by disney these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel and star wars licenses have been highly significant to our business if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license beginning in 2016 our product offerings under licenses with disney will expand to include product offerings based on the disney princess and frozen brands 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our 

  

failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 27 2015 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 16 9 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology integrating digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers to continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth we must offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products this is another key to our strategy complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

costs associated with designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures in order to recoup these higher costs sufficient sales quantities at sufficient prices which reflect those higher costs are necessary but may be constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions meaning we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs additionally designing developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows 

  

different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 27 2015 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 44 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect net revenues from our international segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located in the far east to produce our products these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our international sales sourcing and manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

  

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary brandedplay entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street disney princess frozen  trolls or yokaiwatch related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 27 2015 we had 1244 million of prepaid royalties 475 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 768 million of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 27 2015 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 4264 million acquiring or renewing 

  

licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

with the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015 all of our products are now manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of whom are located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slow downs product regulations andor inspections or other factors prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business further the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these 

  

requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow over the longterm our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on understanding consumer insights and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets has required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses we intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives and through process improvements including in global product development however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret 

  

copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 27 2015 we had 2808 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 7000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020 which provides for a 7000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and 

  

prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 27 2015 we had 15599 million of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in reviewing potential acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings and opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint or other synergies in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown 

  

the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of a 70 interest in backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products or to grow our business in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other processes and transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by 

  

the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or differing interpretations of income tax laws and rules and changes in our geographic operating results may impact our effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various international tax jurisdictions we also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate there is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive or are determined to derive by tax authorities from jurisdictions with differing tax rates unanticipated changes in our tax rate could impact our results of operations in addition we may be subject to tax examinations by federal state and international jurisdictions and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties at december 27 2015 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of 683 million while we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits or results of possible current or future tax examinations may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 27 2015 5927 million or 125 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations included in goodwill is 1191 million related to backflip should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including anticipated game releases in 2016 the carrying value may become impaired

boys the boys’ category grew 20 in 2015 compared to 2014 higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and partner brands jurassic world marvel and star wars were slightly offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand transformers 

within the boys’ category there are a number of entertainmentbased brands which from year to year may be supported by major theatrical releases as such boys’ category net revenues by brand fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on movie popularity release dates and related product line offerings and success in 2015 three partner brands were supported by major theatrical releases — jurassic world was supported by the june 

  

2015 release of jurassic world  marvel was supported by the may 2015 release of avengers age of ultron and star wars was supported by the december 2015 release of star wars the force awakens  these benefits were partially offset by lower 2015 net revenues from franchise brand transformers in a nonmovie year as compared to 2014 with the june theatrical release of transformers age of extinction  

games the games category grew 1 in 2015 compared to 2014 higher net revenues resulted from franchise brands magic the gathering and monopoly as well as from other games brands including but not limited to pie face duel masters dungeons  dragons life ouija risk rubiks trouble and yahtzee these higher net revenues were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from various other games brands including but not limited to elefun  friends jenga and taboo 

girls the girls’ category declined 22 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to expected lower net revenues from furby products as well as declines in my little pony nerf rebelle and littlest pet shop core my little pony revenues increased but were however more than offset by lower net revenues from the my little pony equestria girls products these declines were only partially offset by the first full year of net revenues from the playdoh doh vinci brand the 2015 introduction of the disney’s descendants product line and initial shipments of disney princess and frozen products which became available at retail in january 2016

the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year during 2015 2014 and 2013 the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit 

the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program the “program” under the program at the request of the company and subject to market conditions the banks may either purchase from the company or arrange for the sale by the company of unsecured commercial paper notes the company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of 7000 million the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par or alternatively sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis the interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance borrowings under the program are supported by the company’s 7000 million revolving credit agreement at december 27 2015 the company had 1600 million in borrowings outstanding related to the program

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial 

  

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

sales allowances 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2015 there were no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy game and other consumer product licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a film or television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the us which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 27 2015 we have 755 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2016 through 2018 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then 

  

current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists 

performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 4736 million the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2015 the company has 1191 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit the company’s strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflip’s dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date has been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit the impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings including 2016 releases based on backflip’s dragonvale brand as well as several hasbro brandedgame titles the underlying cash flows are based on longterm financial plans for backflip which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability the company used a discount rate commensurate with the digital gaming industry based on the results of the impairment test the company concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the fair value would have to decline by 20 in order for this asset to be impaired should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets including the anticipated game releases in 2016 or if industry discount rates significantly increase the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired 

the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 757 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the 

  

estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 2051 million at december 27 2015 during 2015 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 27 2015 the company had 1243 million of prepaid royalties 475 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 768 million of which are included in other assets during 2015 there were no significant charges related to this policy 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded us pension plan the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2015 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2015 pension expense for us plans by approximately 07 million 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2015 pension expense was 419 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2015 pension expense by approximately 05 million 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 27 2015 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 1205 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 1240 million at december 28 2014 the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 27 2015 increased to 

  

458 from 419 used at december 28 2014 a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased the 2015 projected benefit obligation by approximately 109 million pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and evaluates its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities as well as the related interest are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company’s interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2014 the company recorded a net benefit of approximately 200 million associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of us and mexico tax examinations as well as certain other us and foreign prior period tax adjustments during 2014 the company paid approximately 650 million to settle tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico the company incurred additional tax expense in 2014 of 69 million related to this settlement 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries at december 27 2015 the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 5480 million 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 15599 million in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 27 2015 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 27 2015 are as follows 

 

  

  theatrical contingencies 

the table above excludes up to 700 million in guaranteed royalties related to the company’s license agreement related to marvel as such amounts are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be payable during the next six years the company expects to pay approximately 400 million of these additional royalties in 2016 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases 

the table above also excludes 1000 million in guaranteed royalties related to the company’s license agreement related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of new star wars theatrical releases in 2017 and beyond 

other expected future payments 

from time to time the company may be party to arrangements contractual or otherwise whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments as such these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below 

 

  

   

  

  

 the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 1246 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 27 2015 these contracts had net unrealized gains of 1064 million of which 730 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 347 million are recorded in other assets 11 million are recorded in accrued liabilities and 02 million are recorded to other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 27 2015 are deferred gains of 987 million net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 27 2015 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 15599 million of this longterm debt 6000 million represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 3000 million of 315 notes due 2021 and 3000 million of 510 notes due 2044 prior to the may 2014 debt issuance the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 5000 million to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 27 2015 are deferred losses net of tax of 194 million related to these derivatives 

  

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 38 and 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 2013 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2015 approximately 66 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2015 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy and game products are primarily developed by crossfunctional teams including members of our global development and global marketing groups which also establish brand direction and assist the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products and also conducts our movie television and digital gaming entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios and backflip our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the company’s strategy focuses on reimagining reinventing and reigniting its existing brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands globally through the development and marketing of innovative toy and game products providing immersive entertainment experiences for our consumers and expansion of our brands into other consumer products through broad licensing programs including digital media and lifestyle products all supported by storytelling and consumer insights the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada 

this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories in the united states and canada the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences including motion pictures and television programming 

international 

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through 

  

distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for hasbro as they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” in 2014 2013 and 2012 net revenues in emerging markets grew 20 25 and 16 respectively from the prior years and represented more than 15 of our total consolidated net revenues in 2014 

entertainment and licensing 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands largely through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands in support of this strategy in 2013 the company acquired a 70 majority ownership in backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer based in boulder colorado as we seek to complement outlicensing of certain of our brands with the development of internal digital gaming resources backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including dragonvale ninjump and paper toss new game brands released during 2014 include dwarven den plundernauts spellfall and seabeard backflip also introduced two game brands under hasbro brands specifically nerfhoops and twister tap in 2015 and beyond backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles particularly dragonvale and to launch new games including more game offerings based on hasbro brands to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands one example of these digital gaming relationships is the company’s agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” under which ea has the rights to develop several of hasbro’s bestselling gaming brands for mobile platforms globally similarly the company has an agreement with activision under which activision offers digital games based on the transformers brand and with ubisoft under which ubisoft offers console games based on monopoly scrabble trivial pursuit and others lastly we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation 

to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we operate a whollyowned studio hasbro studios which produces storytelling across mediums this includes television programming primarily based on our brands which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 40 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates discovery family channel a cable television network in the united states discovery family channel is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in october 2015 the company plans to reignite an archived brand with the expected release of jem and the holograms by hasbro’s own recently established film label allspark pictures in partnership with universal studios in 2014 paramount pictures released the fourth major motion picture based on the transformers brand transformers age of extinction and universal pictures released a second motion picture based on a games brand ouija  in 2013 gi joe retaliation the second major motion picture based on the gi joe brand was released by paramount pictures in may 2012 battleship was released by universal pictures 

  

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide both storytelling and the ability for our consumers to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related home entertainment releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce game products sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed primarily through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2014 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 35 and 30 of full year net revenues respectively 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers generally time their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and 

  

as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2015 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2014 and in prior years 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2014 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit as well as excess proceeds from the 2014 issuance of longterm debt to meet our cash flow requirements 

royalties and product development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our product and entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred expenses of 222556 207591 and 201197 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred 305317 338919 and 302066 respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 63801 related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as the amendment of its license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs this global marketing group works crossfunctionally with the global development function to deliver a unified product and message the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments we also maintain sales and marketing functions in our selling entities which are responsible for local market activities and execution our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores drug stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our 

  

products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while this concentration of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2014 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation represented 16 9 and 8 respectively of consolidated global net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart toys “r” us inc and target accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated global net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television in addition we engage in digital marketing and advertising for our brands generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios produces entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on discovery family channel in the us other major networks internationally and on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes beginning in 2015 hasbro studios will begin distributing certain programming domestically to other outlets including cartoon network we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows including in hong kong and nuremburg germany in 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred 420256 398098 and 422239 respectively in expense related to advertising and promotion programs certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures generally do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other nonentertainment based products 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2014 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from suppliers in the united states and certain other countries 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2015 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or 

  

other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and discovery family channel compete with other children’s television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles have shrunk as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages this has been referred to as “children getting older younger” but may also be referred to as developmental compression as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 28 2014 we employed approximately 5200 persons worldwide approximately 2700 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous 

  

substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

we are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and key partner brands 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on our franchise and partner brands which we view as 

  

having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets in 2014 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 55 of our aggregate net revenues our key partner brands such as disney marvel lucasfilm sesame street and rovio also constitute a significant portion of our overall business together our franchise and partner brands are critical to our business if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers to the extent required to maintain and grow those brands our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual child and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged similarly if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our child and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to combine digital and analog play and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

   

 entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness storytelling and brand building 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital products digital shorts dvd releases and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases both by our partners and our own media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

for 2015 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of avengers  age of ultron  jurassic world and star wars the force awakens  those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures similarly we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves if those motion pictures or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate our revenues and earnings will be reduced 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

discovery family channel our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that discovery family channel will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally and backflip studio’s digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios and backflip studios or other content appearing on discovery family channel and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in discovery family channel such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for discovery family channel during 2014 the company spent 31424 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2015 and future years 

  

at december 28 2014 244587 or 54 of our total assets represented our investment in discovery family channel if discovery family channel does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

the children’s and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailer’s private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not 

  

significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control late in 2014 certain key currencies such as the euro russian ruble and brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the us dollar this depreciation had a significant negative impact on our 2014 revenues and earnings similar depreciation in key currencies during 2015 may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in us dollars 

united states global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

challenging market conditions in certain developed economies such as in the united states canada australia and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed 

our future success in the united states canada australia europe and other developed economies is impacted by market conditions for example a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states and other developed economies may harm our business 

many categories within the toy game and family entertainment industries in the united states canada australia certain western european countries and other developed economies have not grown or in some cases have even declined in recent years in addition many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly if at all in the next several years we have substantial business in developed economies and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining to succeed in a market that is stable or declining we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult this will be an additional challenge for the company 

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets including eastern europe latin america and asia in 2014 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 16 of our net 

  

revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars owned by disney as well as sesame street and rovio these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars sesame street and rovio licenses have been highly significant to our business if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license in 2015 we anticipate offering products based on the disney descendants brand as well and beginning in 2016 we anticipate offering products based on the disney princess and frozen brands 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by 

  

consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 28 2014 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 16 9 and 8 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 59 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which combine digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture margins on some portion of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at 

  

younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products or products that combine digital and analog technology tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs additionally designing developing and producing electronic and digital products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of electronic or digital products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such projects in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 28 2014 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 47 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located in the far east to produce the substantial majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street or rovio related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure 

  

maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 28 2014 we had 230840 of prepaid royalties 132146 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 98694 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 28 2014 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 506000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the substantial majority of our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

we own and operate two manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china although should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings 

factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes slowdowns product regulations andor inspections or other factors during the period leading up to the 2014 holiday season labor disputes had a negative impact on the transportation of many goods coming from the far east to the united states through the port the company utilizes in california to manage the impact of that situation we opted to transport products through a port on the east coast however prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the united states natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china can also have a significant negative impact on our business further the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our 

  

cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow over the longterm our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required from our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets has required changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve 

  

our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses to improve our profitability and competitiveness in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative the objective of this initiative is to reduce our underlying operating costs by an annual gross amount of 100 million by the end of 2015 we intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives workforce reductions facility consolidation and other process improvements however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative 

our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our trademarks and tradenames copyrights patents and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of critical value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources similarly third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position 

we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 28 2014 we had 324528 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 700000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017 which provides for a 700000 committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

  

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 28 2014 we had 1559895 of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act and other privacy laws around the world while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings andor the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of a 70 interest in backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future there is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources which may negatively impact other aspects of our business 

failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including product development management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products financial reporting and various other process transactions we are critically dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses malware and other security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including current and future products and entertainment under development and also contains certain customer consumer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers consumers suppliers partners employees or ourselves or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through 

  

breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers consumers and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 28 2014 593438 or 131 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations

while hasbro believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its owned or controlled brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to selectively enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths and allow the company to offer innovative products based on movie television and other entertainment properties owned by third parties the company’s primary licenses include its agreements with marvel characters bv “marvel” for characters in the marvel universe including spiderman and the avengers lucas licensing ltd “lucas” related to the star wars brand sesame workshop related to the sesame street characters and rovio entertainment ltd related to the angry birds brand both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company “disney” in 2013 the company and disney amended both the marvel and lucas agreements which extended the term of the license for marvel characters through 2020 and provides additional guaranteed royalty payments with respect to both marvel and star wars products in anticipation of expected future motion pictures and other related entertainment through 2020 in september 2014 the company’s strategic merchandising relationship with disney expanded to include product offerings specifically small and fashion dolls based on the popular disney princess and frozen brands commencing in 2016 also in 2014 the company entered into an agreement with disney allowing the company to offer certain products based on the disney descendants brand beginning in 2015 in addition to offering products based on licensed entertainment properties the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors 

sales of marvel products are dependent upon the number and type of theatrical releases in any given year in 2014 the company had sales of marvel products related to three theatrical releases captain america the winter soldier  the amazing spiderman and guardians of the galaxy  in 2013 the company only had sales of marvel products related to the may release of iron man 3 however these sales were not as significant as those sales of products in 2012 related to the theatrical releases of marvel’s the avengers and the amazing spiderman during 2015 the company will market products related to two planned theatrical motion picture releases based on marvel characters including avengers age of ultron furthermore 2015 sales of star wars products will be supported by the highly anticipated release of star wars the force awakens from lucasfilm ltd as well as jurassic world from universal pictures 

the company also seeks to build allencompassing brand experiences and drive productrelated revenues by increasing the visibility of its brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming since 2007 the company has had a number of motion pictures based on its brands released by major motion picture studios including four motion pictures based on its transformers brand two motion pictures based on its gi joe brand and two motion pictures based on its gaming brands battleship and ouija the company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures the company has also released animated movies based on its my little pony and my little pony equestria girls brands in october 2015 the company plans to reignite an archived brand with the expected release of jem and the holograms by hasbro’s own recently established film label allspark pictures

hasbro’s strategic blueprint and brand architecture focuses on extending its brands through digital media and gaming in support of this strategy in 2013 the company acquired a 70 majority ownership in backflip studios llc “backflip” a mobile game developer based in boulder colorado backflip’s product offerings include games for tablets and mobile devices including dragonvale ninjump and paper toss new game brands released during 2014 include dwarven den plundernauts spellfall and seabeard backflip also introduced two game brands under hasbro brands specifically nerfhoops and twister tap in 2015 and beyond backflip intends to continue focusing on its existing game titles particularly dragonvale and to launch new games including those based on hasbro brands to further extend its brands into digital media and gaming the company also outlicenses its properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games and other gaming experiences based on those brands one example of these digital gaming relationships is the company’s agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” under which ea has the rights to develop several of hasbro’s bestselling gaming brands for mobile platforms globally similarly the company has an agreement with activision under which activision offers digital games based on the transformers brand as well as with other thirdparty digital gaming companies including dena and gameloft

as hasbro seeks to grow its business in entertainment licensing and digital gaming the company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances acquisitions and investments like hasbro studios and backflip which may complement its current product offerings allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company announced a multiyear cost savings initiative in which it targets annual cost reductions of 100000 by the end of 2015 this plan included an approximate 10 workforce reduction facility consolidations and process improvements which reduce redundancy and increase efficiencies from 2012 through 2014 the company incurred aggregate restructuring and related pension charges of 84972 and productrelated charges of 19736 related to this plan through 2014 the company recognized gross cost savings before restructuring costs from these actions of approximately 90000 these savings are prior to other costs which have or are anticipated to increase in 2014 and in future years such as compensation costs and other investments in certain components of the business 

the company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year in each of 2014 and 2013 the second half of the year accounted for 65 of net revenues while the second half of 2012 accounted for 64 of net revenues

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial 

  

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

sales allowances 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2014 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 28 2014 we have 68190 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2015 through 2017 future program production cost 

  

amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists 

performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 474327 the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2014 the company has 119111 of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit because backflip was a recent acquisition the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014 for this reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value backflip’s impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings including releases based on existing backflip and hasbro game titles as well as a discount rate commensurate with the emerging digital landscape the underlying cash flows are based on longterm financial plans for backflip which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired 

the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 75738 with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets 

the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the company’s goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment 

  

and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 248790 at december 28 2014 during 2014 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 28 2014 the company had 230840 of prepaid royalties 132146 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 98694 of which are included in other assets during 2014 there were no significant charges related to this policy 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2014 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2014 pension expense for us plans by approximately 660 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2014 pension expense was 502 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2014 pension expense by approximately 460

approximately 12175 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 74700 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 28 2014 these contracts had net unrealized gains of 65937 of which 35086 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 34062 are recorded in other assets and 2591 are recorded in accrued liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 28 2014 are deferred gains of 64200 net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 28 2014 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 1559895 of this longterm debt 600000 represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 300000 of 315 notes due 2021 and 300000 of 510 notes due 2044 during the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 500000 to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate associated with the may 2014 debt issuance these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance 33306 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 28 2014 are deferred losses net of tax of 20511 related to these derivatives 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 39 and 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 2012 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

  

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2014 approximately 65 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2014 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe latin and south america and the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into emerging markets in eastern europe asia and latin and south america emerging markets are an area of high priority for hasbro as they offer greater opportunities for revenue growth key emerging markets include russia brazil and the people’s republic of china “china” in 2013 and 2012 net revenues in emerging markets grew 25 and 16 respectively and represented more than 10 of consolidated net revenues in each of these years key brands during 2013 included furby furreal friends littlest pet shop magic the gathering marvel products monopoly my little pony nerf playdoh playskool star wars products and transformers 

entertainment and licensing 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital gaming television and movie entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the out 

  

licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics or in certain situations to utilize them for toy products where we consider the outlicensing of brands to be more effective 

our digital gaming business seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands our agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” grants exclusive worldwide rights to create mobile games based on a number of our intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee and game of life we also have agreements with activision for digital games based on the transformers brand dena for mobile games based on the transformers brand gameloft for mobile games based on my little pony and littlest pet shop brands jagex for an online transformers game for western markets and ubisoft for console games based on monopoly scrabble trivial pursuit and others we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming including scientific games corporation furthermore in july 2013 we acquired a 70 majority stake in backflip a mobile game developer whose mobile gaming product offerings include dragonvale ninjump and paper toss in 2014 and beyond backflip intends to focus on its existing product lines and launching new games including those based on hasbro brands 

to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we operate a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios which produces television programming primarily based on our brands which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates hub network a cable television network in the united states hub network is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in june 2014 transformers age of extinction the fourth major motion picture based on the transformers brand is scheduled to be released by paramount pictures in 2013 gi joe retaliation the second major motion picture based on the gi joe brand was released in may 2012 battleship was released by universal pictures 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide our consumers with the ability to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce game products sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is located 

  

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

each of our four product categories namely boys games girls and preschool generate greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed primarily through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2013 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 34 and 31 of full year net revenues respectively 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers generally time their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2014 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2013 and in prior years 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2013 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

royalties and product development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred expenses of 207591 201197 and 197638 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

  

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred 338919 302066 and 339217 respectively of royalty expense in 2013 royalty expense included 63801 related to the settlement of an arbitration award for a dispute between the company and an inventor as well as the amendment of its license agreement with zynga our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments we also maintain sales and marketing functions in our selling entities which are responsible for local market activities and execution our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while this concentration of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2013 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation represented 16 10 and 9 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart toys “r” us inc and target accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 61 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television in addition we engage in digital marketing and advertising for our brands generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios produces television entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on hub network in the us other major networks internationally and on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred 398098 422239 and 413951 respectively in expense related to advertising and promotion programs certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures generally do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other nonentertainment based products 

  

manufacturing and importing 

during 2013 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from suppliers in the united states and certain other countries 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2014 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and hub network compete with other children’s television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and brandedplay entertainment companies we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age thereby the variety of product and entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product lifecycles have shrunk as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at younger ages we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers we also compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with entertainment offerings of many technology companies such as makers of tablets mobile devices video games and other consumer electronic products 

  

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 29 2013 we employed approximately 5000 persons worldwide approximately 2500 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition a few of our products such as the food mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and on the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment health safety and other matters

we are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and partner brands 

we have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer larger global brands as we build our business we are moving away from sku making behaviors which involve building a large number of products across many brands towards global brand building with an emphasis on our franchise and partner brands which we view as having the largest global potential as we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blue print and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in wide array of markets in 2013 revenues from our seven franchise brands littlest pet shop magic the gathering monopoly nerf my little pony playdoh and transformers totaled 44 of our aggregate net revenues our key partner brands such as disney marvel lucasfilm sesame street and rovio also constitute a significant portion of our overall business together our franchise and partner brands are critical to our business if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed 

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual child and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our child and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different 

  

tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them 

children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to combine digital and analog play and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 the children’s and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailer’s private label toy products our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

in recent years retailers have also developed their own privatelabel products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers some retail chains that are our customers sell privatelabel children’s and family entertainment products designed manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves these products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share 

  

an inability to develop and introduce planned products product lines and new brands in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing products product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued 

united states global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

challenging market conditions in certain developed economies such as in the united states canada australia and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed 

our future success in the united states canada australia europe and other developed economies is impacted by market conditions for example a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states and other developed economies may harm our business 

many categories within the toy game and family entertainment industries in the united states canada australia certain western european countries and other developed economies have not grown or in some cases have even declined in recent years in addition many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly if at all in the next several years we have substantial business in developed economies and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining to succeed in a market that is stable or declining we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult this will be an additional challenge for the company 

  

an increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges 

we expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets including eastern europe latin america and asia in 2013 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14 of our net revenues up from only 6 of our net revenues in 2010 over time we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets operating in an increasing number of markets each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates presents additional challenges that we must meet in addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to other risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business 

our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners 

as part of our strategy in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel and star wars owned by disney as well as sesame street and rovio these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars sesame street and rovio licenses have been highly significant to our business if we fail to meet our contractual commitments andor any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness and brand building 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures digital products dvd releases and other media have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our owned and partner brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction 

  

with planned media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit developed or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together this can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

hub network our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that hub network will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally and backflip studio’s digital products compete with content from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by hasbro studios and backflip studios or other content appearing on hub network and products related to that content could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in hub network such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for hub network during 2013 the company spent 41325 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2014 and future years 

at december 29 2013 321876 or 73 of our total assets represented our investment in hub network if hub network does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

  

the level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our under producing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 29 2013 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 16 10 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 61 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which combine digital and analog play these products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture margins on some portion of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

  

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products or products that combine digital and analog technology tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs additionally designing developing and producing electronic and digital products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games delays in the design development or production of electronic or digital products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such projects in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 29 2013 our net revenues from the international segment comprised approximately 46 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located in the far east to produce the substantial majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts natural disasters increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control 

  

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars sesame street or rovio related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 29 2013 we had 294991 of prepaid royalties 152459 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 142532 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 29 2013 we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 332000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the substantial majority of our products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

we own and operate two manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers the majority of which are located in china although should changes be necessary our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our 

  

business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

if we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming our revenues and profitability may decline 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products we recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time as well as offer innovative face to face off the board and digital gaming opportunities people are gaming in greater numbers than ever before but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly to be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed additionally we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required from our changing global business we have added hundreds of employees in our global markets while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years these changes in employee composition both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets has required 

  

changes in our business our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses to improve our profitability and competitiveness in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative the objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual gross amount of 100 million by the end of 2015 we intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives workforce reductions facility consolidation and other process improvements however these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our commercial paper program revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions and availability under our committed revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to 700000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

we also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017 which provides for a 700000 committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity this facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

  

as of december 29 2013 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding including our 6125 notes which are due in may of 2014 which include principal amounts of 425000 if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the children’s online privacy protection act while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our 

  

intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets however as of december 29 2013 we had 375999 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions or investments we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings andor the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels additionally through our acquisition of a 70 interest in backflip studios we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise however we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the 

  

protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers our consumers or ourselves failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of this data could disrupt our operations damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities that could be material 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 29 2013 594321 or 135 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically 

  

against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2013 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on hub network and available on netflix and itunes our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 29 2013 we have 79965 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that approximately 93 of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2014 through 2016 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2013 the company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the company’s annual impairment tests related to 

  

intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 29 2013 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 670059 recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 300261 at december 29 2013 during 2013 the company incurred 19736 in impairment charges relating to reduced expectations for certain products as well as the decision to exit certain other product lines

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 29 2013 the company had 294991 of prepaid royalties 152459 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 142532 of which are included in other assets during 2013 the company incurred 20851 related to the amendment of its’ license agreement with zynga as a result of this settlement the company agreed to pay zynga 12500 in satisfaction of all future required royalty advances with the remainder of the charge comprised of a writedown of prepaid royalties 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year during 2013 the company recognized pension curtailment and settlement charges of 6993 related to its us pension plans as a result of headcount reductions due to restructuring activities 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment 

  

classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2013 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2013 pension expense for us plans by approximately 630 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2013 pension expense was 449 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2013 pension expense by approximately 459 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 29 2013 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 69716 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 138946 at december 30 2012 the decrease primarily reflects unrecognized actuarial gains in 2013 compared to losses in 2012 primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 29 2013 as well as benefits paid in 2013 related to workforce reductions the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 29 2013 increased to 502 at december 29 2013 from 409 used at december 30 2012 a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased the 2013 projected benefit obligation by approximately 9722 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company’s interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the company’s estimated effective income tax rate during 2013 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2013 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 30000 associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of us tax examinations as well as certain other us and foreign prior period tax adjustments 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize 

  

the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries at december 29 2013 the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 492000 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 1384895 in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 29 2013 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 29 2013 are as follows 

 

 included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 29 2013 the company has a liability including potential interest and penalties of 80006 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability accordingly these amounts are not included in the table above 

in connection with the company’s agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above 

in july 2013 the company acquired a 70 stake in backflip and will be required to purchase the remaining 30 in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics the company does not know the ultimate timing that these predetermined financial performance metrics may be met and thereby cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining 30 

in july 2013 the company amended agreements with disney related to its marvel and star wars licenses which provide for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities in connection with the marvel amendment the marvel license has been extended through 2020 and may require up to 170000 in guaranteed royalties that are not included in the table above are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be 

  

payable during the next six years approximately 50000 of these additional royalties are expected to be paid in 2014 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases additional guaranteed royalties related to the amendment of the star wars license agreement are included in the table above 

purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2013 

in addition to the amounts included in the table above the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 6400 related to its unfunded us and other international pension plans in 2014 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 209398 at december 29 2013 

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 48144 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 29 2013 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 10875 of which 386 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 1069 are recorded in other assets 10260 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 2070 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 29 2013 are deferred losses of 9337 net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 29 2013 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding adjustments of 1384895 the company was party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific longterm debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the fair value was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is now being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations over the life of the remaining longterm debt using a straightline method at december 29 2013 this adjustment to longterm debt was 3390 as a result of this termination longterm debt 

  

is no longer affected by variable interest rates and thereby earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates the company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt excluding the current portion by approximately 23000 

of the 1384895 in fixed rate longterm debt at december 29 2013 425000 matures in may 2014 the company currently expects to issue longterm notes in 2014 to finance the repayment of most if not all of this debt as such during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with total notional value of 300000 to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate associated with the expected issuance of longterm debt to refinance most if not all of the aforementioned current portion of longterm debt these interest rate swaps were matched with the expected longterm debt issuance and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments the fair value of these instruments is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive earnings and will be amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method once the expected debt issuance occurs at december 29 2013 the fair value of these instruments is 3172 and is recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 39 of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 42 and 45 of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2013 approximately 65 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2013 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

us and canada 

this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories in the united states and canada the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages off of efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s brands through entertainment experiences such as motion pictures television publishing and digital gaming major 2012 brands and products included magic the gathering marvel products nerf beyblade products star wars products transformers playdoh furby furreal friends and playskool 

international 

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe and latin and south america as well as in the asia pacific region and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence in addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries in recent years we expanded our operations by opening offices in brazil peru colombia china russia the czech republic and korea we plan to continue to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through continued investment key international brands for 2012 included marvel products nerf beyblade products playdoh littlest pet shop furreal friends transformers monopoly star wars products playskool my little pony and magic the gathering 

entertainment and licensing 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital gaming movie television and online entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics 

our digital gaming category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games for play on mobile devices personal computers and video game consoles based on those brands our agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” which provides ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on our rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games based on a number of our intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee and game of life is one example of these digital relationships similarly we have an agreement with activision under which activision offers digital games based on the transformers brand we also partner with dena for mobile games based on the transformers brand gameloft for mobile games based on my little pony and littlest pet shop brands jagex for an online transformers game for western markets and with callaway digital arts for the mr potato head mobile app we also license our brands to third parties engaged in other forms of gaming 

to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we established a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios which produces television programming primarily based on our brands which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates a television network in the united states the hub the hub is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in july 2011 transformers dark of the moon the third major motion picture based on the transformers brand was released in may 2012 battleship was released by universal pictures in 

  

2013 gi joe retaliation the second major motion picture based on the gi joe brand is scheduled to be released by paramount pictures the company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our owned and controlled brands provide our consumers with the ability to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce game products sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is located 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

each of our four product categories namely boys girls games and preschool generates greater than 10 of our net revenues for more information including the amount of net revenues attributable to each of our four product categories see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are financed primarily through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2012 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 64 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33 and 31 of full year revenues respectively 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers generally time their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of 

  

purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2013 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2012 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2012 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

royalties and product development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy and game products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred expenses of 201197 197638 and 201358 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred 302066 339217 and 248570 respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

marketing and sales 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments we also maintain sales and marketing functions in our selling entities who are responsible for local market activities and execution our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in 

  

areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2012 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation represented 17 11 and 10 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart toys “r” us inc and target accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 64 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television in addition we engage in digital marketing and advertising for our brands generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios produces television entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on the hub in the us other major networks internationally as well as on various other digital platforms such as netflix and itunes we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred 422239 413951 and 420651 respectively in expense related to advertising and promotion programs certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures generally do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other nonentertainment based products 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2012 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from suppliers in the united states and certain other countries 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2013 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or 

  

the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and the hub compete with other children’s television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon cartoon network and disney channel for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and branded play entertainment companies in our business we must deal with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children has greatly expanded we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of tablets video games and other consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment low barriers to entry and new technologies continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 30 2012 we employed approximately 5500 persons worldwide approximately 2800 of whom were located in the united states during the fourth quarter of 2012 we announced a cost savings initiative that is expected to result in an overall reduction in our global workforce by approximately 10 primarily during 2013 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an 

  

“imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the childrens’ online privacy protection act 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

consumer interests change rapidly making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families 

the interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content products and play patterns which will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and quickly develop innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time attention and spending this challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of entertainment offerings available to them 

children are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative technologydriven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies to meet this challenge we and our competitors are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology seek to combine digital and analog play and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media 

with the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 the children’s and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete in the united states and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of analog toys and games digital gaming products digital media products which combine analog and digital play and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers we face competitors who 

  

are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets and has broadened the array of companies we compete with new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our revenues and lower our profitability 

an inability to develop and introduce planned new brands products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing new brands products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 

united states global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate recessions credit crises and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the united states and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

  

challenging market conditions in certain developed markets such as in the united states and certain western european countries make it more difficult for us to succeed 

our future success in the united states and europe is impacted by market conditions a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which may negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets similar negative events impacting the market in the united states may harm our business 

many components of the toy game and family entertainment industries in the united states and certain western european countries have not grown or in some cases have even contracted in recent years these markets represent a majority of our current product sales it is more difficult for us to grow or even maintain our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing to succeed in a market that is stable or contracting we must gain market share from our competitors which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market as long as economic conditions in the united states and certain european markets remain difficult this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome 

loss of a significant licensed property could harm our business 

in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties 

we currently have inlicenses to several successful entertainment properties including marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street these licenses typically have multiyear terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products in recent years our sales of products under the marvel star wars beyblade and sesame street licenses have been highly significant to our business if any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license 

our license to the marvel property is granted from marvel entertainment llc and marvel characters bv together “marvel” our license to the star wars property is granted by lucas licensing ltd and lucasfilm ltd together “lucas” both marvel and lucas are owned by the walt disney company 

delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands can harm our business and profitability 

entertainment media in forms such as television motion pictures dvd releases and other media can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our owned and licensed brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success we spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors and studio and media partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit or released and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates this can make it difficult for us to plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

  

lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business 

motion pictures television or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

the hub our cable television joint venture with discovery communications inc in the united states competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that the hub will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally competes with programming from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of programming developed by hasbro studios or other programming appearing on the hub and products related to that programming could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in the hub such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for the hub during 2012 the company paid 59277 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2013 and future years 

at december 30 2012 330746 or 76 of our total assets represented our investment in the hub if the hub does not achieve success or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which marry digital and analog play the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short lifespans 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as video games consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronic and digital products in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products or products that marry digital and analog technology tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

  

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues profitability and business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 30 2012 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results as reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net revenues the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel star wars beyblade or sesame street related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 30 2012 we had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 30 2012 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 227000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainmentbased properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

  

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully meet consumer demand additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 30 2012 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 17 11 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 64 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of 

  

their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

we own and operate two manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the people’s republic of china “china” although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations may be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured 

given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition we require that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

  

difficulties associated with the implementation of our plan to reinvent our gaming business may harm our revenues and profitability 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming we also are designing our gaming products to recognize the need to provide immersive game play in shorter periods of time and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gaming business and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gaming business in the future could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gaming strategy 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future could significantly harm our business 

to remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard 

our business is extremely competitive the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable to compete we must continuously improve our processes increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses to improve our profitability and competitiveness in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative the objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual amount of 100 million by 2015 we intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer more global brand initiatives workforce reductions facility consolidation and other process improvements however this is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goals 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017 which provides for a 700000 committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

we also have a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions allows us to issue up to 700000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working 

  

capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time at december 30 2012 there was 209200 outstanding under this program 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 30 2012 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of longterm debt outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the childrens’ online privacy protection act while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

  

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the united states and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the united states and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 30 2012 we had 416659 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we may acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient 

  

operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers our consumers or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 30 2012 474925 or 110 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations

boys net revenues in the boys category decreased 13 in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower net revenues from transformers and beyblade products which were partially offset by higher sales of marvel products primarily due to sales of products based on the theatrical releases of marvel’s the avengers in may 2012 and the amazing spiderman in july 2012 in 2011 net revenues in the boys category grew 35 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher net revenues from transformers beyblade and kreo products in 2011 transformers net revenues were positively impacted by the theatrical release of transformers dark of the moon in june 2011 also 2011 marked the first full year of sales of beyblade products which were reintroduced during the second half of 2010 and the introduction of kreo products during the second half of 2011

in 2012 higher net revenues from my little pony and easy bake products as well as the introduction of furby and one direction products contributed to growth in the girls category these increases were partially offset by lower net revenues from furreal friends strawberry shortcake littlest pet shop and baby alive products in 2012 in 2011 moderately higher net revenues from my little pony and baby alive products compared to 2010 were more than offset by lower net revenues from furreal friends and littlest pet shop products

in the boys category higher net revenues from marvel particularly movierelated products related to the avengers and spiderman kreo and star wars products in 2012 compared to 2011 were more than offset by lower net revenues from beyblade and transformers products in 2011 higher net revenues from beyblade transformers particularly movierelated products and nerf products compared to 2010 as well as higher net revenues from beyblade kreo and super soaker products contributed to the category’s growth in the international segment

entertainment and licensing 

entertainment and licensing segment net revenues increased 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 and 19 in 2011 compared to 2010 increases for each year were primarily due to the sale and distribution of television programming which included global television distribution digital distribution and home entertainment increased net revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by decreased net revenues from lifestyle licensing primarily relating to lower transformers movierelated licensing revenues whereas lifestyle licensing revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 related to transformers movierelated licensing revenues 

entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased 24 in 2012 compared to 2011 and decreased 1 in 2011 compared to 2010 in 2012 higher net revenues from television programming distribution directly contributed to a higher operating profit in 2011 the impact of higher net revenues was offset by investments made by the company to grow its global licensing organization as well as increased program production cost amortization reflecting the fact that 2011 was the first full year of television programming distribution

related to the volume of entertainmentdriven products sold in a given year especially if there is a major motion picture release higher royalty expense in 2011 compared to 2012 and 2010 primarily reflects the higher sales of certain entertainmentdriven products in 2011 primarily beyblade and transformers products compared to 2012 and 2010 in 2012 sales of marvel products particularly those related to marvel’s the avengers and the amazing spiderman partially offset the reduction in sales of beyblade and movierelated transformers products from the prior year

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

sales allowances 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2012 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information if estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the 

  

quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub and available on netflix and itunes our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 30 2012 we have 91975 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2013 through 2015 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2012 the company did not incur any significant impairment charges related to its program production costs 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the company’s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 30 2012 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550663 recorded on the balance sheet 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 340921 at december 30 2012 during 2012 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

  

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 30 2012 the company had 163875 of prepaid royalties 86361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77514 of which are included in other assets 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the company’s us plans are established at the company’s measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2012 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2012 pension expense for us plans by approximately 650 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2012 pension expense averaged 496 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2012 pension expense by approximately 430 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 30 2012 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 138946 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 104872 at december 25 2011 the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2012 primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 30 2012 partially offset by the amount by which the company’s 2012 actual return on plan assets exceeded the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2012 expense the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 30 2012 decreased to 409 at december 30 2012 from 496 used at december 25 2011 a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased the 2012 projected benefit obligation by approximately 12026 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

  

income taxes

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing 

  

those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 61622 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 30 2012 these contracts had net unrealized losses of 1720 of which 1729 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 12 are recorded in other assets 3106 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 355 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 30 2012 are deferred losses of 1008 net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 30 2012 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding adjustments of 1384895 the company was party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps were matched with specific longterm debt issues and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts were wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt in november 2012 these interest rate swap agreements were terminated the fair value was recorded as an adjustment to longterm debt and is now being amortized through the statement of operations over the life of the remaining longterm debt using a straightline method at december 30 2012 this adjustment to longterm debt was 11526 as a result of this termination longterm debt is no longer affected by variable interest rates and thereby earnings and cash flows are not expected to be impacted by changes in interest rates the company estimates that a hypothetical quarter percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 31000 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2012 and 45 and 50 of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 2010 respectively in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2012 approximately 64 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing 

  

strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2012 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

segments 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products described above our toy game and puzzle products are primarily developed by a global development group while our global marketing function establishes brand direction and assists the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products and also conducts our movie television and online entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

the company’s strategy is focused around reimagining reinventing and reigniting its existing brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands globally through the development and marketing of innovative toy and game products providing immersive entertainment experiences for our consumers and expansion of our brands into other consumer products through broad licensing programs including digital media and lifestyle products the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada 

this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories in the united states and canada the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new products and initiatives driven by consumer and 

  

marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages off of efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s core brands through entertainment experiences such as motion pictures television publishing and digital gaming major 2011 brands and products included beyblade products transformers nerf magic the gathering marvel products star wars products furreal friends sesame street products littlest pet shop and playskool 

international 

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe asia pacific and latin and south america and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america we have offices in more than 35 countries contributing to sales in more than 120 countries in recent years we expanded our operations by opening offices in brazil peru colombia china russia the czech republic romania and korea we plan to continue to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through continued investment key international brands for 2011 included beyblade products transformers nerf littlest pet shop playdoh furreal friends playskool monopoly star wars products and magic the gathering 

entertainment and licensing 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital gaming movie television and online entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics 

our digital gaming category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties in the digital area such as for applications on mobile phones personal computers and video game consoles this is primarily done through our longterm strategic partnership with ea which provides ea with the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all of these major platforms based on most of our toy and game intellectual properties in digital gaming we also have strategic partnerships with activision majesco net dragon jagex and perfect world to develop digital games and applications for 2012 and beyond 

to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we established a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios which produces television programming primarily based on our brands as well as thirdparty branded content which is distributed on a global basis in addition hasbro studios has a coordinated development process which aligns with our 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates a television network in the united states the hub which debuted in october 2010 the hub is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in 2009 transformers revenge of the fallen and gi joe the rise of cobra were released based on our brands in july 2011 transformers dark of the moon the third major motion picture based on the transformers brand was released the next motion pictures based on the company’s properties include battleship which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by universal pictures and gi joe retaliation which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by paramount pictures the company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years 

major motion pictures and television programming based on our own and controlled brands provide our consumers with the ability to experience these properties in a different format which we believe can result in 

  

increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from toy and game product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

global operations 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce games and puzzles sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

other information 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products directly to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

during 2011 net revenues generated from transformers and beyblade products were approximately 483000 and 477000 respectively which were 113 and 111 respectively of our consolidated net revenues for that year during 2010 net revenues generated from nerf products were approximately 414000 which was 103 of our consolidated net revenues for that year during 2009 net revenues generated from transformers products were approximately 592000 which was 145 of our consolidated net revenues in that year no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2011 2010 or 2009 

working capital requirements 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2011 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 63 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 32 and 31 of full year revenues respectively 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery recent trends have shown that retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers 

  

prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the amount of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year these programs follow general industry practices the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2012 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2011 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2011 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program and uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

royalties and product development 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2011 2010 and 2009 we incurred expenses of 197638 201358 and 181195 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we incurred 339217 248570 and 330651 respectively of royalty expense our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands on a consistent global basis we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of 

  

customers there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2011 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation represented 20 11 and 10 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart target and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 45 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 68 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well in addition hasbro studios produces television entertainment based primarily on our brands which appears on the hub in the us and on other major networks internationally we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2011 we incurred 413951 in expense related to advertising and promotion programs compared to 420651 in 2010 and 412580 in 2009 certain entertainmentbased products such as products based on major motion pictures do not require the same level of advertising that we spend on other products 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2011 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us we purchase most of our raw materials and component parts used in our owned manufacturing facilities from manufacturers in the united states and other certain countries 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2012 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured and production shifted to those new sources the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing 

  

in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

competition 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in entertainment hasbro studios and the hub compete with other children’s television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon and cartoon network for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and branded play entertainment companies in our business we must deal with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children has greatly expanded we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products that compete with our toy and game offerings 

employees 

at december 25 2011 we employed approximately 5900 persons worldwide approximately 3200 of whom were located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

government regulation 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

  

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many international markets including canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission as well as the laws of certain other countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

the volatility of changing consumer interests makes it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families 

the children’s and family entertainment business is one in which consumer interests evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year to be successful requires properly anticipating what content properties and products will capture children’s and families’ interests and imagination and then quickly developing and marketing products to meet those interests critical to this process is understanding market insights that drive product popularity and providing innovative product offerings which can compete successfully against many other products for consumers’ limited time attention and spending 

our performance depends on our successful ability to develop market and sell innovative toys games and other entertainment offerings and license our brands for products which are sought after by consumers including both children and their parents we need to do this in an environment of rapidly evolving consumer tastes and increasing utilization of technology and digital media in product offerings consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate we may not successfully identify design and market product offerings which are sought after by consumers evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for 

  

children’s and families’ interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers’ minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles 

if we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and consumer products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us our sales and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged similarly brands or products that were successful at one time may lose consumer interest over time as tastes change and product innovation continues our success is critically dependent upon developing and maintaining the consumer appeal of our brands and products and in our ongoing ability to achieve and maintain market interest in and acceptance of our offerings to a degree that enables those brands and products to be profitable 

additionally our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets outside of the united states as such our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in different markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience 

a decline in the popularity of our existing brands products and product lines or the failure of our new brands products and product lines to achieve and sustain sufficient interest from retailers and consumers could significantly lower our revenues and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the incredible array of entertainment offerings available to them children are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys and games to a wider array of innovative technology driven entertainment products at younger and younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies digital media and social media companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

  

  

 an inability to develop and introduce planned new brands products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

in developing new brands products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a costeffective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands this risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business the risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies utilizing digital media to a greater degree and providing greater innovation and product differentiation unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 

  

the children’s and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our sales market share and profitability could decline 

the children’s and family entertainment industry is and will continue to be highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers marketers and sellers of toys games video games digital media and other entertainment and consumer products as well as with retailers we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing 

in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry are low and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time these existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products lower our sales and lower our profitability 

delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands or lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment media can harm our business and profitability 

as part of our strategy of offering immersive branded play experiences we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as many different forms and formats as possible entertainment media in forms such as motion pictures and television can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success 

the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of media efforts by us and our partners television programming motion picture and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products and brands and we spend considerable amounts of time and sums of money in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the timing of media development release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts 

for example development and release of motion pictures based on our brands involves working extremely closely with our studio partners in indentifying projects developing them and scheduling them for release the ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our studio partners we do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit or released this can make it difficult for us to plan our future movie slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture releases given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts 

when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

even when motion pictures television or other media is developed and released consumers may not be as interested in that media and in any associated products as we had anticipated while it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts given the broad array of competing offerings if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed 

  

in 2009 we entered into a joint venture with discovery communications inc through that joint venture we launched a children’s and family entertainment channel called the hub in october of 2010 in connection with this joint venture effort we also developed a whollyowned studio called hasbro studios which is responsible for developing and producing television entertainment media based on our owned and licensed brands the television programming developed by hasbro studios is offered in the united states on the hub and is distributed on other networks internationally 

the hub is competing with a number of other children’s television networks in the united states for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that the hub will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally competes with programming from many other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of programming developed by hasbro studios or other programming appearing on the hub and products related to that programming could significantly harm our business particularly given that we are investing significant sums of money developing that programming similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with our investment in the hub such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for the hub during 2011 the company incurred 80983 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2012 and future years 

at december 25 2011 343835 or 83 of our total assets represented our investment in the hub if the hub does not achieve success or there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

us global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

we design manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending recessions and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the us and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending andor sales allowances or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability 

given the difficult economic conditions in the united states over the past few years we have been challenged in our efforts to grow our us business and improve its profitability as long as economic conditions in the us remain difficult this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome if we are to succeed in our efforts at growing this business similarly while our european business has grown significantly in recent years our future success in europe is dependent upon economic conditions in europe a european sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to european markets could lead to a recession in europe which would negatively impact consumers and in turn sales of our products in the european markets 

  

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our sales profitability and our business 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 25 2011 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance 

our global operations mean we produce and buy products and sell products in many different jurisdictions with many different foreign currencies as a result if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net sales the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as beyblade marvel sesame street or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 25 2011 we had 134730 of prepaid royalties 16788 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 117942 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 25 2011 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 235000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy game or other family entertainment products and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us 

  

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

sales of our toys games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 25 2011 walmart stores inc toys “r” us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 20 11 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys “r” us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 45 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 68 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us favor competitors or new entrants increase their direct competition with us by expanding their privatelabel business change their purchasing patterns alter the manner in which they promote 

  

our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition customers make no binding longterm commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products in addition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers furthermore the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result in higher bad debt expense 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

we own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the people’s republic of china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a significant period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political civil labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations would be substantially disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of supply were secured this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business 

given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortages and increases in labor costs in china and difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports in north america and europe whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a thirdparty manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions our global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition hasbro requires that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

  

greater than expected costs or difficulties associated with the implementation of our plan to reinvent our gaming business may harm our revenues and profitability 

recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future in 2011 we began implementing a ten point strategy to reinvent our gaming business the objective of this plan is to stabilize our gaming business in 2012 and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond as part of executing this strategy in the second quarter of 2011 we announced our creation of a gaming center of excellence in rhode island our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming we also are designing our gaming products to recognize the need to provide immersive gameplay in shorter periods of time and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gaming business and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gaming business in the future could substantially harm our business resulting in lost revenues and lost profits there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gaming strategy 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees 

our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work that drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in recruiting hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees there is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit hire or retain the senior management officers and other employees we need to succeed our loss of key management or other employees or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future could significantly harm our business 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products incorporating greater technology the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames consumer electronics and social and digital media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toy and game products examples of such products in the last few years include our furreal friends line of products including cookiemy playful pup butterscotch pony and biscuitmy lovin’ pup increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy these electronic and digital products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic and digital products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

  

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2014 which provides for a 500000 committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

in early 2011 we established a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions will allow us to issue up to 500000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working capital funding and liquidity there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 25 2011 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities in addition advertising to children is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission the federal communications commission and a host of other agencies globally while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product 

  

recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property is of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the us and around the world from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in the us and around the world in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 25 2011 we had 467293 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their 

  

realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including management of our supply chain sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as hurricanes fires floods earthquakes tornadoes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability 

if our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed 

we maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data in addition we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data any compromise of the confidential data of our customers our consumers or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 25 2011 474792 or 115 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net earnings caused by the writedown of goodwill could harm our results of operations

while the company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths and allow the company to offer innovative products based on movie television music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties the company’s primary licenses include its agreements with marvel characters bv “marvel” for characters in the marvel universe including iron man and spiderman lucas licensing ltd “lucas” related to the star wars brand and sesame workshop related to the sesame street

the company also seeks to build immersive brand experiences and drive productrelated revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment such as motion pictures and television programming since 2007 the company has had three motion pictures based on its transformers brand and one motion picture based on its gi joe brand released by major motion picture studios this includes the release of the third transformers motion picture transformers dark of the moon  in 2011 the company developed and marketed product lines based on these motion pictures the next motion pictures based on the company’s properties are battleship which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by universal pictures and gi joe retaliation which is scheduled to be released in 2012 by paramount pictures the company has motion picture projects based on other brands in development for potential release in future years 

in addition to using motion pictures to provide entertainment experiences for its brands the company established hasbro studios an internal whollyowned production studio in 2009 hasbro studios is responsible for the creation and development of television programming based primarily on hasbro’s brands this programming is currently aired throughout the world the company is a 50 partner in a joint venture with discovery communications inc “discovery” which runs the hub a cable television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming programming on the hub includes content based on hasbro’s brands discovery’s library of children’s educational programming as well as programming developed by third parties hasbro studios programming is distributed in the us exclusively to the hub while programming internationally is distributed to leading children’s networks around the world the company’s television initiatives support its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond traditional toys and games and providing entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format 

the company’s strategic blueprint also focuses on extending its brands further into digital media and gaming including through the licensing of the company’s properties to a number of partners who develop and offer digital games based on those brands an example of these digital gaming relationships is the company’s agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” which provides ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on the company’s rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games for all platforms such as mobile phones gaming consoles and personal computers based on a number of the company’s intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee nerf tonka and littlest pet shop similarly the company has an agreement with activision under which activision offers digital games based on the transformers brand the company continues to seek and develop additional outlets for its brands in digital gaming including casual mobile and online gaming

as the company seeks to grow its business in entertainment licensing and digital gaming the company will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different forms and formats

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

sales allowances 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to license fees and royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2011 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

program production costs 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review 

  

and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information if estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

for the year ended december 25 2011 we have 80600 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2012 through 2014 the company estimates program production cost amortization in 2012 to be in the range of 60000 to 70000 which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized during 2011 as well as amortization of amounts expected to be incurred for programs to be completed and released in 2012 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2011 the company did not incur any impairment charges related to its program production costs 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the company’s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 25 2011 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550530 recorded on the balance sheet 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an 

  

appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 391555 at december 25 2011 during 2011 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 25 2011 the company had 134730 of prepaid royalties 16788 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 117942 of which are included in other assets 

pension costs and obligations 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the company’s us plans are established at the company’s measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2011 pension expense for the us plans was 725 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2011 pension expense for us plans by approximately 655 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2011 pension expense averaged 520 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2011 pension expense and the 2011 projected benefit obligation by approximately 465 and 11554 respectively 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 25 2011 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 104872 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 87553 at december 26 2010 the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2011 primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to value the liability at december 25 2011 as well as differences between the company’s actual return on plan assets and the expected return assumed in the calculation of the 2011 expense the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 25 2011 decreased to 496 at december 25 2011 from 520 used at december 26 2010 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

  

income taxes 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company’s quarterly operating results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the company’s estimated effective income tax rate during 2011 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2011 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 29600 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of a us tax examination 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return the mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an incomebased tax or an alternative flat tax should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the incomebased tax in 2012 it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable should the facts and circumstances change the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations which may result in additional tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income  which will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive earnings either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity the pronouncement does not change the current option for presenting components of other comprehensive earnings gross or net of the effect of income taxes provided that such effects are presented in the statement in which other comprehensive earnings are presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements additionally the pronouncement does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share the pronouncement also does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive earnings how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net earnings this standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 early application is permitted hasbro expects its adoption will have no effect on its financial position or results of operations but it will impact the way hasbro presents comprehensive earnings 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 1384895 in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 25 2011 future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 25 2011 are as follows 

 

 the company has a liability at december 25 2011 including potential interest and penalties of 97661 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability accordingly these amounts are not included in the table above 

in connection with the company’s agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above 

the company’s agreement with marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities in connection with the extension of the marvel license in 2009 the company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling 140000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next seven years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases 

purchase commitments represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 25 2011 

in addition to the amounts included in the table above the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 5800 related to its unfunded us and other international pension plans in 2012 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 174082 at december 25 2011 

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

  

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 43451 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 25 2011 these contracts had unrealized gains of 7891 of which 7778 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 2021 are recorded in other assets 783 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 1125 are recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 25 2011 are deferred gains of 10081 net of tax related to these derivatives 

at december 25 2011 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding fair value adjustments of 1384895 the company is party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt at december 25 2011 the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 15977 which is included in other assets with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase longterm debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 126700 or 107400 respectively a hypothetical onequarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2011 pretax earnings by 885 and 2011 cash flows by 767 

the economy and inflation 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 45 of its consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 50 and 54 of its consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 2009 respectively in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2011 approximately 63 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

  

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2011 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

segments 

 

organizationally our three principal segments are us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada and international segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed above our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group we also have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and assists the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america the entertainment and licensing segment engages in the outlicensing of our trademarks characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties for noncompeting products and also conducts our movie television and online entertainment operations including the operations of hasbro studios in addition our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the company’s strategy is focused around reimagining reinventing and reigniting its existing brands and imagining inventing and igniting new brands globally through the development and marketing of innovative toy and game products providing immersive entertainment experiences for our consumers and expansion of our brands into other consumer products through a broad licensing program the following is a discussion of each segment 

us and canada 

 

this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories in the united states and canada the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages off of efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s core brands through entertainment experiences such as motion pictures television and publishing major 2010 brands and products included nerf marvel products star wars products littlest pet shop transformers playskool magic the gathering playdoh furreal friends and monopoly 

 

international 

 

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe asia pacific and latin and south america and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america in recent years we expanded our operations in brazil china russia the czech republic romania and korea we will continue to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through the establishment of subsidiaries or increased involvement with our existing distributors the company began operations in peru in 2010 and colombia in 2011 key international brands for 2010 included littlest pet shop nerf transformers monopoly furreal friends playdoh playskool star wars and beyblade 

 

entertainment and licensing 

 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital licensing movie television and online entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics 

 

our digital licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties in the digital area such as for applications on mobile phones personal computers and video game consoles this is primarily done through our longterm strategic alliance with ea which provides ea with the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all of these major platforms based on most of our toy and game intellectual properties 

 

as noted above we own a 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates a television network in the united states the hub which debuted in october 2010 the hub is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming to support our strategic objective of further developing our brands through television entertainment we established a whollyowned television studio hasbro studios that produces programming for distribution on the hub network in the us and for international distribution on other networks the programming is primarily based on our brands but also includes thirdparty branded content hasbro studios has a coordinated development process that aligns with the hub 

 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in 2009 transformers revenge of the fallen and gi joe the rise of cobra were released based on our brands in july 2011 transformers dark of the moon is expected to be released in addition we also have a longterm strategic relationship with universal pictures to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of our core brands with an option to produce two additional movies the first movies under this relationship battleship and ouija  are expected to be released in 2012 

 

promotion of our brands through major motion pictures and television programming provides our consumers with the ability to experience our brands in a different format which we believe can result in 

increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

 

global operations 

 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland which predominantly produce games and puzzles sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products directly to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

during 2010 net revenues generated from nerf products were approximately 414000 which was 103 of our consolidated net revenues for that year during 2009 net revenues generated from transformers products were approximately 592000 which was 145 of our consolidated net revenues in that year no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 or 2009 no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2008 fiscal year 

 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings our borrowings generally reach peak levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half in 2010 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33 and 32 of full year revenues respectively in years where the company has products tied to a major motion picture release such as in 2009 with the midyear releases of transformers revenge of the fallen  gi joe the rise of cobra and xmen origins wolverine  this concentration of revenue late in the year may not be as pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the time of the motion picture theatrical release in 2010 the company had products tied to only one major motion picture release iron man 2 in may 2010 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices 

result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers although the company may receive orders from customers in advance it is a general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and as such the company does not believe that these unshipped orders at any given date are indicative of future sales the amount of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year these programs follow general industry practices the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2011 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2010 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2010 we utilized cash from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

 

royalties and product development 

 

our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our entertainment offerings including both the continuing development of new brands and products and the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2010 2009 and 2008 we spent 201358 181195 and 191424 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 

 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we incurred 248570 330651 and 312986 respectively of royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year may vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media 

 

marketing and sales 

 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands on a consistent global basis we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased 

“etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2010 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc represented 23 12 and 11 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart target and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 50 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 71 of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well hasbro studios also produces television entertainment based on our brands which appears on the hub in the us and on other major networks internationally we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2010 we spent 420651 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 412580 in 2009 and 454612 in 2008 

 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2010 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2011 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal 

trade relations” status by china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the chinese yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

 

we purchase dies and molds from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys and other entertainment offerings but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing in the entertainment arena hasbro studios and the hub compete with other children’s television networks and entertainment producers such as nickelodeon and cartoon network for viewers advertising revenue and distribution 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and branded play entertainment companies in our business we must deal with the phenomenon that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children has expanded we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

 

employees 

 

at december 26 2010 we employed approximately 5800 persons worldwide approximately 3100 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as 

recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in many foreign markets including canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

the volatility of everevolving consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to achieve maintain or build upon the success of our brands products and product lines or introduce successful new brands and products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new brands products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

 

the children’s and family entertainment business is a trenddriven industry where consumer demands and interests evolve quickly we may develop products which consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us similarly brands or products that were successful at one time may lose consumer interest our ongoing success is critically dependent upon developing and maintaining the consumer appeal of our brands and products and in our ongoing ability to achieve and maintain market interest in and acceptance of our offerings to a degree that enables those brands and products to be profitable our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the current preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our business and profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing brands products and product lines or the failure of our new brands products and product lines to achieve and sustain sufficient interest from retailers and consumers could significantly lower our revenues and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is critical to identify and offer what are considered to be the next “hot” toys games and other entertainment offerings on children’s “wish lists” and to effectively anticipate children’s evolving entertainment interests our continued success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys games and other entertainment offerings and license our brands for products which are sought after by both children and their parents in spite of rapidly evolving consumer tastes we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our brands and products through the continued reimagination reinvention reignition and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer interest and imagination offer immersive brand experiences and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns offering continual product innovation and identifying and developing entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations and feed the human need for play however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate and we may not successfully identify product offerings which are sought after by consumers evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers’ minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products and lower our profitability 

 

the challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys and games to a wider array of entertainment products at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies media and social media companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

in developing new brands products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development implementation and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process significant increases in the planned cost of development or changes in anticipated consumer demand for products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 

 

delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands or lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment media can harm our business and profitability 

 

as part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as many different forms and formats as possible entertainment media in forms such as motion pictures and television can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands and the success or lack of success of such media efforts can significantly impact demand for our products and our financial success 

 

the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products and brands not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

similarly if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed in 2009 we entered into a joint venture with discovery communications inc “discovery” through that joint venture we launched a children’s and family entertainment channel called the hub in october of 2010 in connection with this joint venture effort we also developed a whollyowned studio called hasbro studios which is responsible for developing and producing television entertainment media primarily based on our brands the television programming developed by hasbro studios is offered in the united states on the hub and will be distributed on other networks internationally the hub is competing with a number of other children’s television networks in the united states for viewers advertising revenue and distribution fees there is no guarantee that the hub will be successful similarly hasbro studios’ programming distributed internationally competes with programming by other parties lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of the hub programming appearing on the hub other programming developed by hasbro studios and products related to that programming could 

significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with the development of hasbro studios programming during 2010 the company incurred 52047 for programming developed by hasbro studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at increased levels in 2011 and future years 

 

at december 26 2010 354612 or 87 of our total assets represented our investment in the hub if the hub does not achieve success or there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

 

economic downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

 

the success of our family entertainment products and our financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings 

 

recessions and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence similarly reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers such as their homes or stock market investments can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability 

 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues decrease our operating margins increase our costs andor lower our profitability 

 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our business 

 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors 

outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 26 2010 we had 112922 of prepaid royalties 17922 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 95000 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 26 2010 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 287000 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques 

reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial performance 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 26 2010 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 46 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

 13 

 

because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net sales the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be significantly harmed by exchange rate movements 

 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 26 2010 walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 23 12 and 11 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart target and toys “r” us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 50 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 71 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result in higher bad debt expense 

 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

 

we own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations would be disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of supply were secured this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business 

 

given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china labor shortage and increases in labor costs in china and difficulties in moving 

products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports on the western coast of north america whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions the global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition hasbro requires that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right and exercises such right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

 

our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our employees 

 

our employees are at the heart of all of our efforts it is their skill innovation and hard work which drive our success we compete with many other potential employers in hiring and retaining our employees although we continuously seek to develop our employees challenge them and compensate them fairly there is no guarantee that we will be able to hire or retain the employees we need to succeed our loss of key employees or our inability to hire talented employees we need could significantly harm our business 

 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames consumer electronics and social media at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include our ibranded products such as idog and icat and our furreal friends line of products including butterscotch pony and biscuit my lovin’ pup in 2011 we are offering games based on our innovative live platform and our most realistic member of the furreal friends line to date cookie my playful pup these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our 

costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2014 which provides for a 500000 committed revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

 

in early 2011 we established a commercial paper program which subject to market conditions will allow us to issue up to 500000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working capital funding and liquidity we did not renew our accounts receivable securitization facility in january 2011 as we believe issuing commercial paper can be a more cost effective way for us to raise shortterm funding in the future however there is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms or at all at any given point in time 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities or our commercial paper program are adequate for current and planned needs in 2011 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures or other future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 26 2010 we had 1384895 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to 

refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 26 2010 we had 500597 of acquired product and 

licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 26 2010 474813 or 116 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net earnings caused by the writedown of goodwill or our investment in the joint venture could harm our results of operations

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes 

 

sales allowances 

 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to license fees and royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2010 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

 

program production costs 

 

the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company’s toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates 

 

the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are 

estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information if estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise 

 

for the year ended december 26 2010 we have 35415 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet program production cost amortization of 22069 is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 26 2010 we currently expect that over 90 of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over a 4 year period including the year of the programs’ initial broadcast distribution the company estimates program production cost amortization in 2011 to be in the range of 35000 to 45000 which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized during 2010 as well as amortization of amounts expected to be incurred for programs to be completed and released in 2011 future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management’s then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2010 the company did not incur any impairment charges related to its program production costs 

 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test accordingly no impairment was indicated the company’s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and no impairments were indicated the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 26 2010 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550551 recorded on the balance sheet 

 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by 

the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 424859 at december 26 2010 during 2010 the company wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately 3900 to reflect revised expectations of future cash flows for the related product lines 

 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 26 2010 the company had 112922 of prepaid royalties 17922 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 95000 of which are included in other assets 

 

pension costs and obligations 

 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the company’s us plans are established at the company’s measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on us plan assets used in the calculation of 2010 pension expense for the us plans was 80 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2010 pension expense for us plans by approximately 610 

 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2010 pension expense averaged 573 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2010 pension expense and the 2010 projected benefit obligation by approximately 383 and 9815 respectively 

 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 26 2010 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 87553 included in accumulated other 

comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 80201 at december 27 2009 the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in 2010 primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to value the liability at december 26 2010 the discount rate decreased to 520 at december 26 2010 from 573 used at december 27 2009 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

 

an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company’s quarterly operating results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the company’s estimated effective income tax rate during 2010 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2010 the company recorded a total benefit of approximately 22300 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of a us tax examination 

 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future credits deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company’s income tax return in 2007 the mexican government instituted a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an incomebased tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008 should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the incomebased tax in 2011 it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable should the facts and circumstances change the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations which may result in additional tax expense

in connection with the company’s agreement to form a joint venture with discovery the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture accordingly estimates of these amounts are included in the table above 

 

the company’s agreement with marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities the future minimum contractual payments in the table above include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of approximately 19000 payable to marvel that are contingent upon the theatrical release of spiderman 4 which the company currently expects to be paid in 2012 and may be reduced by payments occurring prior to the theatrical release of spiderman 4  in addition in connection with the extension of the marvel license in 2009 the company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling 140000 that are not included in the table above and that may be payable during the next five to six years contingent upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 68455 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 26 2010 these contracts had unrealized gains of 16151 of which 14681 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 1470 are recorded in other assets included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 26 2010 are deferred gains of 15432 net of tax related to these derivatives 

 

at december 26 2010 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding fair value adjustments of 1384895 the company is party to several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt at december 26 2010 the fair value of these contracts was an asset of 12786 which is included in other assets with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase longterm debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 122000 or 104800 respectively a hypothetical onequarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2011 pretax earnings by 882 and 2011 cash flows by 764 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 50 of its consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 54 and 52 of its consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 2008 respectively in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2010 approximately 65 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year although the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year in 2010 the company had products related to the midyear major motion picture release of iron man 2  while in 2009 the company had products related to the midyear major motion picture releases of transformers revenge of the fallen  gi joe the rise of cobra and xmen origins wolverine  the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the 

company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2010 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows

material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

the company believes it is reasonably possible that certain tax examinations and statutes of limitations may be concluded and will expire within the next 12 months and that unrecognized tax benefits excluding potential interest and penalties may decrease by up to approximately 2200 substantially all of which would be recorded as a tax benefit in the statement of operations in addition approximately 300 of potential interest and penalties related to these amounts would also be recorded as a tax benefit in the statement of operations these unrecognized tax benefits primarily relate to both the timing and the nature of the deductibility of certain expenses as well as the tax treatment of certain subsidiary and other transactions

the following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements of the company’s warrants to purchase common stock that use significant unobservable inputs level 3

the company’s strategy is focused around reimagining reinventing and reigniting its brands globally through the development and marketing of innovative toy and game products providing immersive entertainment experiences for our consumers and expansion of our brands into other consumer products the following is a discussion of each segment 

 

us and canada 

 

this segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories in the united states and canada the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands through innovation and reinvention of toys and games this is accomplished through introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy leverages off of efforts to increase consumer awareness of the company’s core brands through entertainment experiences such as motion pictures television and publishing major 2009 brands and products included transformers littlest pet shop star wars nerf monopoly playskool playdoh marvel products magic the gathering gi joe my little pony and furreal friends 

international 

 

the international segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe asia pacific and latin and south america and through distributors in those countries where we have no direct presence in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america in recent years we expanded our operations in brazil china russia the czech republic romania and korea we will continue to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through the establishment of subsidiaries or increased involvement with our existing distributors key international brands for 2009 included transformers littlest pet shop monopoly trivial pursuit star wars playskool and my little pony 

 

entertainment and licensing 

 

our entertainment and licensing segment includes our lifestyle licensing digital licensing movie television and online entertainment operations our lifestyle licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings such as apparel publishing home goods and electronics 

 

our digital licensing category seeks to promote our brands through the outlicensing of our intellectual properties in the digital area such as for applications on mobile phones personal computers and video game consoles this is primarily done through our longterm strategic alliance with electronic arts inc “ea” which provides ea with the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all of these major platforms based on most of our toy and game intellectual properties 

 

as noted above in 2009 we purchased a 50 interest in a joint venture with discovery that operates a television network in the united states this network is dedicated to providing highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming the network is expected to have approximately 60 million subscribers at relaunch the rebranded network the hub is expected to launch in the fall of 2010 to support this venture we established a virtual television studio that will produce programming for the network as well as distribute this programming internationally the programming will primarily be based on our brands but will also include thirdparty branded content the studio will have a coordinated development process that aligns with the network 

 

in addition to the above we also seek to promote and leverage our brands through major motion pictures in 2009 transformers revenge of the fallen and gi joe the rise of cobra were released based on our brands we also have a longterm strategic relationship with universal pictures to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of our core brands with an option to produce two additional movies the first movie under this relationship is expected to be released in 2012 

 

promotion of our brands through major motion pictures and television programming provides our consumers with the ability to experience our brands in a different format which we believe can result in increased product sales royalty revenues and overall brand awareness to a lesser extent we can also earn revenue from our participation in the financial results of motion pictures and related dvd releases and through the distribution of television programming revenue from product sales is a component of the us and canada and international segments while royalty revenues including revenues earned from movies and television programming is included in the entertainment and licensing segment 

 

global operations 

 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary 

operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell a portion of our toy and game products directly to retailers on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

during the 2009 and 2007 fiscal years revenues generated from transformers products were approximately 592000 and 482000 respectively which was 145 and 126 respectively of our consolidated net revenues in those years no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2009 or 2007 no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2008 fiscal year 

 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings and our accounts receivable securitization program our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable securitization program generally reach peak levels during the third quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half and within the second half of the year the fourth quarter is generally more predominant in 2009 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 65 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 31 and 34 of full year revenues respectively in years where the company has products tied to a major motion picture release such as in 2009 with the midyear releases of transformers revenge of the fallen  gi joe the rise of cobra and xmen origins wolverine  and in 2008 with the midyear releases of iron man  the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull  this concentration of revenue late in the year may not be as pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the time of the motion picture theatrical release 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers unshipped orders at january 24 2010 and january 25 2009 were approximately 195000 and 108000 respectively it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year these programs follow general industry practices the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2010 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2009 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected 

consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2009 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit and proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program to meet our cash flow requirements 

 

royalties research and development 

 

our success is dependent on innovation including both the continuing development of new products and the redesign of existing products for continued market acceptance our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments in 2009 2008 and 2007 we spent 181195 191424 and 167194 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2009 2008 and 2007 we incurred 330651 312986 and 316807 respectively of royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment 

 

marketing and sales 

 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands on a consistent global basis we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2009 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc represented 25 13 and 11 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart 

target and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 54 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 74 of our net revenues were derived from our top three customers 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows in 2009 we spent 412580 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 454612 in 2008 and 434742 in 2007 

 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2009 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly the people’s republic of china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2010 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by the people’s republic of china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

 

we purchase dies and molds from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers we also compete with companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children and their families 

competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies in our business we must deal with the phenomenon that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children has expanded we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

 

employees 

 

at december 27 2009 we employed approximately 5800 persons worldwide approximately 3100 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in certain foreign markets such as canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa other applicable domestic and international product standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our product could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

the volatility of everevolving consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain and build upon the success of existing products and product lines or introduce successful new products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

 

the family entertainment business is a fashion industry and evolves quickly our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the current preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our business and profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain interest from retailers and consumers could significantly lower our revenues and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is critical to identify and offer what are considered to be the next “hot” toys and games on children’s “wish lists” and to effectively anticipate children’s evolving entertainment interests our continued 

success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys games and other entertainment offerings and license our brands for products which are sought after by both children and their parents we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the continued reimagination reinvigoration and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer interest and imagination offer immersive brand experiences and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns offering continual product innovation and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance and other products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products 

 

the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys and games to a wider array of entertainment products at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 

delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands or lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment media can harm our business 

 

as part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as many different forms and formats as possible entertainment media in forms such as motion pictures and television can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands and the success of such media efforts can significantly impact demand for our products and our financial success 

 

the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products and brands not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

similarly if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed in 2009 we entered into a joint venture with discovery communications inc “discovery” through that joint venture we are currently working with discovery to offer a children’s and family entertainment channel called the hub which is scheduled to debut in the fall of 2010 in connection with this joint venture effort we are also building a virtual studio called hasbro studios which will develop and produce entertainment media based on our brands lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of the hub programming appearing on the hub other programming developed by hasbro studios and products related to that programming could significantly harm our business similarly our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with the introduction of the rebranded joint venture network the development of hasbro studios and the creation of new content based on our brands to appear on the joint venture network and elsewhere 

 

at december 27 2009 371783 or 95 of our total assets represented our investment in the discovery joint venture if the launch of the rebranded television channel is not successful or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel then our investment may become impaired which could result in a writedown through net earnings 

 

economic downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

 

the success of our family entertainment products and our financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings 

 

recessions and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable income and lower consumer confidence any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance 

 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues decrease our operating margins increase our costs andor lower our profitability 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our business 

 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit rising fuel and raw material prices for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties for which we have a license such as marvel or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 27 2009 we had 120115 of prepaid royalties 43115 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77000 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 27 2009 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 331491 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing 

business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial performance 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 27 2009 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 42 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in fact over time we expect our international sales and operations to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved markets additionally as we discuss below we utilize 

thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations including operations in emerging markets that we have entered may enter or may increase our presence in are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net sales the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be significantly harmed by exchange rate movements 

 

the concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 27 2009 walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 25 13 and 11 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart target and toys “r” us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 54 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 74 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result in higher bad debt expense 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

 

we own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the people’s republic of china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control including natural disasters or pandemics our operations would be disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of supply were secured this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business 

 

given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in the people’s republic of china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports on the western coast of north america whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting china also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with the people’s republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions the global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition hasbro requires that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames and consumer electronics at younger and younger ages we have sought to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include our ibranded products such as idog and icat and our furreal friends 

line of products including butterscotch pony biscuit my lovin’ pup and kota these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games 

 

we rely on external financing including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011 which provides for a 300000 committed revolving credit facility which provides the company the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of 50000 subject to lender agreement up to a total of 500000 the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

 

as an additional source of working capital and liquidity we currently have a 250000 accounts receivable securitization program under this program we sell on an ongoing basis substantially all of our domestic us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity under this facility the special purpose entity is able to sell on a revolving basis undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits during the term of the facility we must maintain certain performance ratios if we fail to maintain these ratios we could be prevented from accessing this costeffective source of working capital and shortterm financing additionally changes in financial reporting regulatory or other requirements which went into effect in 2010 or may occur in the future may significantly increase the cost of our accounts receivable securitization facility which could make use of such a facility uneconomical 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility are adequate for current and planned needs in 2010 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility regulatory or accounting changes which make accounts receivable securitization facilities more expensive or otherwise less desirable as sources of working capital funding or other future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing 

although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 27 2009 we had 1134723 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all this total indebtedness includes 249828 in aggregate principal amount of 275 senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001 on december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations environmental regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 27 2009 we had 554567 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings in the case of our joint venture with discovery communications inc we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory 

investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment at december 27 2009 475931 or 122 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net earnings caused by the writedown of goodwill or our investment in the joint venture could harm our results of operations

executive summary 

 

the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products as well as through the outlicensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with noncompeting products including digital games offered by third parties the company sells its products both within the united states and in a number of international markets the company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year in 2009 2008 and 2007 the second half of the year accounted for 65 63 and 66 of the company’s net revenues respectively while many of the company’s products are based on brands the company owns or controls the company also offers products which are based on licensed rights from outside inventors in addition the company licenses rights to produce products based on movie television music and other entertainment properties owned by third parties such as the marvel and star wars properties 

 

the company’s business is separated into three principal business segments us and canada international and entertainment and licensing the us and canada segment develops markets and sells both toy and game products in the us and canada the international segment consists of the company’s european asia pacific and latin and south american marketing and sales operations the company’s entertainment and licensing segment includes the company’s lifestyle licensing digital gaming movie television and online entertainment operations in addition to these three primary segments the company’s worldwide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its global operations segment 

 

the company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas important to its consumers brand awareness is amplified through immersive traditional play digital applications publishing and lifestyle licensing and entertainment experiences presented for the consumers’ enjoyment the company’s focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights offering immersive entertainment experiences which allow consumers to experience the company’s brands across different forms and formats and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs increase operating profits and maintain a strong balance sheet the company’s core brands represent companyowned or companycontrolled brands such as transformers my little pony littlest pet shop monopoly magic the gathering playskool gi joe nerf and tonka which have been successful over the long term the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand by focusing on core brands the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth and to leverage profitability during 2009 the company had strong revenues from core brands namely transformers littlest pet shop nerf monopoly playskool playdoh magic the gathering and gi joe the company’s strategy of reimagining reinventing and reigniting its brands has been instrumental to achieving its overall longterm growth objectives 

 

the company also seeks to drive revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment as an example of this in june of 2009 the transformers revenge of the fallen motion picture was released as a sequel to the 2007 motion picture transformers  in addition in august 2009 the motion picture gi joe the rise of cobra was released the company developed and 

marketed product lines based on these motion pictures as a result of pairing these core brands with motion picture entertainment both the movies and the product lines benefited in addition the company has entered into a strategic relationship with universal pictures to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of hasbro’s core brands with the potential for production of two additional pictures the first movie is expected to be released in 2012 as part of its strategy in addition to using theatrical entertainment the company continues to seek opportunities to use other entertainment outlets and forms of entertainment as a way to build awareness of its brands which has proved instrumental to achieving its overall longterm growth objectives 

 

in april 2009 the company announced the entry into an agreement to form a joint venture with discovery communications inc “discovery” to create a television network in the united states dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming the transaction closed in may 2009 programming on the network will include content based on hasbro’s brands discovery’s library of children’s educational programming as well as programming developed by third parties the company expects the rebranded network the hub to debut in late fall of 2010 and believes that it will reach approximately 60 million homes in the us at that time with programming targeted to children 14 years of age and under the company believes that this effort will support its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond traditional toys and games and to provide immersive entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format in connection with this transaction the company has begun building an internal creative group that will be responsible for the creation and development of television programming based on hasbro’s brands the company expects to incur a certain level of investment spending leading up to the debut of the rebranded channel as well as costs in 2010 and beyond related to the production of television programming 

 

while the company believes it has built a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths the company’s primary licenses include its agreements with marvel characters bv “marvel” lucas licensing ltd “lucas” related to the star wars brand and sesame workshop related to the sesame street brand of characters the majority of product offerings under the sesame workshop license will commence in 2011 in 2009 and 2008 the company had significant sales of products related to the company’s license with marvel primarily due to the movie releases of iron man in may 2008 the incredible hulk in june 2008 and xmen origins wolverine in may 2009 in addition the company had significant sales in 2008 of products related to the movie release of star wars clone wars in august 2008 as well as sales from the movie release of indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull in may 2008 during 2009 the company has also had a high level of revenues from products related to television programming based on spiderman and star wars 

 

while gross profits of theatrical entertainmentbased products are generally higher than many of the company’s other products sales from these products including our owned or controlled brands based on a movie release also incur royalty expense such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins in certain instances such as with lucasfilm’s star wars the company may also incur amortization expense on property rightbased assets acquired from the licensor of such properties further impacting profits earned on these products 

 

the company’s longterm strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world as part of this strategy the company entered into a multiyear strategic agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” in 2007 the agreement gives ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on the company’s rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games for all platforms such as mobile phones gaming consoles and personal computers based on a broad spectrum of the company’s intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee nerf tonka gi joe and littlest pet shop a number of products under this agreement have been released in 2008 and 2009 and the line will continue to be updated and expanded in 2010 

 

the company is also investing to grow its business in emerging markets during the last two years the company expanded its operations in china brazil russia korea romania and the czech republic in

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

sales allowances 

 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

 

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2009 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value accordingly no impairment was indicated the company’s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and no impairments were indicated the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 27 2009 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 551669 recorded on the balance sheet 

 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or 

decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 478829 at december 27 2009 during 2009 the company wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately 6700 to reflect revised expectations for the related product lines 

 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

 

the company’s ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 27 2009 the company had 120115 of prepaid royalties 43115 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 77000 of which are included in other assets 

 

pension costs and obligations 

 

pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the estimates for the company’s us plans are established at the company’s measurement date the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 

 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on us plan assets used in the calculation of 2009 pension expense for the us plans was 850 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2009 pension expense for us plans by approximately 560 

 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2009 pension expense averaged 620 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2009 pension expense and the 2009 projected benefit obligation by approximately 343 and 8711 respectively 

 

actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 27 2009 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 81323 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 87906 at december 28 2008 the decrease primarily reflects amortization of these actuarial losses in 2009 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

stockbased compensation

the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans the blackscholes method includes four significant assumptions 1 expected term of the options 2 riskfree interest rate 3 expected dividend yield and 4 expected stock price volatility the weighted average expected terms used were approximately 4 years for the 2009 grant and approximately 5 years for the 2008 and 2007 stock option grants these amounts are based on a review of employees’ exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option the weighted average riskfree interest rates used for 2009 2008 and 2007 stock option grants were 187 271 and 479 respectively this estimate was based on the interest rate available on us treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option the weighted average expected dividend yields used for the 2009 2008 and 2007 stock option grants were 352 295 and 197 respectively which is based on the company’s current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant the weighted average expected stock price volatilities used were 36 for the 2009 stock option grant and 22 for the 2008 and 2007 stock option grants these amounts were derived using a combination of historical price volatility and current implied price volatility implied price volatility reflects the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the company’s common stock which the company believes represents the expected future volatility of the company’s stock price the company believes that since this is a marketbased estimate it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility the increase in the stock volatility assumption in 2009 reflects the increase in stock market volatility at the time of the company’s 2009 grant 

 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 as part of its employee stockbased compensation plan the company issued contingent stock performance awards which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the company’s common stock based on the company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended december 2011 december 2010 and december 2009 for the 2009 2008 and 2007 awards respectively each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets these awards are valued based on the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant and expensed over the performance period the measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the company’s current estimate of net revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above 

 

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 44200 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 27 2009 these contracts had unrealized gains of 22548 of which 8839 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 13709 are recorded in other assets included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 27 2009 are deferred gains of 20410 net of tax related to these derivatives 

 

at december 27 2009 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding fair value adjustments of 1134723 during the fourth quarter of 2009 the company entered into several interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 400000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt at december 27 2009 the fair value of these contracts was a liability of 2725 which is included in other liabilities with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease longterm debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 55100 or 50800 respectively a hypothetical onequarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease both 2009 pretax earnings and cash flows by 189 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 54 of its consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 52 of its consolidated net revenues in 2008 and 2007 in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2009 approximately 65 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year although the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year in 2009 the company had products related to the midyear major motion picture releases of transformers revenge of the fallen  gi joe the rise of cobra and xmen origins wolverine  in 2008 the company had products related to the midyear major motion picture releases of iron man  the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull  the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2009 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the fasb revised accounting standards related to the transfer of financial assets these revisions seek to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets the effects of a transfer on its financial position financial performance and cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement if any in transferred financial assets these revisions also eliminate the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity and require such entities to be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance the requirements of these revised accounting standards are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2009 as a result of the adoption of these new accounting standards in 2010 the company will account for all sales of accounts receivable under its securitization facility in 2010 as collateralized borrowings the accounts receivable balances will remain on the company’s balance sheet and proceeds from the sales of the receivables will be recorded as shortterm debt 

 

in june 2009 the fasb amended accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities these amendments require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity the amended standards also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity at december 27 2009 the company has an ownership interest in one variable interest entity the joint venture with discovery see the relevant discussion in note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements other than as discussed in note 5 the company does not expect the adoption of the amended standards to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet or results of operations

risk management contracts 

 

hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the business unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars euros and united kingdom pound sterling and are entered into with a number of counterparties all of which are major financial institutions the company believes that a default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

 

at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

notes to consolidated financial statements — continued 

thousands of dollars and shares except per share data 

 

the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the company’s foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies due to the shortterm nature of the derivative contracts involved the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts 

 

the company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific fixed rate longterm debt obligations and are designated as fair value hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt obligations these agreements are recorded at their fair value as an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts are included in the consolidated statements of operations and are wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt these hedges are considered to be perfectly effective under current accounting guidance the interest rate swap contracts are with a number of major financial institutions in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company believes that it is unlikely that any of its counterparties will be unable to perform under the terms of the contracts 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation

net earnings per common share 

 

basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year diluted net earnings per share is similar except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive securities and net earnings are adjusted for certain amounts related to dilutive securities dilutive securities include shares issuable under convertible debt as well as shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price less shares which could have been purchased by the company with the related proceeds dilutive securities during 2007 also may have included shares potentially issuable to settle liabilities options totaling 5784 3491 and 3250 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have been antidilutive

subsequent events 

 

in may 2009 the financial accounting standard board “fasb” established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued these standards require the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued the adoption did not have an impact on the company’s statements of operations or statement of financial position the company has evaluated all subsequent events that occurred through february 24 2010 the date the financial statements were issued

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion hasbro inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2009 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso

overview

organizationally our principal segments are us and canada and international both of these segments engage in the marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed above our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group we also have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and assists the segments in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments our us and canada segment covers the united states and canada while the international segment primarily includes europe the asia pacific region and latin and south america including mexico financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 16 to our financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

in addition our global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the us and canada and international segments and our other segment outlicenses our intellectual property to third parties on a worldwide basis including licensing of the company’s intellectual property for use in digital games 

 

us and canada 

 

the us and canada segment’s strategy is based on growing its core brands through innovation and reinvention introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses this strategy includes increasing visibility of the company’s core brands through entertainment such as motion pictures television and publishing major 2008 brands and products included star wars transformers littlest pet shop nerf playskool marvel products monopoly furreal friends magic the gathering and baby alive in the us and canada segment our products were organized into the following categories in 2008 i games and puzzles ii boys’ toys iii girls’ toys iv preschool toys v tween toys and vi other 

 

our games and puzzles category includes several well known brands including milton bradley parker brothers trivial pursuit cranium avalon hill and wizards of the coast these brand portfolios consist of a broad assortment of games for children tweens families and adults core game brands include monopoly battleship game of life scrabble chutes and 

ladders candy land trouble mousetrap operation hungry hungry hippos connect four twister yahtzee cranium jenga simon clue sorry risk boggle trivial pursuit and guess who as well as a line of puzzles for children and adults including the big ben and croxley lines of puzzles wizards of the coast offers trading card and roleplaying games including magic the gathering and dungeons  dragons we seek to keep our core brands relevant through sustained marketing programs as well as by offering consumers new ways to experience these brands in 2008 we acquired cranium inc which resulted in an extension of our core brand portfolio of games the cranium brand includes a range of products targeted to kids families and adults in addition we hope to increase the reach of our brands through our strategic alliance with electronic arts inc “ea” which expands our brands to a variety of new digital platforms 

 

our boys’ toys include a wide range of core brands such as gi joe and transformers action figures and accessories as well as entertainmentbased licensed products based on popular movie television and comic book characters such as star wars and marvel toys and accessories in the action figure area a key part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing the storyline associated with these products through the use of mediabased entertainment in 2008 sales in our boys’ toys category also benefited from major motion picture releases of ironman the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull in addition star wars spiderman and transformers products were supported by animated television series in 2009 the major motion pictures gi joe the rise of cobra and transformers revenge of the fallen are expected to be released based on our gi joe and transformers brands in addition the company expects product revenues from the 2009 release of the motion picture xmen origins wolverine based on the marvel character in addition to marketing and developing action figures for traditional play the company also develops and markets products designed for collectors which has been a key component of the success of the star wars brand 

 

in our girls’ toys category we seek to provide a traditional and wholesome play experience girls’ toys include littlest pet shop my little pony furreal friends and baby alive brands in 2009 we will seek to continue to grow and refresh the littlest pet shop brand through the introduction of new characters in addition in 2009 we plan to expand our presence in this category by introducing a full line of strawberry shortcake toys 

 

our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for infants and preschoolers in the various stages of development our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands marketed primarily under the playskool trademark the playskool line includes such wellknown products as mr potato head weebles sit ’n spin and gloworm along with a successful line of infant toys including step start walk n’ ride 2in1 tummy time gym and busy ball popper through our ages  stages system we seek to provide consumer friendly information that assists parents in understanding the developmental milestones their children will encounter as well as the role each playskool product can play in helping children to achieve these developmental milestones in addition our preschool category also includes the tonka line of trucks and interactive toys and the playdoh brand 

 

over the last several years our tweens toys category generally marketed products under the tiger and nerf brands and sought to target those children who have outgrown traditional toys the age group targeted by this category was generally 8 to 12 years old the major tweens toys product lines in 2008 were nerf and idog in recent years we have used our consumer insights and electronic innovation to develop a strong line of products focusing on this target audience however as consumer electronics have become more affordable to this age group this category has become less relevant as a result we have seen a reduction in demand for many tween electronic products as the target consumers have increasingly embraced adult consumer electronics we also have not achieved the profit margins on many of the tween electronic products which we considered necessary for that reason starting in 2009 we will no longer have a tweens product category however we do plan to continue to opportunistically offer electronic products which we believe can be successful items going forward those items will be offered under either our boys’ or girls’ categories for example starting in 2009 idog will be managed under the girls’ toys category in addition our nerf and 

super soaker products have been highly successful and starting in 2009 will be managed as part of the boys’ toys category 

 

international 

 

in addition to our business in the united states and canada our international segment sells a representative range of the toy and game products marketed in the us and canada segment as discussed above together with some items that are sold only internationally these products are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most countries in europe asia pacific and latin and south america and through distributors in those countries where we have no presence the products sold internationally are managed under the same categories as in the us and canada the major geographic regions included in the international segment are europe asia pacific and latin and south america including mexico in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america in 2008 we expanded our operations in brazil china russia the czech republic and korea key international brands for 2008 included littlest pet shop playskool transformers star wars monopoly my little pony and marvel 

 

other segments 

 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

 

through our other segment we generate revenue through the outlicensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings during 2008 our other segment outlicensed our brands primarily in apparel publishing home goods and electronics and certain brands in the digital area one of the primary goals of this segment is to further expand our brands into the digital world through strategic licenses as an example we have a longterm strategic licensing alliance with electronic arts inc “ea” which provides ea with the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all major platforms including mobile phones personal computers and game consoles such as xbox playstation and wii based on most of our toy and game intellectual properties the first games generated under this strategic alliance were introduced in 2008 with a full line expected in 2009 in 2009 the company expects its licensing revenues to be positively impacted by the major motion picture releases of gi joe rise of cobra and transformers revenge of the fallen 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell our toy and game products directly to retailers primarily on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2008 and 2006 fiscal years during the 2007 fiscal year revenues generated from transformers products were approximately 482000 which was 126 of our consolidated net revenues in 2007 no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2007 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from shortterm borrowings and our accounts receivable securitization program our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during the third quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season the strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half and within the second half of the year the fourth quarter is generally more predominant in 2008 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 63 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 32 and 31 of full year revenues respectively in years where the company has products tied to a major motion picture release such as in 2008 with the midyear releases of ironman the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull and in 2007 with the midyear releases of spiderman 3 and transformers this concentration may not be as pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the time of the motion picture theatrical release 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers unshipped orders at january 25 2009 and january 27 2008 were approximately 108000 and 149000 respectively it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year these programs follow general industry practices the types of programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2009 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 we increased our support of retailers as a result of the weak retail environment the company currently does not expect to have similar incremental promotional programs in 2009 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2008 we utilized cash from our operations borrowings under our secured amended and restated revolving credit agreements as well as our uncommitted lines of credit and proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program to meet our cash flow requirements 

 

royalties research and development 

 

our success is dependent on innovation including both the continuing development of new products and the redesign of existing products for continued market acceptance our toy game and puzzle products are developed by a global development group and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our operating segments in 2008 2007 and 2006 we spent 191424 167194 and 171358 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or 

modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2008 2007 and 2006 we incurred 312986 316807 and 169731 respectively of royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment royalty expense in 2008 and 2007 was more significant in those years as compared to 2006 due to the release of ironman the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull in 2008 and spiderman 3 and transformers in 2007 in addition royalty expense related to sales of star wars products were significant in both of these years 

 

marketing and sales 

 

as we are focused on reimagining reinventing and reigniting our many brands on a consistent global basis we have a global marketing function which establishes brand direction and messaging as well as assists the selling entities in establishing certain local marketing programs the costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers including over 1800 in the united states during 2008 there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2008 net revenues from our three largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc represented 25 12 and 10 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart target and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 71 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase certain of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows 

 

in 2008 we spent 454612 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 434742 in 2007 and 368996 in 2006 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2008 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price there are certain chemicals including phthalates and bpa that national state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of however we do not believe these restrictions will materially impact our business we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year however significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly the people’s republic of china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2009 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by the people’s republic of china or other factors which increase the cost of manufacturing in china such as higher chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the yuan could significantly disrupt our operations andor significantly increase the cost of the products which are manufactured in china and imported into other markets 

 

we purchase dies and molds from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies in our business we must deal with the phenomena that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

employees 

 

at december 28 2008 we employed approximately 5900 persons worldwide approximately 3200 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act as amended by the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 as amended the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in certain foreign markets such as canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa applicable international standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

forwardlooking information and risk factors that may affect future results 

 

from time to time including in this annual report on form 10k and in our annual report to shareholders we publish “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these “forwardlooking statements” may relate to such matters as our anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods expected technological and product developments the expected timing of new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers the timing of entertainment releases marketing and promotional efforts research and development activities liquidity and similar matters forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements these statements may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words or phrases such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “expect” “intend” “looking forward” “may” “planned” “potential” “should” “will” and “would” or any variations of words with similar meanings we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forwardlooking statements the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the securities and exchange commission such as on forms 8k 10q and 10k we undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report unless otherwise specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares except for per share amounts 

 

the volatility of consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success of existing products and product lines or introduce successful new products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

 

the family entertainment business is a fashion industry our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products principally games and toys our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the current preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our sales and profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and consumers could significantly lower our revenues and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is important to identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot” toys and games on children’s “wish lists” our continued success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys and games and license our brands for products which are sought after by both children and their parents we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the redesign and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance creates an environment in which products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the 

barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products 

 

the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 

 

similarly the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

economic downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers can harm our business and financial performance 

 

the success of our family entertainment products and our financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings 

 

recessions and other economic downturns or disruptions in credit markets in the markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity lower employment levels less consumer disposable 

income and lower consumer confidence any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products this in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance 

 

in addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products increase our promotional spending or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products those steps may lower our net revenues decrease our operating margins increase our costs andor lower our profitability 

 

other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate including rising commodity and fuel prices higher labor costs increased transportation costs outbreaks of sars or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products and lower our revenues margins and profitability 

 

various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our business 

 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline home heating fuels or groceries may reduce household spending on the discretionary entertainment products we offer as we discussed above weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our revenues and profitability 

 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for profitable revenues rising fuel and raw material prices for components such as resin used in plastics increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes an outbreak of sars or another severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product any of these factors could result in product delays increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties released theatrically for which we have a license such as marvel or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 28 2008 we had 71000 of prepaid royalties 44300 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 26700 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 28 2008 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 57818 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques these customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial performance 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 28 2008 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 42 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues additionally as we discuss below we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

if the exchange rate between the united states dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes our financial results reported in us dollars may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected as an example if the dollar appreciates 10 relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had 200 million of net sales the dollar value of those sales as they are translated into us dollars would decrease by 20 million in our consolidated financial results as such we would recognize a 20 million decrease in our net revenues even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed similarly our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted in us dollar terms by exchange rates meaning the profitability of our business in us dollar terms can be significantly harmed by exchange rate movements 

 

the consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 28 2008 walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 25 12 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart target and toys “r” us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net revenues in the us and canada segment approximately 71 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce 

the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could significantly harm our sales profitability and financial condition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 

 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

 

we own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the people’s republic of china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations would be disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of supply were secured this delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business 

 

given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in the people’s republic of china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in china out of asia and through the ports on the western coast of north america whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with the people’s republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions the global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition hasbro requires that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames and consumer electronics at younger and younger ages we have needed to work even harder to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of older children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include videonow chatnow zoombox our ibranded products such as idog and icat and our furreal friends line of products including butterscotch biscuit and kota these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter 

 

we rely on external financing including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011 which provides for a 300000 committed revolving credit facility which provides the company the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of 50000 subject to lender agreement up to a total of 500000 the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

 

as an additional source of working capital and liquidity we currently have a 250000 accounts receivable securitization program which is increased to 300000 for the period from fiscal october through fiscal january under this program we sell on an ongoing basis substantially all of our domestic us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity under this facility the special purpose entity is able to sell on a revolving basis undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits during the term of the facility we must maintain certain performance ratios if we fail to maintain these ratios we could be prevented from accessing this costeffective source of working capital and shortterm financing 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility are adequate for current and planned needs 

in 2009 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant in times of severe economic downturn andor distress in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us in such a situation it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 28 2008 we had 709723 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all this total indebtedness includes 249828 in aggregate principal amount of 275 senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001 on december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our net earnings 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 28 2008 we had 568412 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire or acquire an interest in in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired companies will allow us to more effectively market our products in some cases we expect that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable products or services in the future 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net earnings 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire current accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit at december 28 2008 approximately 474497 or 150 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net earnings caused by the writedown of goodwill could harm our results of operations

executive summary 

 

the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products as well as through the outlicensing of rights for use of its properties in connection with noncompeting products including digital games offered by third parties the company sells its products both within the united states and in a number of international markets the company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year in 2008 2007 and 2006 the second half of the year accounted for 63 66 and 68 of the company’s net revenues respectively while many of the company’s products are based on brands the company owns or controls the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors in addition the company licenses rights to produce products based on movie television music and other entertainment properties such as marvel and star wars properties 

 

the company’s business is primarily separated into two business segments us and canada and international the us and canada segment develops markets and sells both toy and game products in the us and canada the international segment consists of the company’s european asia pacific and latin and south american marketing operations including mexico in addition to these two primary segments the company’s worldwide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its global operations segment the company’s other segment is responsible for the worldwide outlicensing of the company’s intellectual properties and works closely with the us and canada and international segments on the development and outlicensing of the company’s brands prior to 2008 the company’s mexican operations were included with the us and canada in the north american segment at the beginning of 2008 the company reorganized the management and reporting structure of its operating segments and moved the mexican operations into the international segment and the north american segment was renamed the us and canada segment the management reorganization was the result of a realignment of the company’s commercial markets and reflects its objective to leverage its mexican operations in connection with its growth strategy in latin and south america 

 

the company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas important to its consumers brand awareness is amplified through immersive traditional play digital applications publishing and lifestyle licensing experiences presented for the consumers’ enjoyment the company’s focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet the company’s core brands represent companyowned or companycontrolled brands such as transformers my little pony littlest pet shop monopoly magic the gathering playskool gi joe nerf and tonka which have been successful over the long term the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand by focusing on core brands the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth during 2008 the company had strong sales of core brand products namely littlest pet shop transformers playskool monopoly nerf my little pony furreal friends and playdoh this strategy of reimagining reinventing and reigniting its brands has proved instrumental to achieving its overall growth objectives 

the company also seeks to drive productrelated revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment as an example of this in july of 2007 the transformers motion picture was released and the company developed and marketed products based on the motion picture as a result of pairing this core brand with this type of entertainment both the movie and the product line benefited the company expects to continue this strategy and anticipates the theatrical releases of both transformers revenge of the fallen and gi joe rise of cobra motion pictures during 2009 in addition the company has entered into a sixyear strategic relationship with universal pictures to produce at least four motion pictures based on certain of hasbro’s core brands the first movie is expected to be released in 2010 or 2011 followed by anticipated releases of at least one movie per year thereafter 

 

while the company believes it has achieved a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths in 2008 and 2007 the company had significant sales of products related to the company’s license with marvel characters bv “marvel” primarily due to the theatrical releases of iron man in may 2008 the incredible hulk in june 2008 and spiderman3 in may 2007 in addition the company had significant sales in 2008 of products related to the movie release of star wars clone wars in august 2008 as well as sales from the movie release of indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull in may 2008 during 2009 the company expects to continue to have a high level of revenues from entertainmentbased licensed properties based on the expected major motion picture release of xmen origins wolverine as well as products related to television programming based on spiderman and star wars 

 

while gross profits of theatrical entertainmentbased products are generally higher than many of the company’s other products sales from these products including our owned or controlled brands based on a movie release also incur royalty expense such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins in certain instances such as with lucasfilm’s star wars the company may also incur amortization expense on property rightbased assets acquired from the licensor of such properties further impacting profits earned on these products 

 

the company’s longterm strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world as part of this strategy the company entered into a multiyear strategic agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” the agreement gives ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on the company’s rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games for all platforms such as mobile phones gaming consoles and personal computers based on a broad spectrum of the company’s intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee nerf tonka gi joe and littlest pet shop the first major game releases under this agreement were released in 2008 with a full line expected in 2009 

 

while the company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business it also continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement over the last 6 years the company has improved its full year operating margin from 78 in 2002 to 123 in 2008 the company reviews it operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce its cost structure and promote efficiency the company is also investing to grow its business in emerging markets in 2008 the company expanded its operations in china brazil russia korea and the czech republic in addition the company is seeking to grow its business in entertainment digital gaming and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business for example in january of 2008 the company acquired cranium inc a developer and marketer of cranium branded games and related products in the second quarter of 2008 the company acquired the rights to trivial pursuit a brand which the company had previously licensed on a longterm basis ownership of the rights will allow the company to further leverage the brand in different media 

 

in recent years the company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as part of this initiative over the last four years the company’s board of directors 

the “board” has adopted four share repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of 1700000 after fully exhausting the prior three authorizations the fourth authorization was approved on february 7 2008 for 500000 for the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 the company spent 357589 587004 and 456744 respectively to repurchase 11736 20795 and 22767 shares respectively in the open market also in 2007 the company paid 200000 in cash to repurchase exercisable warrants for 15750 shares of the company’s common stock the company intends to at its discretion opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions at december 28 2008 the company had 252364 remaining under the february 2008 authorization 

 

after a very strong first nine months of 2008 the company was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 2008 by both the strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies as well as the broad based economic downturn that was experienced in most of the markets in which it operates the company worked with its retail customers to put certain promotional programs in place with the goal of both driving sales as well as managing inventory at retail given the weakening demand despite the impact of the economic conditions the company grew revenue in both the fourth quarter and for the full year absent the impact of foreign exchange rate changes in 2008 

 

recent issues in the credit markets have not materially impacted the company’s liquidity as of december 28 2008 the company had 630390 in cash and had available capacity if needed under its revolving credit agreement the company believes that the funds available to it including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2009

evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes

for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2008 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates made in prior years 

 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and no impairment was indicated the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 28 2008 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 550235 recorded on the balance sheet 

 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or 

decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 492674 at december 28 2008 during 2008 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

 

the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 28 2008 the company had 70982 of prepaid royalties 44329 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 26653 which are included in other assets

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on us plan assets used in the calculation of 2008 pension expense for the us plans was 875 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2008 pension expense for us plans by approximately 685 

 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2008 pension expense averaged 634 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2008 pension expense and the 2008 projected benefit obligation by approximately 165 and 7972 respectively 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 28 2008 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 87906 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 19158 at december 30 2007 the increase primarily reflects a decrease in the fair value of plan assets in 2008 pension

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 64500 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign revenues and costs the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 

 

the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 28 2008 these contracts had unrealized gains of 72053 of which 32203 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 39850 are recorded in other assets included in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 28 2008 are deferred gains of 63513 net of tax 

at december 28 2008 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 709723 the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 34300 or 30900 respectively 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 52 of its consolidated net revenues in 2008 and 2007 and 53 of its consolidated net revenues in 2006 in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2008 approximately 63 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year although the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year in 2008 the company had products related to the midyear major motion picture releases of ironman the incredible hulk and indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2008 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a twostep process that begins with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the remaining intangibles having defined lives are being amortized over periods ranging from five to twentyfive years primarily using the straightline method at december 28 2008 approximately 6 of other intangibles relate to rights acquired in connection with a major entertainment property and are being amortized over the contract life in proportion to projected sales of the licensed products during the same period

the components of earnings before income taxes determined by tax jurisdiction are as follows 

 

 

 

the components of deferred income tax expense arise from various temporary differences and relate to items included in the statements of operations the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 are 

 

 

 

hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at december 28 2008 of 11755 which is a decrease of 24499 from 36254 at december 30 2007 the valuation allowance pertains to united states and international loss carryforwards some of which have no expiration and others that would expire beginning in 2009 the decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the generation of sufficient capital gains in 2008 to utilize prior year capital losses 

 

based on hasbro’s history of taxable income and the anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions the company believes that it will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets net of the existing valuation allowance 

 

deferred income taxes of 53285 and 53040 at the end of 2008 and 2007 respectively are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and 53031 and 45855 respectively are included as a component of other assets at the same dates deferred income taxes of 4245 and 81 respectively are

a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits excluding potential interest and penalties for the fiscal years ended december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 is as follows 

 

 

 

if the 79456 is recognized approximately 54300 would decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which each of the benefits is recognized the remaining amount would be offset by the reversal of related deferred tax assets 

 

during 2008 and 2007 the company recognized 3357 and 4628 respectively of potential interest and penalties which are included as a component of income tax in the accompanying statement of operations at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 the company had accrued potential interest and penalties of 13660 and 12020 respectively 

 

the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the united states and various state and international jurisdictions in the normal course of business the company is regularly audited by us federal state and local and international tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions the company is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations for years before 2004 with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state or local and nonus income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2003 

 

the us internal revenue service has commenced an examination related to the 2004 and 2005 us federal income tax returns the company is also under income tax examination in mexico and in several other state and foreign jurisdictions the ultimate resolution of the us and mexican examinations including matters that may be resolved within the next twelve months is not yet determinable in connection with the mexican tax examinations for the years 2000 to 2003 the company has received tax assessments which include interest penalties and inflation updates related to transfer pricing which the company is vigorously defending in order to continue the process of defending its position the company was required to guarantee the amount of the assessments as is usual and customary in mexico with respect to these matters accordingly as of december 28 2008 bonds totaling 67696 at yearend 2008 exchange rates have been provided to the

mexican government related to the 2000 to 2002 assessments allowing the company to defend its positions the company will be required to either post an additional bond or pay a deposit of 25688 at yearend 2008 exchange rates related to the 2003 assessment the company expects to be successful in sustaining its position with respect to these assessments as well as similar positions that may be taken by the mexican tax authorities for periods subsequent to 2003 

 

upon the settlements of other examinations in various tax jurisdictions and the expiration of several statutes of limitation the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest may decrease income tax expense by up to approximately 3000 in the next 12 months 

 

the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of hasbro’s international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is approximately 718000 at december 28 2008 in the event that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to the united states the amount of incremental taxes would be approximately 167000

“sfas no 159” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 

 

the sfas no 157 fair value hierarchy consists of three levels level 1 fair values are valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access level 2 fair values are those valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and level 3 fair values are valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

 

sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities the company did not elect the fair value option for any assets or liabilities in 2008 the adoption of sfas no 157 and sfas no 159 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations sfas no 157 is not required to be adopted for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until the first day of fiscal 2009 the company’s assets for which sfas no 157 was not adopted include the company’s goodwill and property rights including the property rights recorded in connection with the company’s acquisition of cranium inc and trivial pursuit see note 4

for a portion of the company’s availableforsale securities the company is able to obtain quoted prices from stock exchanges to measure the fair value of these securities the remaining availableforsale securities consist of warrants to purchase common stock the company uses the blackscholes model to value these warrants one of the inputs used in the blackscholes model historical volatility is considered an unobservable input in that it reflects the company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company believes that this is the best information available for use in the fair value measurement the company’s derivatives are measured using inputs that are observable indirectly through corroboration with readily available market data in this case foreign exchange rates the company’s derivatives consist of foreign currency forward contracts the company uses current forward rates of the respective foreign currencies to measure the fair value of these contracts there were no changes in these valuation techniques during 2008

assumptions used to determine the yearend benefit obligation are as follows 

 

 

 

the assets of the funded plans are managed by investment advisors and consist of the following 

 

 

 

hasbro’s two major funded plans the “plans” are defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit structure established by hasbro inc the plans’ investment managers who exercise full investment discretion within guidelines outlined in the plans’ investment policy are charged with managing the assets with the care skill prudence and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar circumstance would exercise investment practices at a minimum must comply with the employee retirement income security act erisa and any other applicable laws and regulations 

 

the plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a longterm targeted total return consistent with the ongoing nature of the plans’ liabilities the shared longterm total return goal presently 875 includes income plus realized and unrealized gains andor losses on the plans’ assets utilizing generally accepted diversification techniques the plans’ assets in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level are invested so that the total portfolio risk exposure and riskadjusted returns best meet the plans’ longterm obligations to employees during 2007 the company reevaluated its investment strategy and as a result decided to change the asset allocation in order to more closely align changes in the value of plan assets with changes in the value of plan liabilities this change in asset allocation resulted in a transfer of assets into alternative investment strategies designed to achieve a modest absolute return in addition to the return on an underlying asset class such as bond or equity indices these alternative investment strategies may use derivatives to gain market returns in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives are not used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets these alternative investment strategies are included in other equity and fixed income asset categories at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 plan asset allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced to achieve target allocation among the asset categories when necessary 

 

the plans’ investment managers are provided specific guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to them in general investment managers are expected to remain fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of risk as related to investments in a single security portfolio turnover and credit quality

with the exception of the alternative investment strategies mentioned above the plans’ investment policy restricts the use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation in addition the investment policy also restricts investments in securities issued by hasbro inc except through indexrelated strategies eg an sp 500 index fund andor commingled funds in addition unless specifically approved by the investment committee which is comprised of members of management established by the board to manage and control pension plan assets certain securities strategies and investments are ineligible for inclusion within the plans 

 

as noted above in 2007 the company adopted the measurement date provision of sfas 158 and accordingly for 2008 and 2007 the plans’ assets and liabilities were measured at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 respectively for the fiscal year 2006 the company measured its liabilities and related assets at september 30 the discount rates used in the pension calculation were also used for the postretirement calculation 

 

 

 

assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost of the pension plan for each fiscal year follow 

 

 

 

hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to assist in the development of the longterm rate of return assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset allocation forecast returns are based on the combination of historical returns current market conditions and a forecast for the capital markets for the next 57 years all asset class assumptions are within certain bands around the longterm historical averages correlations are based primarily on historical return patterns

expected benefit payments under the defined benefit pension plans and expected gross benefit payments and subsidy receipts under the postretirement benefit for the next five years subsequent to 2008 and in the aggregate for the following five years are as follows 

 

 

 

assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the postretirement plan for the year to date periods are as follows 

 

 

 

if the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage point in each year the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 28 2008 and the aggregate of the benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would have increased by approximately 4 and 5 respectively

in fiscal 2009 the company expects amortization of 120 of prior service costs 680 of unrecognized net losses and 28 of unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost

addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america key international brands for 2007 included transformers littlest pet shop monopoly marvel my little pony and playskool 

 

other segments 

 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based whollyowned subsidiary operation for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing 

 

through our other segment we generate revenue through the outlicensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings during 2007 our hasbro products group outlicensed our brands primarily in apparel publishing home goods and electronics and certain brands in the digital area one of the primary goals of our licensing segment is to further expand our brands into the digital world through strategic licenses as an example in 2007 the company entered into a longterm strategic licensing alliance with electronic arts inc “ea” which provides ea with the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all platforms including mobile phones personal computers and game consoles such as xbox playstation and wii based on most of our toy and game intellectual properties the first games generated under this strategic alliance are expected to be introduced in 2008 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell our toy and game products directly to retailers primarily on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

during the 2007 fiscal year revenues generated from the sale of transformers products were approximately 482000 which was 126 of our consolidated net revenues in 2007 during the 2005 fiscal year revenues generated from the sale of star wars products produced under our license with lucas licensing and lucasfilm were approximately 494000 which was 16 of our consolidated net revenues in 2005 no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2007 or 2005 no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2006 fiscal year 

 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program and shortterm borrowings our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during the fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday shipping season the strategy of retailers has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect that retailers will continue to follow this strategy our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half and within the second half of the year the fourth quarter is more predominant in 2007 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 66 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 32 and 34 of full year revenues respectively in years where the company has products tied to a major motion picture release such as in 2007 

with the midyear releases of spiderman 3 and transformers and in 2005 with the midyear release of star wars iii revenge of the sith this concentration is not as pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the time of the motion picture theatrical release 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers unshipped orders at january 27 2008 and january 28 2007 were approximately 149000 and 192000 respectively it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year these programs follow general industry practices the programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2008 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2007 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2007 we utilized cash from our operations proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under our secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements in addition to the above sources of cash in september 2007 we issued 350000 of notes that are due in 2017 the “notes” the proceeds from the notes were primarily used to repay our shortterm borrowings while the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

 

royalties research and development 

 

our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing development of new products and the redesign of existing products for continued market acceptance in 2007 2006 and 2005 we spent 167194 171358 and 150586 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2007 2006 and 2005 we incurred 316807 169731 and 247283 respectively of royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending upon the timing of movie releases 

and other entertainment royalty expense in 2007 and 2005 was more significant in those years due to the release of spiderman 3 and transformers in 2007 and star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in 2005 and the corresponding increases in sales of the related products in those years 

 

marketing and sales 

 

our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence while we have thousands of customers including over 2000 in the united states during 2007 there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry which we expect to continue as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2007 sales to our three largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc represented 24 12 and 11 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers including walmart target and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net revenues in the north american segment approximately 70 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase many of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february as well as at other international toy shows 

 

in 2007 we spent 434742 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 368996 in 2006 and 366371 in 2005 

 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2007 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year for this reason we are generally insulated in the shortterm from increases in the prices of raw materials however severe increases in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly the people’s republic of china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2008 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by the people’s republic of china could significantly disrupt our operations and increase the cost of our products imported into the united states or europe 

 

we purchase dies and molds from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies in our business we must deal with the phenomena that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

 

employees 

 

at december 30 2007 we employed approximately 5900 persons worldwide approximately 3300 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easybake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn 

an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada australia and europe we utilize laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa international standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

forwardlooking information and risk factors that may affect future results 

 

from time to time including in this annual report on form 10k and in our annual report to shareholders we publish “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these “forwardlooking statements” may relate to such matters as our anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods expected technological and product developments the expected timing of new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers the timing of entertainment releases marketing and promotional efforts research and development activities liquidity and similar matters forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements these statements may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words or phrases such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “expect” “intend” “looking forward” “may” “planned” “potential” “should” “will” and “would” or any variations of words with similar meanings we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forwardlooking statements the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the securities and exchange commission such as on forms 8k 10q and 10k we undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report unless otherwise specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares except for per share amounts 

the volatility of consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success of existing products and product lines or consistently introduce successful new products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

 

the family entertainment business is a fashion industry our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products principally games and toys our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the current preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our sales and profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and consumers could significantly lower our sales and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is important to identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot” toys and games on children’s “wish lists” our continued success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys games and children’s electronic products which are sought after by both children and their parents we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the redesign and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance creates an environment in which products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties generally and high technology products in particular often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products 

 

the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties released theatrically for which we have a license such as marvel or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues and profitability if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued similarly the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season this seasonality is exacerbated as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques these customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season 

in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

 

the consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 30 2007 walmart stores inc target corporation and toys “r” us inc accounted for approximately 24 12 and 11 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart target and toys “r” us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net revenues in the north american segment approximately 70 of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could harm our sales profitability and financial condition increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various entertainment properties and theatrical releases such as those based upon marvel or star wars characters the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 30 2007 we had 137959 of prepaid royalties 94616 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 43343 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 30 2007 we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 87815 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our use of thirdparty manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products as well as certain other products presents risks to our business 

 

we own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities one in east longmeadow massachusetts and the other in waterford ireland however most of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured by thirdparty manufacturers most of whom are located in the people’s republic of china although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations would be disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of supply were secured this delay could significantly reduce our sales and profitability and harm our business 

 

given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by thirdparty manufacturers located in the people’s republic of china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in the far east out of the far east and through the ports on the western coast of north america whether due to port congestion labor disputes product regulations andor inspections or other factors also the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the united states or the european union against products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with the people’s republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business additionally the suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by government inspectors in china could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales 

 

we require our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with our global business ethics principles which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions the global business ethics principles address a number of issues including working hours and compensation health and safety and abuse and discrimination in addition hasbro requires that our products supplied by thirdparty manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold hasbro has the right both directly and through the use of outside monitors to monitor compliance by our thirdparty manufacturers with our global business ethics principles and other manufacturing requirements in addition we do quality assurance testing on our products including products manufactured for us by third parties notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them there is always a risk that one or more of our thirdparty manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such noncompliance any failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with labor consumer product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us 

 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 30 2007 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 42 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues additionally as we discussed above we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

 11 

 

  

because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

market conditions including commodity and fuel prices public health conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact our revenues margins and our other business initiatives 

 

economic and public health conditions including factors that impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand or our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and costeffective manner can have a significant impact on our business the success of our family entertainment products is dependent on consumer purchasing of those products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings 

 

significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline and home heating fuels may reduce household spending on discretionary entertainment products we offer in addition weakened economic conditions lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce purchases of our products economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our sales and profitability 

 

our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for profitable sales rising fuel and raw material prices for components such as resin used in plastics increased transportation costs and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase our costs for producing and transporting our products which in turn may reduce our margins reduce our profitability and harm our business 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or alter our actions and reduce actual results for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product resulting in increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result increasing sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames and consumer electronics at younger and younger ages we have needed to work even harder to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include videonow chatnow zoombox our ibranded products such as idog and icat and our furreal friends line of products including butterscotch these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations including in the united states under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration or similar international authorities while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations 

 

governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations in addition one or more of our customers might require changes in our products such as the nonuse of certain materials in the future complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business similarly increased penalties for noncompliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations such increased costs or penalties could harm our business 

 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can 

be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our income 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet as of december 30 2007 we had approximately 486232 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few years acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in some cases we expect that the integration of the product lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services 

 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements 

we rely on external financing including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility to help fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a fiveyear revolving credit agreement which provides for a 300000 committed revolving credit facility which provides the company the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of 50000 up to a total of 500000 the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

 

as an additional source of working capital and liquidity we currently have a 250000 accounts receivable securitization program which is increased to 300000 for the period from fiscal october through fiscal january under this program we sell on an ongoing basis substantially all of our domestic us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity under this facility the special purpose entity is able to sell on a revolving basis undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits during the term of the facility we must maintain certain performance ratios if we fail to maintain these ratios we could be prevented from accessing this costeffective source of working capital and shortterm financing 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility are adequate for current and planned needs in 2008 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 30 2007 we had 844815 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding of which 135092 is due in july 2008 if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all this total indebtedness includes 249828 in aggregate principal amount of 275 senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001 on december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided 

that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net income 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire current accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit at december 30 2007 approximately 471177 or 146 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net income caused by the writedown of goodwill could harm our results of operations

executive summary 

 

the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products as well as through the outlicensing of its properties for use in connection with noncompeting products offered by third parties the company sells its products both within the united states and in a number of international markets the company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year and within that half the fourth quarter in 2007 66 of the company’s net revenues were generated in the second half of the year with 34 of annual net revenues generated in the fourth quarter in 2006 and 2005 percentages were 68 and 67 for the second half respectively and comparable at 35 for the fourth quarter while many of the company’s products are based on brands the company owns or controls the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors in addition the company licenses rights to produce products based on movie television music and other entertainment properties such as marvel and star wars properties 

 

the company’s business is primarily separated into two business segments north america and international the north american segment develops markets and sells both toy and game products in the us mexico and canada the international segment consists of the company’s european asia pacific and latin america marketing operations in addition to these two primary segments the company’s worldwide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its global operations segment the hasbro products group is responsible for the worldwide outlicensing of the company’s intellectual properties and works closely with the north american and international segments on the development and outlicensing of the company’s brands 

 

the company’s focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet while the company believes it has achieved a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths in 2007 the company had significant sales of products related to the company’s license with marvel entertainment inc and marvel characters inc collectively “marvel” primarily due to the theatrical release of spiderman3 in may of 2007 given the strength of its core brands the company may also seek to drive productrelated revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainmentbased theatrical venues as an example of this in july of 2007 the transformers motion picture was released and the company developed and marketed products based on the motion picture as a result of pairing this core brand with this type of entertainment both the movie and the product line benefited net revenues during 2007 related to the transformers line of products totaled approximately 482000 or 126 of consolidated net revenues 

 

the company’s core brands represent companyowned or company–controlled brands such as transformers my little pony monopoly magic the gathering playskool gi joe and tonka which have been successful over the long term the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand by focusing on core brands the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth in 2007 the company had strong sales of core brand products namely transformers littlest pet shop my little pony playskool monopoly nerf and playdoh 

in addition to its focus on core brands the company’s strategy also involves trying to meet everchanging consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 

 

while the company’s strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative new products it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the company believes it is economically attractive in 2006 the company entered into a license with marvel to produce toys and games based on marvel’s portfolio of characters the company had significant sales of products related to this license during 2007 primarily due to the theatrical release of spiderman 3 in may of 2007 the company has also incurred royalties on products based on the theatrical release of transformers in july 2007 while gross profits of theatrical entertainmentbased products are generally higher than many of the company’s other products sales from these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins in certain instances such as with lucasfilm’s star wars the company may also incur amortization expense on property rightbased assets acquired from the licensor of such properties further impacting profit made on these products 

 

the company’s longterm strategy also focuses on extending its brands further into the digital world as part of this strategy in august 2007 the company announced a multiyear strategic agreement with electronic arts inc “ea” the agreement gives ea the exclusive worldwide rights subject to existing limitations on the company’s rights and certain other exclusions to create digital games for all platforms such as mobile phones gaming consoles and personal computers based on a broad spectrum of the company’s intellectual properties including monopoly scrabble yahtzee nerf tonka and littlest pet shop as part of this agreement the company has also obtained the rights to create toys and nondigital games based on ea’s intellectual properties the first games under this agreement are expected to launch in 2008 

 

while the company remains committed to investing in the growth of its business it continues to be focused on reducing fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement over the last 5 years the company has improved its operating margin from 78 in 2002 to 135 in 2007 the company reviews it operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce its cost structure in an efficient manner in 2006 the company announced a reduction of its manufacturing activity in ireland and transition of the manufacture of certain products to the company’s suppliers in china and recently the company announced a restructuring of its games manufacturing facility in the us that is also expected to result in work practice efficiencies and cost reductions the company is also investing to grow its business in emerging international markets and will continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business for example in january of 2008 the company acquired cranium inc which develops and markets a wide range of cranium branded games and related products in 2008 the company expects to leverage revenue to offset the impact of these investments on its operating margins 

 

in recent years the company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as part of this initiative over the last three years the company’s board of directors the “board” has adopted three repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of 1200000 after fully exhausting the prior two authorizations the third authorization was passed on august 2 2007 for 500000 during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 390399 of common stock was repurchased under this authorization for the years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 the company invested 587004 456744 and 48030 respectively in the repurchase of 20795 22767 and 2386 shares respectively in the open market also in may of 2007 the company paid 200000 in cash to repurchase exercisable warrants to purchase 15750 shares of the company’s common stock subsequent to december 30 2007 the board approved an additional 500000 share repurchase authorization the company intends to opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions in addition in february 2008 the company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to 020 per share this was the fifth consecutive year that the board has increased the dividend

north america 

 

north american segment net revenues for the year ended december 30 2007 increased 15 to 2460016 from 2130290 in 2006 the impact of foreign currency translation on north american segment net revenues in 2007 was favorable primarily due to the strength of the mexican peso and canadian dollar and increased net revenues by approximately 4800 the increase was due primarily to increased revenues in the boys’ toys category driven by sales of marvel and transformers products due to the theatrical releases of spiderman 3 in may 2007 and transformers in july 2007 although star wars product sales declined in 2007 from 2006 sales of these products have continued to be a significant contributor to boys’ toys revenues in 2007 revenues in the girls’ toys category increased as a result of higher sales of littlest pet shop and furreal friends products as well as higher revenues from the baby alive line which was reintroduced in the second quarter of 2006 to a lesser extent revenues in the girls’ toys category were positively impacted by increased shipments of my little pony products girls’ toys revenues were negatively impacted by decreased sales of easybake oven products due to the recall of the product in july of 2007 revenues from the preschool category were flat for 2007 revenue from games and puzzles decreased slightly due to lower revenues from trading card and plug and play games partially offset by increased sales of traditional board games revenues from the tweens category decreased as a result of lower sales of electronic products such as videonow zoombox and idog partially offset by increased sales of nerf products revenues in 2007 were also positively impacted by increased sales of tooth tunes 

 

north american operating profit increased to 318737 in 2007 from 275959 in 2006 operating profit in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately 1500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the us dollar the increase in operating profit is primarily the result of higher gross profits resulting from the higher revenues discussed above although north american gross profit increased as a result of higher revenues this increase in gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately 10400 of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to the july 2007 easybake oven recall the increase in gross profit was also partially offset by higher royalty expense as the result of the increased sales of marvel and transformers movierelated products operating profit was also impacted by higher advertising expense as well as higher selling and distribution costs related to the increased sales volume in addition north american operating profit included increased investment spending in an online initiative of the company’s wizards of the coast operation 

 

north american segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 4 to 2130290 from 2038556 in 2005 the impact of foreign currency translation on north american segment net revenues in 2006 was favorable and increased net revenues by approximately 3200 anticipated decreased revenues of star wars products were more than offset primarily by increased sales of littlest pet shop playskool nerf idog and monopoly products as well as revenues from the successful reintroduction of baby alive revenues in 2006 were also positively impacted to a lesser extent by increased sales of playdoh and transformers products star wars revenues were significant in 2005 due to the 

theatrical and dvd releases of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith and remained strong in 2006 

 

north american segment operating profit increased to 275959 in 2006 from 165676 in 2005 the increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased gross profit as a result of the increased sales in 2006 as well as decreases in royalty and amortization expense principally due to the decrease in sales of star wars products operating profit for the north american segment was negatively impacted by higher research and product development costs due to higher investments in the playskool line and costs related to marvel products introduced in 2007 north american operating profit was negatively impacted in 2005 by a loss of approximately 23000 in the electronic games category which included charges associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play games 

 

international 

 

international segment net revenues for the year ended december 30 2007 increased by 33 to 1278589 from 959319 in 2006 in 2007 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately 88500 as a result of a weaker us dollar although international revenues increased in all categories the largest increase in net revenues was in the boys’ toys category as in the north american segment this increase was driven by higher sales of transformers products resulting from the theatrical release of the transformers movie in most countries in july of 2007 and marvel products resulting from the theatrical release of spiderman 3 in may of 2007 increased revenues in the girls’ toys category were principally the result of increased sales of littlest pet shop products and to a lesser extent my little pony products revenues in the preschool category were higher in 2007 based on increased sales of playskool products partially due to strong revenues of in the night garden in the united kingdom revenues in the games and puzzles category increased primarily due to increased sales of monopoly revenues from the tweens category increased primarily as a result of sales of the power tour guitar which was introduced in 2007 

 

international segment operating profit increased 75 to 158846 in 2007 from 90893 in 2006 operating profit for the segment in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately 10400 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the us dollar the remaining increase in operating profit is due to the higher revenues discussed above the increased gross profit as a result of the higher revenues was partially offset by higher royalty expense due to higher sales of marvel and transformers products as well as higher advertising and selling distribution and administration expenses 

 

international segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 decreased by 3 to 959319 from 988591 in 2005 in 2006 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation by approximately 24300 as a result of a weaker us dollar the decrease in net revenues was primarily the result of decreased sales of star wars products in 2006 as well as decreased sales of furby and duel masters products these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from littlest pet shop playskool and monopoly products to a lesser extent 2006 net revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of my little pony transformers and playdoh products as well as the reintroduction of the baby alive doll 

 

international segment operating profit decreased 15 to 90893 in 2006 from 106435 in 2005 operating profit for the segment in 2006 was positively impacted by approximately 4900 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the us dollar the decrease in operating profit was the result of decreased gross profit primarily as a result of the decrease in net revenues partially offset by decreases in royalties and amortization expense as a result of the decrease in sales of star wars products

the estimates for the company’s us plans are established at the company’s measurement date prior to 2007 the company used september 30 as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas no 158” which the company adopted in december of 2006 the company changed its measurement date in 2007 to its fiscal yearend date in accordance with this the liabilities and assets of the plans were remeasured as of december 31 2006 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of this remeasurement 

 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on us plan assets was 875 in 2007 2006 and 2005 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2007 pension expense for us plans by approximately 660 

 

expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical and expected compensation increases based on this analysis the company’s estimate of expected longterm compensation increases for its us plans was 40 in 2007 2006 and 2005 increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 

 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits based on this longterm corporate bond yield at december 30 2007 the company’s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities the company’s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense averaged 583 compared to a rate of 550 used in the calculation of 2006 pension expense and 575 used in the calculation of 2005 pension expense a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2007 pension expense and the 2007 projected benefit obligation by approximately 744 and 7779 respectively 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods at december 30 2007 the company’s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 19158 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date changes in the fair market value of plan assets may impact the amount of future pension expense during 2007 there were not significant declines in the fair value of pension plan assets as of december 30 2007 the company froze benefits under its largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

the company has a stockbased compensation plan for employees and nonemployee members of the company’s board of directors under this plan the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the company’s stock as well as restricted stock restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards on december 26 2005 the first day of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r which requires the company to measure all stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 

 

the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans the blackscholes method includes four significant assumptions 1 expected term of the options 2 riskfree interest rate 3 expected dividend yield and 4 expected stock price volatility for the company’s 2007 and 2006 stock option grants the weighted average expected term was approximately 5 years this amount is based on a review of employees’ exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option the weighted average riskfree interest rates used for 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 479 and 498 respectively this estimate was based on the interest rate available on us treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option the weighted average expected dividend yields used for the 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 197 and 255 respectively which is based on the company’s current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant the weighted average expected stock price volatilities used for 2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 22 and 24 respectively these amounts were derived using a combination of current and historical implied price volatility implied price volatility represents the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the company’s stock which the company believes represents the expected future volatility of the company’s stock price the company believes that since this is a marketbased estimate it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility 

 

in 2007 and 2006 as part of its employee stockbased compensation plan the company issued contingent stock performance awards which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the company’s common stock based on the company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended december 2009 for the 2007 award and over a ten quarter period beginning july 3 2006 and ending december 2008 for the 2006 award each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets these awards are valued based on the fair market value of the company’s stock on the date of the grant the measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the company’s current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards 

 

income taxes 

 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities 

are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 

 

an estimated effective tax rate is applied to the company’s quarterly operating results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company’s quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time changes in the company’s estimated effective tax rate during 2007 were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction as well as the company’s decision to repatriate a portion of 2007 international earnings to the us in addition changes in judgment related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2007 the company recorded a total benefit of 29999 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related reversal of interest 

 

in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the company’s tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the company’s tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected on the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company’s income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future credits deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company’s tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company’s financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized on the company’s tax return during 2007 the mexican government instituted a tax structure which will result in companies paying the higher of an incomebased tax or an alternative flat tax commencing in 2008 should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized as the company believes that it will be subject to the incomebased tax in 2008 it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable should the facts and circumstances change the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations which may result in additional tax expense 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 844815 in principal amount of longterm debt outstanding at december 30 2007 excluding fair value adjustments future payments required under these and other obligations as of december 30 2007 are as follows 

 

 

at december 30 2007 the company has a liability including potential interest and penalties of 70571 for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company does not know the ultimate resolution of these liabilities and as such does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability 

 

included in the thereafter column above is 249828 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021 the holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the company in december 2011 and december 2016 at the principal amount at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two in addition at december 30 2007 these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial conversion price of 2160 per share through march 31 2008 at which time the requirements of the contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated if the company’s stock exceeds 2376 for at least 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter or upon other specified events the debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price of 2160 

 

the company’s agreement with marvel provides for minimum guaranteed royalty payments and requires the company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities the future minimum contractual payments include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of 35000 payable to marvel in 2010 that are contingent upon the theatrical release of spiderman 4 

 

in addition the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 9200 to its pension plans in 2008 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 70000 at december 30 2007 

 

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 52400 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 30 2007 these contracts had unrealized losses of 10437 of which 6679 are recorded in accrued liabilities and 3758 recorded in other liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 30 2007 are deferred losses of 11080 net of tax 

 

at december 30 2007 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding fair value adjustments of 844815 at december 30 2007 the company had fixedforfloating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 75000 the interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt at 

december 30 2007 these contracts had a fair value of 256 which was included in other current assets with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase the current portion of longterm debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 39500 or 35400 respectively a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2008 pretax earnings and cash flows by 379 and 379 respectively 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top 5 customers all retailers accounted for approximately 52 53 and 53 of its consolidated net revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2007 approximately 66 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year although the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year in 2007 the company had products related to two major motion picture releases spiderman 3 in may of 2007 and transformers in july of 2007 the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2007 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

risk management contracts 

 

hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected future foreign currency transactions these overthecounter contracts which hedge future purchases of inventory and other crossborder currency requirements not denominated in the functional currency of the unit are primarily denominated in united states and hong kong dollars euros and united kingdom pound sterling and are entered into with counterparties who are major financial institutions the company believes that any default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company hasbro does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

 

at the inception of the contracts hasbro designates its derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions all hedges designated as cash flow hedges are linked to forecasted transactions and the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative if any is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

 

the company records all derivatives such as foreign currency exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations the company’s foreign currency contracts hedging anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in aoce until the forecasted transaction occurs at which time it is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations to the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the event hedge accounting requirements are not met gains and losses on such instruments are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations the company uses derivatives to economically hedge intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies due to the shortterm nature of the derivative contracts involved the company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts 

 

the company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt obligations and are designated and effective as fair value hedges of the change in fair value of those debt obligations these

agreements are recorded at their fair value as an asset or liability gains and losses on these contracts are included currently in the consolidated statements of operations and are wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt these hedges are considered to be perfectly effective under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 collectively “sfas 133” the interest rate swap contracts are with major financial institutions in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company believes that any default by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company

a reconciliation of the statutory united states federal income tax rate to hasbro’s effective income tax rate is as follows 

 

 

 

during 2007 the company designated 90000 of current year international net earnings that will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us the incremental income tax on this amount representing the difference between the us federal income tax rate and the income tax rates in the applicable international jurisdictions is a component of deferred income tax expense

the components of deferred income tax expense arise from various temporary differences and relate to items included in the statements of operations the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 are 

 

 

 

hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at december 30 2007 of 36254 which is an increase of 8446 from 27808 at december 31 2006 the valuation allowance pertains to united states and international loss carryforwards some of which have no expiration and others that would expire beginning in 2008 the increase in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the additional deferred tax assets related to potential capital losses if the operating loss carryforwards are fully realized 158 will reduce goodwill and the balance will reduce future income tax expense 

 

based on hasbro’s history of taxable income and the anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions it believes that it will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets net of the existing valuation allowance 

 

deferred income taxes of 53040 and 83854 at the end of 2007 and 2006 respectively are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and 45855 and 66276 respectively are included as a component of other assets at the same dates deferred income taxes of 81 and 122 respectively are included as a component of accrued liabilities and 1683 and 1839 respectively are included as a component of other liabilities 

 

on january 1 2007 the company adopted fin 48 which applies to all tax positions accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the

financial statements the second step determines the measurement of the tax position fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of such tax positions classification potential interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure the adoption of fin 48 resulted in a 88798 decrease in current liabilities a 85773 increase in longterm liabilities a 5333 increase to the longterm deferred tax assets and a 8358 increase to retained earnings 

 

a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits excluding potential interest and penalties for the fiscal year ended december 30 2007 is as follows 

 

 

 

if the 58855 is recognized approximately 51500 would decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which each of the benefits is recognized of the remaining amount 5700 would reduce intangible assets while the remainder would be offset by the reversal of related deferred tax assets 

 

during 2007 the company recognized 4628 of potential interest and penalties which are included as a component of income tax in the accompanying statement of operations at december 30 2007 the company had accrued potential interest and penalties of 12020 

 

the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the united states and various state and international jurisdictions in the normal course of business the company is regularly audited by us federal state and local and international tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions the company is no longer subject to us federal tax examinations for years before 2004 with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state or local and nonus income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2002 of the 27321 of decreases related to expirations of statutes of limitations noted above 26982 relates to the recently completed examinations of the 2002 and 2003 us federal income tax returns including the reversal of 7710 of potential interest the company recognized 34692 of previously unrecognized tax benefits during 2007 primarily related to the deductibility of certain expenses and tax treatment of certain subsidiary and other transactions of this amount 29619 was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 2932 was recorded as a reduction of deferred tax assets and 2141 was recorded as a decrease to other intangibles 

 

the us internal revenue service has recently commenced an examination related to the 2004 and 2005 us federal income tax returns the company is also under income tax examination in mexico and in several other state and foreign jurisdictions the ultimate resolution of the us and mexican examinations including matters that may be resolved within the next twelve months is not yet determinable upon the settlements of other examinations in various tax jurisdictions and the expiration of several statutes of limitation the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest may decrease by up to approximately 3500 in the next 12 months 

 

the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of hasbro’s international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is approximately 744000 at december 30 2007 in the event that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to the united states the amount of incremental taxes would be approximately 154000

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas no 158” which amends statements of financial accounting standards no 87 88 106 and 132r under sfas no 158 the company is required to recognize on its balance sheet actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included in income as an adjustment of equity through other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to prepaid pension expense or the accrued pension liability in addition within two years of adoption the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities would be required to be the company’s fiscal year end the recognition provisions of sfas no 158 were effective for the company in the fourth quarter of 2006 the effect of this statement in 2006 on the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans was an increase in accrued pension liability of 36287 a decrease in intangible assets of 3108 an increase in deferred tax assets of 12645 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax of 26750

expense related to the company’s defined benefit and defined contribution plans for 2007 2006 and 2005 were approximately 25900 31100 and 28800 respectively of these amounts 13400 15400 and 13900 related to defined contribution plans in the united states and certain international affiliates the remainder of the expense relates to defined benefit plans discussed below 

 

united states plans 

 

substantially all united states employees are covered under at least one of several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans maintained by the company benefits under the two major plans which principally cover nonunion employees are based primarily on salary and years of service one of these major plans is funded benefits under the remaining plans are based primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service of these remaining plans the plan covering union employees is also funded 

 

in 2007 for the two major plans covering its nonunion employees the company froze benefits being accrued effective december 30 2007 in connection with this the company recognized a reduction of its projected benefit obligation as a result of this curtailment of 18499 and recorded a curtailment loss of 908 the pension benefit will be replaced by additional employer contributions to the company’s defined contribution plan beginning in 2008 

 

at december 30 2007 the measurement date the fair value of the plan assets of the funded plans were in excess of those plans’ benefit obligations while the unfunded plans of the company had an aggregate accumulated and projected benefit obligation of 45052 at september 30 2006 all individual plans had projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of each plan’s assets 

 

hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or age 55 with 10 years of service the cost of providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by the company the cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee the plan is not funded as noted above in 2007 the company adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas no 158 

 

reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances for the year ended december 30 2007 the transition period related to the change in measurement date referred to above and for the year ended december 31 2006 for the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are included below

assumptions used to determine the yearend benefit obligation are as follows 

 

 

 

the assumptions used to remeasure the benefit obligation using a december 31 2006 measurement date as well as those used to determine the expense for the transition period were not significantly different than the 2006 assumptions 

 

the assets of the funded plans are managed by investment advisors and consist of the following 

 

 

 

hasbro’s two major funded plans the “plans” are defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit structure established by hasbro inc the plans’ investment managers who exercise full investment discretion within guidelines outlined in the plans’ investment policy are charged with managing the assets with the care skill prudence and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar circumstance would exercise investment practices at a minimum must comply with the employee retirement income security act erisa and any other applicable laws and regulations 

 

the plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a longterm targeted total return consistent with the ongoing nature of the plans’ liabilities the shared longterm total return goal presently 875 includes income plus realized and unrealized gains andor losses on the plans’ assets utilizing generally accepted diversification techniques the plans’ assets in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level are invested so that the total portfolio risk exposure and riskadjusted returns best meet the plans’ longterm liabilities to employees in 2007 the company reevaluated its investment strategy and as a result decided to change the asset allocation in order to more closely align changes in the value of plan assets with changes in the value of plan liabilities this change in strategy resulted in a transfer of assets into alternative investments designed to achieve a modest absolute return in addition to the return on an underlying asset class such as bond or equity indices these alternative investments may use derivatives to gain market returns in an efficient and timely manner however derivatives are not used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets these alternative investments are included in other equity and fixed income at december 30 2007 plan asset allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced to achieve target allocation among the asset categories when necessary 

 

the plans’ investment managers are provided specific guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to them in general investment managers are expected to remain fully invested in their asset class

with further limitations of risk as related to investments in a single security portfolio turnover and credit quality 

 

with the exception of the alternative investment strategy mentioned above the plans’ investment policy restricts the use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation in addition the investment policy also restricts investments in securities issued by hasbro inc except through indexrelated strategies eg an sp 500 index fund andor commingled funds in addition unless specifically approved by the investment committee which is comprised of members of management established by the board to manage and control pension plan assets certain securities strategies and investments are ineligible for inclusion within the plans 

 

as noted above in 2007 the company adopted the measurement date provision of sfas 158 and accordingly measured its liabilities and related assets at december 30 prior to this the company measured its liabilities and related assets at september 30 the discount rates used in the pension calculation were also used for the postretirement calculation 

 

 

 

assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost of the pension plans for each fiscal year follow 

 

 

 

hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to assist in the development of the longterm rate of return assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset allocation forecast returns are based on the combination of historical returns current market conditions and a forecast for the capital markets for the next 57 years approximately 75 of the return assumption is based on the historical information and 25 is based on current or forwardlooking information all asset class assumptions are within certain bands around the longterm historical averages correlations are based primarily on historical return patterns

expected benefit payments under the defined benefit pension plans and expected gross benefit payments and subsidy receipts under the postretirement benefit for the next five years subsequent to 2007 and in the aggregate for the following five years are as follows 

 

 

 

assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the postretirement plans for the year to date period are as follows 

 

 

 

if the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage point in each year the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 30 2007 and the aggregate of the benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would have each increased by approximately 5 

 

international plans 

 

pension coverage for employees of hasbro’s international subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans at december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 the defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of 72359 and 73333 respectively and fair values of plan assets of 55881 and 55429 respectively substantially all of the plan assets are invested in equity and fixed income securities the pension expense related to these plans was 3937 3702 and 3073 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

in fiscal 2008 the company expects amortization of 120 of prior service costs 25 of unrecognized net losses and 52 of unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost 

 

expected benefit payments under the international defined benefit pension plans for the five years subsequent to 2007 and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows 2008 1115 2009 1244 2010 1482 2011 1635 2012 2398 and 2013 through 2017 16091 

 

postemployment benefits

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion hasbro inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by coso 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of hasbro inc and subsidiaries as of december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 30 2007 and our report dated february 26 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

in addition the hasbro products group outlicenses our intellectual property to third parties on a worldwide basis and the global operations segment is responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the north american and international segments 

 

north america 

 

the north american segment’s strategy in 2006 continued to be based on growing core brands through innovation and reinvention introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and licenses in recent years a major source of innovation has been the incorporation of greater technology into our products the use of technology has increased our ability to develop products that appeal to older children who have been shifting from traditional toys and games to consumer electronic products such as mp3 players cell phones and other entertainment and lifestyle products in addition we seek to grow our business and maintain our brands by refreshing and reintroducing products from our vast portfolio which have been out of the market for extended periods of time recent successful reintroductions of products include baby alive in 2006 littlest pet shop in 2005 and my little pony in 2003 major 2006 brands and products included star wars playskool littlest pet shop nerf magic the gathering playdoh transformers and monopoly in the north american segment our products are organized into the following categories i games and puzzles ii boys’ toys iii girls’ toys iv preschool toys v tween toys and vi other

our boys’ toys include a wide range of core properties such as gi joe and transformers action figures as well as entertainmentbased licensed products based on popular movie and television characters such as star wars and marvel toys and accessories the boys’ toys category is increasingly competing with video games as boys become more sophisticated in their evaluation of entertainment in the action figure area a key part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing the storyline associated with these products through the use of mediabased entertainment in 2007 the company expects to have significant sales of marvel and transformers products due to the anticipated major motion picture releases of spiderman 3 in may of 2007 and transformers in july of 2007 there are two other marvel motion picture releases scheduled in 2007 ghost rider and fantastic four the rise of the silver surfer for which the company will be offering products in 2007 in addition to marketing and developing action figures for traditional play the company also develops and markets products designed for collectors which was a key component of the success of the star wars brand in 2006 in 2007 in addition to toys designed around the marvel and transformers motion picture releases the company will offer products such as the marvel origins product line designed for the collector market 

 

in our girls’ toys category we seek to provide a traditional and wholesome play experience girls’ toys include the my little pony littlest pet shop fur real friends and baby alive brands as well as the easy bake oven in 2007 we will seek to continue the growth of the my little pony and littlest pet shop brands though innovative new lines such as the ponyville line and the teeniest tiniest pet line the fur real friends line combines plush toys with electronic innovation to provide an interactive play experience 

 

our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for preschoolers in the various stages of development from infant to kindergarteners our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands marketed primarily under the playskool trademark the playskool line includes such wellknown products as mr potato head weebles sit ’n spin and gloworm along with a successful line of infant toys including step start walk ’n ride 2in1 tummy time gym and busy ball popper in addition starting in 2007 the playskool line will also include the tonka line of trucks and interactive toys and the playdoh brand through our ages  stages system we seek to provide consumer friendly information that assists parents in understanding the developmental milestones their children will encounter as well as the role each playskool product can play in helping children to achieve these developmental milestones in 2007 the company plans to introduce the made for me toy and gear line that will allow parents to customize activities and features to suit a child’s developmental needs our preschool toys focus on encouraging children to get active through the playskool kid motion line of indoor and outdoor toys as well as seek to promote the use of the child’s imagination through products such as the playdoh line of playsets and products such as dreamtown a system of role play environments and 

accessories in 2007 we plan to continue to increase the visibility of our playskool brand through an agreement with the cvspharmacy retail chain whereby playskool will serve as the private label brand for cvs’ baby care products 

 

our tweens toys category generally markets products under the tiger electronics and nerf brands and seeks to target those children who have outgrown traditional toys the age group targeted by this category is generally 8 to 12 years old in recent years we have used our consumer insights and electronic innovation to develop a strong line of products focusing on this target audience our major tweens toys product lines in 2006 included idog and nerf as demonstrated through our idog product an interactive pet that acts as an accessory to an mp3 player we seek to draw on the popularity of electronic trends in our tween product offerings in 2007 we will seek to leverage the interest of this age group in music and musical instruments through the introduction of the power tour guitar product 

 

international 

 

in addition to our business in the united states mexico and canada in 2006 we operated in more than 20 other countries selling a representative range of the toy and game products marketed in north america together with some items that are sold only internationally the major geographic regions included in the international segment are europe asia pacific south america and latin america excluding mexico in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin and south america key international brands for 2006 included monopoly my little pony playskool star wars and littlest pet shop 

 

other segments 

 

in our global operations segment we manufacture and source production of substantially all of our toy and game products the company operates manufacturing facilities in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland sourcing of our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based subsidiary for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing 

 

through our other segment the hasbro products group we generate revenue through the outlicensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we sell our toy and game products directly to retailers primarily on a direct import basis from the far east these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2006 or 2004 fiscal years during the 2005 fiscal year revenues generated from the sale of star wars products produced under our license with lucas licensing and lucasfilm were approximately 494000 which was 16 of our consolidated net revenues in 2005 no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2005 

 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary shortterm borrowings and proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during the fourth 

quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday shipping season the strategy of retailers has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas we expect this trend will continue our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half and within the second half of the year the fourth quarter is more prominent in 2006 the second half of the year accounted for approximately 68 of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33 and 35 of full year revenues respectively in years where the company has products tied to a major motion picture release such as in 2005 with the midyear release of star wars iii revenge of the sith this concentration is not as pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around the time of the motion picture theatrical release in 2007 the company has products tied to two anticipated major motion picture releases spiderman 3 expected to be released in may of 2007 and transformers which is expected to be released in july of 2007 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices now being used result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment with more orders being placed for immediate delivery unshipped orders at january 28 2007 and january 29 2006 were approximately 192000 and 123000 respectively it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year this method is a general industry practice the programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2007 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2006 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2006 and 2005 we utilized cash from our operations proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program borrowing under our revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

 

royalties research and development 

 

our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing development of new products and the redesign of existing products for continued market acceptance in 2006 2005 and 2004 we spent 171358 150586 and 157162 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including products brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2006 2005 and 2004 we incurred 169731 247283 and 223193 respectively of royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment in 2005 royalty expense increased due to the release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith and the corresponding increase of our sales of star wars licensed products in 2007 the company has licensed products tied to anticipated marvel major motion picture releases including spiderman 3 in may of 2007 as well as fantastic four the rise of the silver surfer and ghostrider we will also incur royalties on products based on the theatrical release of transformers in july of 2007 as such we expect higher royalty expense in 2007 then was incurred in 2006 

 

we have 116792 of prepaid royalties which are a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet included in other assets is 64769 representing the longterm portion of royalty advances already paid as further detailed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on contracts in effect at december 31 2006 the company may be required to pay approximately 164780 of minimum guaranteed royalties at various times from 2007 through 2011 amounts paid and advances to be paid relate to anticipated revenues from licensed properties to be sold in the years 2007 through 2018 

 

marketing and sales 

 

our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence although we had more than 2500 customers in the united states and canada during 2006 including specialty retailers carrying trading card games and toyrelated products there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry which we expect to continue as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2006 sales to our three largest customers walmart stores inc target corporation and toys ‘r us inc represented 24 13 and 11 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated net revenues during 2006 90 of the net revenues from our top 5 customers related to the north american segment 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase many of our new products at international toy fairs held early in the fiscal year in hong kong london nuremberg and new york city 

 

in 2006 we spent 368996 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 366371 in 2005 and 387523 in 2004 

 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2006 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east primarily china as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year for this reason we are generally insulated in the shortterm from increases in the prices of raw materials however severe increases in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly the people’s republic of china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china 

 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2007 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by the people’s republic of china could significantly disrupt our operations and increase the cost of our products imported into the united states or europe 

 

we purchase dies and molds principally from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies in our business we must deal with the phenomena that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 5800 persons worldwide approximately 3200 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easy bake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada australia and europe we maintain laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa international standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

forwardlooking information and risk factors that may affect future results 

 

from time to time including in this annual report on form 10k and in our annual report to shareholders we publish “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these “forwardlooking statements” may relate to such matters as our anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods expected technological developments the 

expected timing of new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers the timing of entertainment releases marketing and promotional efforts research and development activities liquidity and similar matters forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements these statements may be identified by the use of forwardlooking words or phrases such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “expect” “intend” “looking forward” “may” “planned” “potential” “should” “will” and “would” or any variations of words with similar meanings we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forwardlooking statements the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the securities and exchange commission such as on forms 8k 10q and 10k we undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report unless otherwise specifically indicated all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares except for per share amounts 

 

volatility of consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success of existing product lines or consistently introduce successful new products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely and costeffective manner may damage our business 

 

the family entertainment business is a fashion industry our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products principally games and toys our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the current preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and consumers could significantly lower our sales and operating margins which would in turn harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is important to identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot” toys and games on children’s “wish lists” our continued success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys games and children’s electronic products which are sought after by both children and their parents we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the redesign and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate evolving consumer tastes coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance creates an environment in which products can be extremely popular during a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with other properties as a result individual family entertainment products and properties generally and high technology products in particular often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products 

 

the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of 

video game suppliers consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties released theatrically for which we have a license such as marvel or star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

 

there is no guarantee that 

 

  

in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued similarly the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season this seasonality is exacerbated as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality has increased over time as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques these customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales occur in the 

fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

 

the continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 walmart stores inc target corporation and toys ‘r us inc accounted for approximately 24 13 and 11 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart target and toys ‘r us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated net revenues these net revenues were primarily related to the north american segment while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could harm our business financial condition and results of operations increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various entertainment properties and theatrical releases such as those based upon marvel or star wars characters the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations at december 31 2006 we had 181561 of prepaid royalties 116792 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 64769 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 31 2006 we may be required to pay future minimum 

guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 164780 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses additionally as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms our revenues and profits may be harmed 

 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 31 2006 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 40 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east to produce the majority of our products and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

  

our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary however if we were prevented from obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations would be disrupted potentially for a significant period of time while alternative sources of products were secured in particular as the majority of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured in the people’s republic of china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe and the labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our operations revenues and earnings factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in the far east through the ports on the western coast of north america whether due to port congestion labor disputes or other factors also the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status 

with the people’s republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result increasing sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames and consumer electronics at younger and younger ages we have needed to work even harder to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include videonow chatnow zoombox our ibranded products such as idog and icat and our furreal friends line of products including butterscotch these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for designing developing and producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter 

 

market conditions including commodity and fuel prices public health conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact our revenues margins and our other business initiatives 

 

economic and public health conditions including factors that impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand or our ability to manufacture and deliver products can have a significant impact on our business the success of our family entertainment products is dependent on consumer purchasing of those products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline and home heating fuels may reduce household spending on entertainment products we offer in addition rising fuel and raw material prices for components such as resin used in plastics or increased transportation costs may increase our costs for producing and transporting our products which in turn may reduce our margins and harm our business 

 

in addition general economic conditions and employment levels can impact demand for our products economic conditions were significantly harmed by the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our sales and profitability 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or alter our 

actions and reduce actual results for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes a severe public health pandemic or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product resulting in increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our income 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet however as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 532257 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few years acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products we may also target companies in markets where we would like to increase our local presence however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that we will be successful in a particular geographic region in some cases we expect that the integration of the product lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services 

 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business the fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements 

 

we rely on external financing including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility to fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have a fiveyear revolving credit agreement which provides for a 300000 committed revolving credit facility which provides the company the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of 50000 up to a total of 500000 the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants noncompliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 

 

as an additional source of working capital and liquidity we currently have a 250000 accounts receivable securitization program which is increased to 300000 from fiscal october through fiscal january under this program we sell on an ongoing basis substantially all of our us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity under this facility the special purpose entity is able to sell on a revolving basis undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits during the term of the facility we must maintain certain performance ratios if we fail to maintain these ratios we could be prevented from accessing this costeffective source of working capital and shortterm financing 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility are adequate for current and planned needs in 2007 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had 494983 of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all this total indebtedness includes 249996 in aggregate principal amount of 275 senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001 on december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid 

interest in cash we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 

 

we previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an option through january 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us for a price to be paid at our election of either 100000 in cash or 110000 in our common stock such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option should we be required to settle these warrants under this option we believe that we will have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary however we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations violation of which could subject us to sanctions in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall while costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business the costs associated with future product recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant in addition any product recall regardless of direct costs of the recall may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations 

 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe sufficient for our business risks we may not be able to maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims moreover even if we maintain sufficient insurance coverage any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net income 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire current accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit at december 31 2006 approximately 469938 or 152 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net income caused by the writedown of goodwill could harm our results of operations

executive summary 

 

the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products the company sells these products both within the united states and in a number of international markets the company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year and within that half the fourth quarter in 2006 68 of the company’s net revenues were generated in the second half of the year with 35 of annual net revenues generated in the fourth quarter in both 2005 and 2004 percentages were comparable at 67 and 35 for the second half and fourth quarter while many of the company’s products are based on brands the company owns or controls the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors in addition the company licenses rights to produce products based on movie television music and other entertainment properties such as marvel and star wars properties 

 

in january 2006 the company simplified its operating segment structure in order to better focus on consumer demands better anticipate the needs of its retail customers provide a more integrated toy and game marketing plan place a greater companywide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its overall business the company’s north american toy and games business is managed under common leadership providing a combined focus on developing marketing and selling products in the us canada and mexico the international segment consists of the company’s european asia pacific and latin american marketing operations excluding mexico the company’s worldwide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its global operations segment the hasbro products group continues to be responsible for the worldwide outlicensing of the company’s intellectual properties and works closely with the north american and international segments on the coordinated outlicensing activities of the company’s brands 

 

the company’s focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet while the company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths given the strength of its core brands the company may also seek to drive productrelated revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainmentbased theatrical venues as an example of this in july of 2007 the transformers motion picture is expected to be released and the company has developed products based on the motion picture that will be marketed in 2007 

 

the company’s core brands represent companyowned or companycontrolled brands such as gi joe transformers my little pony monopoly magic the gathering playskool and tonka which have been successful over the long term the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand by focusing on core brands the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth in 2006 the company had strong sales of core brand products namely playskool littlest pet shop monopoly nerf and playdoh 

 

in addition to its focus on core brands the company’s strategy also involves trying to meet everchanging consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 

 

with the theatrical release of lucasfilm’s star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in may 2005 and the subsequent holiday season dvd release sales of product related to the company’s strategic star wars license were a significant contributor to 2005 revenues and have continued to be strong in 2006 pairing this key licensed property with the company’s ability to design and produce action figures role playing toys and games as well as its ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product globally was the key to this line’s success while sales of product related to this license performed well in 2006 they were lower than 2005 

 

while the company’s strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative new products it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the company believes it is economically attractive in 2006 the company entered into a license with marvel entertainment inc and marvel characters inc collectively “marvel” to produce toys and games based on marvel’s portfolio of characters the company will also incur royalties on products based on the theatrical release of transformers in july 2007 while gross profits of theatrical entertainmentbased products are generally higher than many of the company’s other products sales from these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins in certain instances such as with lucasfilm’s star wars the company may also incur amortization expense on property rightbased assets acquired from the licensor of such properties further impacting profit made on these products 

 

the company remains committed to reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins over the last 5 years the company has improved its operating margin from 78 in 2002 to 119 in 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2006 as part of its ongoing cost reduction efforts the company determined that it will reduce its manufacturing activity in ireland and transition the manufacture of certain products to the company’s suppliers in china the company is also investing to grow its business in emerging international markets with a strong balance sheet and having achieved a debt to capitalization ratio of between 2530 the company will also continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business the company expects to leverage revenue to offset the impact of these investments and maintain 2007 operating margin levels near 2006 

 

in recent years the company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchase and dividends as part of this initiative in july 2006 the company’s board of directors the “board’’ authorized the repurchase of an additional 350000 in common stock after a previous authorization of 350000 was exhausted in july 2006 for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 the company has invested 456744 in the repurchase of 22767 shares of common stock in the open market the company intends to opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions in addition in february 2007 the company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to 16 per share this is the fourth consecutive year that the board of directors has increased the dividend rate

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances inventory valuation recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and stockbased compensation 

 

sales allowances 

 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically 

against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2006 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon a consideration of quantities on hand actual and projected sales volume anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued slowmoving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded as an increase to cost of sales when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard during 2006 there have been no material adjustments to the company’s estimates 

 

recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and no impairment was indicated the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 31 2006 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 545676 recorded on the balance sheet 

 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 456519 at december 31 2006 during 2006 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

 

recoverability of royalty advances and commitments 

 

the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and 

related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the remaining minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 31 2006 the company had 181561 of prepaid royalties 116792 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 64769 which are included in other assets 

 

pension costs and obligations 

 

the company except for certain international subsidiaries has pension plans covering substantially all of its fulltime employees pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets expected compensation increases and applicable discount rates 

 

the estimates for the company’s domestic plans are established at the company’s measurement date of september 30 to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans as of that date and to establish the expense for the upcoming year as a result of the company’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas no 158” in december 2006 the company will be required to change the measurement date for its pension plans to match its yearend date by 2008 

 

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was 875 in 2006 2005 and 2004 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 25 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2006 pension expense for us plans by approximately 550 

 

expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical and expected compensation increases based on this analysis the company’s estimate of expected longterm compensation increases for its us plans was 40 in 2006 2005 and 2004 increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 

 

discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits based on this longterm corporate bond yield at september 30 2006 the company’s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities the company’s discount rate for its domestic plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense was 575 compared to a rate of 550 used in the calculation of 2006 pension expense and 575 used in the calculation of 2005 pension expense a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 25 in the company’s discount rate would have increased 2006 pension expense and the 2006 projected benefit obligation by approximately 756 and 9395 respectively 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods in december 2006 the company adopted sfas no 158 which required that the funded status of the plans be recognized on the company’s balance sheet and any unrecognized gains or losses be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2006 the company has unrecognized actuarial losses of 48879 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

the company has a stockbased compensation plan for employees and nonemployee members of the company’s board of directors under this plan the company grants stock options at or above the fair market value of the company’s stock on december 26 2005 the first day of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r which requires the company to measure all stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to value the stock options that are granted under these plans the blackscholes method includes four significant assumptions 1 expected term of the options 2 riskfree interest rate 3 expected dividend yield and 4 expected stock price volatility for the company’s 2006 stock option grant the weighted average expected term was approximately 5 years this amount is based on a review of employees’ exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option the weighted average riskfree interest rate used for 2006 stock option grants was 498 this estimate was based on the interest rate available on us treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option for 2006 stock option grants the weighted average expected dividend yield used was 255 which is based on the company’s current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant the weighted average expected stock price volatility used for 2006 stock option grants was 24 this amount was derived using a combination of historical price volatility over the most recent period approximating the expected term of the option and implied price volatility implied price volatility represents the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the company’s stock which the company believes represents the expected future volatility of the company’s stock price the company believes that since this is a marketbased estimate it can provide a better estimate of expected future volatility 

 

in july 2006 as part of its employee stockbased compensation plan the company issued contingent stock performance awards which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the company’s common stock based on the company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over a ten quarter period beginning july 3 2006 and ending december 28 2008 each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets the measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the company’s current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards

in addition to the above the company has certain warrants outstanding at december 31 2006 that contain a put option that would require the company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid at the company’s election of either 100000 in cash or 110000 in shares of the company’s common stock such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option the company’s current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised in accordance with sfas 150 these warrants are recorded as a current liability in the amount of 155630 which represented the fair value of these warrants at december 31 2006 

 

in addition the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately 7100 to its pension plans in 2007 the company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately 71000 at december 31 2006 

 

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate 22000 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts other than as set forth above the company does not hedge foreign currency exposures the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 31 2006 these contracts had unrealized losses of 2574 which are recorded in accrued liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2006 are deferred losses of 2116 net of tax 

 

at december 31 2006 the company had fixed rate longterm debt excluding fair value adjustments of 494983 at december 31 2006 the company had fixedforfloating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 75000 the interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related longterm debt at 

december 31 2006 the fair value of these contracts were a liability of 66 which is included in longterm liabilities with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease longterm debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 15600 or 12800 respectively a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2007 pretax earnings and cash flows by 731 and 377 respectively 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top 5 customers all retailers accounted for approximately 53 53 and 50 of its consolidated net revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2006 approximately 68 of the company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year although the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year in 2007 the company will have products related to two major motion picture releases spiderman 3 in may of 2007 and transformers in july of 2007 the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the company’s revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2006 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

in managing our business in 2005 we focused on two major areas toys and games organizationally our principal segments were us toys games and international in 2005 our us toys segment engaged in the development marketing and selling of toy and children’s consumer electronic products in the united states our games segment included the development manufacturing marketing and selling of games as well as electronic learning aids and puzzles in the united states within the international segment we developed manufactured marketed and sold both toy and game products in nonus markets financial information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 15 to our financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k

the remainder of this business discussion is formatted consistently with our 2005 segment structure 

 

us toys 

 

the us toys segment’s strategy in 2005 was based on growing core brands through innovation and reinvention introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses in order to meet shifting consumer dynamics the execution of this strategy centered on consumer insights which are used to inform and motivate our product development we use consumer insights to drive innovation across our business in recent years a major source of innovation 

has been technology which the us toys segment has used to address the issue of “children getting older younger” this represents the trend whereby children at younger ages are shifting from traditional toys to electronic devices such as mp3 players cell phones and other entertainment and lifestyle products major 2005 brands and products included star wars videonow idog playskool my little pony nerf transformers and littlest pet shop in the us toys segment our products are organized into one of four categories boys’ toys girls’ toys preschool and tween products 

 

our boys’ toys include a wide range of core properties such as gi joe and transformers action figures and the tonka line of trucks and interactive toys other products include entertainmentbased licensed products based on popular movie and television characters such as star wars toys and accessories in 2005 our star wars based line of toys and accessories was extremely successful bolstered by the theater and dvd release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith as boys become more sophisticated in their evaluation of entertainment our boys’ toys are increasingly competing with video games for boys’ attention roleplaying is a vital part of our boys’ toys business as demonstrated in 2005 through the introduction of star wars light sabers and the darth vader voicechanger we seek to develop products that will allow boys to look and act like their favorite characters in the action figure area a key part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing the storyline associated with these products through the use of mediabased entertainment primarily television in 2006 both gi joe and transformers will continue to have television programming to assist in providing exposure to the characters and story lines associated with these products in addition a key factor in the success of 2005 was the performance of our sports action brands such as nerf products we expect the momentum in this line to continue in 2006 as we introduce innovative new products such as nerf showtime hoops in january 2006 we completed a licensing agreement with marvel entertainment inc and its subsidiary marvel characters inc to produce action figures and other toys and games based on their library of intellectual property including spiderman and the fantastic 4 we expect certain products related to this license to begin shipping late in 2006 with the full extent of the licensed products being recognized in 2007 and thereafter 

 

in our girls’ toy category we seek to provide a traditional and wholesome play experience girls’ toys include the my little pony and littlest pet shop lines as well as the easy bake oven in 2005 the my little pony brand was supported by the dvd release of my little pony a very minty christmas in 2006 we plan to support this brand with two new dvd releases the littlest pet shop will build on its strong reintroduction in 2005 with new electronic play patterns in 2006 we also plan to enter a new category in 2006 large dolls with the reintroduction of baby alive a doll incorporating animatronic technology 

 

our preschool toy category encompasses a range of products for preschoolers in the various stages of development from infant to kindergarteners our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands marketed primarily under the playskool trademark the playskool line includes such wellknown products as mr potato head weebles sit ‘n spin and gloworm along with a successful line of infant toys including step start walk n‘ ride 2in1 tummy time gym and busy ball popper through our ages  stages system we seek to provide consumer friendly information that assists parents in understanding the developmental milestones their children will encounter as well as the role each playskool product can play in helping children to achieve these developmental milestones in 2006 a major focus of our preschool line will be on one of the fastest growing segments of the preschool toy market electronic learning aids with the planned introduction of two new product lines ion an interactive educational gaming system and tj bearytales an electronic story telling bear in addition in 2006 the playdoh brand will be celebrating its 50 th anniversary and will be supported by a variety of promotional programs 

 

our tweens toy category generally markets products under the tiger electronics brand and seeks to target those children who have outgrown traditional toys the age group targeted by this category is generally 8 to 12 years old in recent years we have used our consumer insights and electronic innovation to develop a strong line of products focusing on this target audience our major tweens toys product lines in 2005 included videonow idog and chatnow as demonstrated through our 2005 launch of idog 

an interactive pet that acts as an accessory to an mp3 player we seek to draw on the popularity of electronic trends in our tween product offerings in 2006 we plan to continue offering innovative new products in this category including zoombox 

 

games 

 

our games segment strategy focused on providing product innovation based on consumer insights including an understanding of consumer attitudes and behaviors we market our games and puzzles under several well known core brands including milton bradley parker brothers tiger games avalon hill and wizards of the coast major 2005 products included trivial pursuit candy land monopoly and magic the gathering 

 

the milton bradley parker brothers tiger games and avalon hill brand portfolios consist of a broad assortment of games for children tweens families and adults core game items include monopoly battleship game of life scrabble chutes and ladders candy land trouble mousetrap operation hungry hungry hippos connect four twister yahtzee jenga simon clue sorry risk boggle and trivial pursuit as well as a line of jigsaw puzzles for children and adults including big ben and croxley in 2005 we added to our puzzle portfolio through the acquisition of the assets and product lines of wrebbit inc a creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles including three dimensional puzzles marketed under the puzz3d brand we seek to keep our core brands relevant through sustained marketing programs as well as by offering consumers new ways to experience them in 2006 we plan to continue this strategy through the introduction of core brand extensions such as big trouble yahtzee turbo and trivial pursuit 80’s edition another way we seek to keep our core brands fresh is through cobranding of some of our most popular lines by developing and introducing products such as candy land dora edition and monopoly star wars edition we are able to extend our brand franchises by appealing to a broader consumer base in 2006 we plan to continue to capitalize on popular licensed franchises including disney the simpsons star wars and nickleodeon 

 

in addition to our core brands strategy the games segment seeks to extend beyond traditional board games by developing technologybased platforms that reflect evolving consumer lifestyles in 2005 we continued to offer many dvd extensions of our traditional games such as our candy land dvd game in 2006 we plan to continue this focus on innovative new games through the introduction of twister dance a dvdbased game giga pets combo a combination of a handheld and plug n’ play game as well a variety of other new technologyenabled games we have a series of marketing initiatives designed to encourage game play among a wide variety of audiences including promotional programs designed to support the family games and adult games lines respectively in 2005 we introduced our games make great gifts marketing campaign which we plan to continue in 2006 

 

wizards of the coast offers a variety of successful trading card and roleplaying games including magic the gathering and dungeons  dragons in addition to maintaining our focus on the success of magic the gathering in both trading cards and online formats our 2006 strategy will also focus on expanding our successful miniatures lines and our publishing business the miniatures lines of prepainted plastic characters are designed to enhance the roleplaying experience we will also seek to continue the success of wizards of the coast’s publishing endeavors that have produced several books that were included on the new york times bestseller list in recent years in 2006 we will seek to expand our marketing to younger readers by encouraging them to read through the placement of books in schools and libraries throughout the us 

 

international 

 

in addition to our business in the united states in 2005 we operated in more than 25 countries selling a representative range of the toy and game products marketed in the united states together with some items that are sold only internationally in 2005 all of our international operations were managed under our international segment in addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses 

we seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand into eastern europe and emerging markets in asia and latin america key international brands for 2005 included milton bradley and parker brothers games star wars action man furby furreal friends beyblade playdoh playskool monopoly and magic the gathering in 2006 our canadian and mexican operations are being moved into our new north american segment along with the us toys and games segments our other international operations primarily in europe the asia pacific region and latin america will be managed as separate geographic units under common leadership within our international segment 

 

other segments 

 

in our operations segment we source production of substantially all of our toy products and certain of our game products through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based subsidiary for quality control and order coordination purposes see “manufacturing and importing” below for more details concerning overseas manufacturing in 2006 our global operations segment will continue to source product for our marketing and sales subsidiaries and is expected to also manage our manufacturing operations in north america and europe 

 

our other segment the hasbro properties group generates revenue through the outlicensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own product offerings 

 

other information 

 

to further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business we have hong kong operations that sell our toy and game products directly to retailers primarily on a direct import basis these sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer resides 

 

certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence 

 

during the 2005 fiscal year revenues generated from the sale of star wars products produced under our license with lucas licensing and lucasfilm were approximately 494000 which was 16 of our consolidated net revenues in 2005 no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2005 no individual line of products accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2004 fiscal year during the 2003 fiscal year revenues from our beyblade line of products were 11 of our consolidated net revenues no other line of products constituted 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2003 

 

working capital requirements 

 

our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash generated from operations and when necessary shortterm borrowings and proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during the fourth quarter of each year this corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the production and shipment of product in preparation for the holiday shipping season our historical revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is more significant to our overall business than the first half and within the second half of the year the fourth quarter is the more prominent the strategy of retailers has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas this trend has become more pronounced over the past few years and we expect that it will continue 

 

the toy and game business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we have product licenses and changes in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not 

necessarily indicative of our sales for that year moreover quick response inventory management practices now being used result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment with more orders being placed for immediate delivery unshipped orders at january 29 2006 and january 23 2005 were approximately 123000 and 131000 respectively it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year this method is a general industry practice the programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2006 are substantially the same as those we employed in 2005 these are primarily fixed programs for which a customer may qualify based on purchases of company products throughout the year 

 

historically we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season our accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year the timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2005 and 2004 we utilized cash from our operations proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization program borrowing under our secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements 

 

royalties research and development 

 

our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing development of new products and the redesign of existing items for continued market acceptance in 2005 2004 and 2003 we spent 150586 157162 and 143183 respectively on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including items brought to us by independent designers and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

 

in addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff we deal with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by us are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

 

we also produce a number of toys under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements in 2005 2004 and 2003 we incurred 247283 223193 and 248423 respectively of total royalty expense a portion of this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty advances our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment in 2005 royalty expense increased due to the release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith and the corresponding increase of our sales of star wars licensed products we have 37107 of prepaid royalties which are a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet included in other assets is 89408 representing the longterm portion of royalty advances already paid as further detailed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on contracts in effect at december 25 2005 the company may be required to pay approximately 66770 of minimum guaranteed royalties at various times from 2006 through 2010 amounts paid and advances to be paid relate to anticipated revenues from licensed properties to be sold in the years 2006 through 2018 in addition in january 2006 we entered into a fiveyear arrangement with marvel entertainment inc and its subsidiary marvel characters inc “marvel” to develop products based on 

certain marvel properties including spiderman for retail sale beginning on january 1 2007 the agreement requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of 205000 of this 205000 in guaranteed payment 100000 was paid in february 2006 70000 is expected to be paid in 2007 upon the release of spiderman 3 and the remainder is to be paid upon the release of spiderman 4 whose release date is yet to be determined 

 

marketing and sales 

 

our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased “etailers” our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products for the most part in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence we maintain showrooms in new york and selected other major cities worldwide as well as at many of our subsidiary locations although we had more than 2500 customers in the united states and canada during 2005 including specialty retailers carrying trading card games and toyrelated products there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry which we expect to continue as a result the majority of our sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us in addition customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market during 2005 sales to our three largest customers walmart stores inc toys ‘r us inc and target corporation represented 24 12 and 12 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated net revenues 

 

we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item but also other items we offer in those product groups as well we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale in addition we showcase many of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february 

 

in 2005 we spent 366371 on advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 387523 in 2004 and 363876 in 2003 

 

manufacturing and importing 

 

during 2005 substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts and waterford ireland 

 

most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year for this reason we are generally insulated in the shortterm from increases in the prices of raw materials however severe increases in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games as well as some finished items from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries however the countries of the far east and particularly the people’s republic of china constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers together with our own facilities as well as the supply of components accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2006 for our products our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for our products should such changes be necessary or desirable however if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations and our ability to obtain products would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by the people’s republic of china could significantly disrupt our operations and increase the cost of our products imported into the united states or europe 

 

we purchase dies and molds principally from independent united states and international sources 

 

competition 

 

we are a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys but our business is highly competitive we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers manufacturers and marketers competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products to a lesser extent competition is also based on product pricing 

 

in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies in our business we must deal with the phenomena that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age we refer to this as “children getting older younger” as a result our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers but we must compete particularly in meeting the demands of older children with the entertainment offerings of many other companies such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 

 

the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new opportunities for existing competitors and startups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 

 

employees 

 

at december 25 2005 we employed approximately 5900 persons worldwide approximately 3300 of whom were located in the united states 

 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

 

we seek to protect our products for the most part and in as many countries as practical through registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 

 

government regulation 

 

our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act the “cpsa” the federal hazardous substances act the “fhsa” the flammable fabrics act the “ffa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder in addition certain of our products such as the mixes for our easy bake ovens are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 

 

the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the “cpsc” to take action against hazards presented by consumer products including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn 

an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall replacement repair or refund for the product the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 

 

consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada australia and europe we maintain laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa the fhsa the ffa international standards and our own standards notwithstanding the foregoing there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free any material product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition depending on the product and scope of the recall and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well 

 

the children’s television act of 1990 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission as well as the laws of certain foreign countries place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming 

 

we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal state local and international requirements relating to the environment plant safety and other matters

volatility of consumer preferences combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the longterm success of existing product lines or consistently introduce successful new products in addition an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely manner may damage our business 

 

the family entertainment business is a fashion industry our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products principally games and toys our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to children’s interests and the preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our profitability 

 

a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance could significantly lower our sales and operating margins which would harm our profitability business and financial condition in our industry it is important to identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot” toys and games on children’s wish lists our continued success will depend on our ability to develop market and sell popular toys games and children’s electronic products which are sought after by both children and their parents we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the redesign and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways that capture consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant in today’s world and by developing introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate individual family entertainment products and properties generally and high technology products in particular often have short consumer life cycles 

 

not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring consumer tastes seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing in addition to existing competitors the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low new participants with a popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products 

 

the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children “getting older younger” by this we mean that children are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and as a result at younger and younger ages our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 

 

in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us the success of entertainment properties released theatrically for which we have a license such as star wars related products can significantly affect our revenues if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering in addition competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products based on these properties the loss of ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 

 

there is no guarantee that 

 

1 any of our current products or product lines will continue to be popular 

 

2 any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity 

 

3 any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance 

4 any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover development manufacturing marketing royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of producing and selling the product or 

 

5 we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands a risk that is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business 

 

in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued similarly the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media efforts television programming movie and dvd releases comic book releases and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products not only our efforts but the efforts of third parties heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases those statements are based on our current plans and expectations unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation any delay or cancellation of planned product development work introductions or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season further this seasonality is increasing as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 

 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season including christmas this seasonality is increasing as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques these customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers such as us closer to the time of purchase by consumers for toys games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales occur in the fourth quarter close to the holiday season as a consequence the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december as our customers do not want to maintain large onhand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 

 

the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand resulting in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season or by events such 

as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods particularly from the far east during the months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 

 

the continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 25 2005 walmart stores inc toys ‘r us inc and target corporation accounted for approximately 24 12 and 12 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart toys ‘r us and target in the aggregate accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated net revenues while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could harm our business financial condition and results of operations increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 

 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

 

an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various theatrical releases such as star wars movies the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of such amounts that would harm our results of operations at december 25 2005 we had 126515 of prepaid royalties 37107 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 89408 of which are included in other assets under the terms of existing contracts as of december 25 2005 we are required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately 66770 acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses as a licensee we have no guaranty that a particular brand will translate into successful toy or game products 

 

in addition to contracts existing as of the end of our 2005 fiscal year in january 2006 we entered into a license arrangement with marvel entertainment inc and its subsidiary marvel characters inc this license arrangement which grants us the right to produce certain products based on marvel’s characters for five years for retail sales beginning in 2007 requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of up to 205000 there is no guarantee that we will sell enough licensed merchandise under the agreement to earnout the 205000 in guaranteed payments and make a profit 

 

we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses our revenues and profits may be harmed 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 

 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 25 2005 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 40 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations including 

 

1 currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations 

 

2 limitations including taxes on the repatriation of earnings 

 

3 political instability civil unrest and economic instability 

 

4 greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

 

5 complications in complying with laws in varying jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies 

 

6 natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in recovering therefrom 

 

7 transportation delays and interruptions and 

 

8 the imposition of tariffs 

 

our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary however if we were prevented from obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations would be disrupted while alternative sources of products were secured in particular as the majority of our toy products in addition to certain other products are manufactured in the people’s republic of china health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets including north america and europe could have a significant negative impact on our operations factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential revaluation of the chinese yuan which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china or increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in the far east through the ports on the western coast of north america also the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with the people’s republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 

 

part of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic products the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games as a result increasing sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 

 

as children have grown “older younger” and have become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products such as videogames and consumer electronics at younger and younger ages we have needed to work even harder to keep our products relevant for these consumers one initiative we have been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games examples of such products in the last few years include videonow chatnow mission paintball and idog these products if successful can be an effective way for us to connect with tween consumers and increase 

sales however children’s electronics in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products also face certain additional risks 

 

our costs for producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products such as board games and action figures the ability to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics as a consequence our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products in addition the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter 

 

market conditions including commodity and fuel prices public health conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact our margins and our other business initiatives 

 

economic and public health conditions including factors that impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand or our ability to manufacture and deliver products can have a significant impact on our business the success of our family entertainment products is dependant on consumer purchasing of those products consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumer’s budgets generally and which are not due to our product offerings significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers such as gasoline and home heating fuels may reduce household spending on entertainment products we offer in addition rising fuel and raw material prices for components such as resin or increased transportation costs may increase our costs for producing and transporting our products which in turn may reduce our margins and harm our business 

 

in addition general economic conditions and employment levels can impact demand for our products economic conditions were significantly harmed by the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and other conflicts increases in critical commodity prices or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could harm our sales and profitability 

 

other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or alter our actions and reduce actual results for example work stoppages slowdowns or strikes or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product resulting in increased costs andor lost sales for our products 

 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully in addition we have a material amount of acquired product rights which if impaired would result in a reduction of our income 

 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet as of december 25 2005 we had approximately 609678 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and 

could result in an impairment charge reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 

 

although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few years acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings in making acquisitions we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products however we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in some cases we expect that the integration of the product lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to operate them autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services 

 

from time to time we are involved in litigation arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business 

 

we rely on external financing including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility to fund our operations if we were unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be harmed 

 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those in the third and fourth quarters we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital we currently have an amended and restated revolving credit agreement which provides for a 350000 revolving credit facility the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements and a number of other limitations including restrictions on capital expenditures investments acquisitions share repurchases incurrence of indebtedness and dividend payments these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants if we were unable to meet our financial covenants or if we failed to comply with other covenants in our credit facility we could face significant negative consequences including loss of the ability to raise capital under these facilities to fund our operations 

 

as an additional source of working capital and liquidity we currently have a 250000 accounts receivable securitization program under this program we sell on an ongoing basis substantially all of our us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity under this facility the special purpose entity is able to sell on a revolving basis undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits during the term of the facility we must maintain certain performance ratios if we fail to maintain these ratios we could be prevented from accessing this costeffective source of working capital and shortterm financing 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility are adequate for current and planned needs 

in 2006 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

 

as of december 25 2005 we had approximately 5277 million of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all this total indebtedness includes 249996 in aggregate principal amount of 275 senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001 on december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 

 

we previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an option through january 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us for a price to be paid at our election of either 100000 in cash or 110000 in our common stock such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option should we be required to settle these warrants under this option we believe that we will have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary however we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation we are subject to various government regulations violation of which could subject us to sanctions in addition we could be the subject of future product liability suits which could harm our business 

 

as a manufacturer of consumer products we are subject to significant government regulations under the consumer products safety act the federal hazardous substances act and the flammable fabrics act in addition certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration while we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition to government regulation products that have been or may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe sufficient for our business risks we may not be able to maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims moreover even if we maintain sufficient insurance coverage any successful claim could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a large multinational corporation we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world including antitrust customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations and the foreign corrupt 

practices act our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition 

 

we have a material amount of goodwill which if it becomes impaired would result in a reduction in our net income 

 

goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire current accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit at december 25 2005 approximately 467061 or 141 of our total assets represented goodwill declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a further writedown of our goodwill reductions in our net income caused by the writedown of goodwill could harm our results of operations

executive summary 

 

the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products the company sells these products both within the united states and in a number of international markets while many of the company’s products are based on brands the company owns or controls the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors the company also licenses rights to produce products based on movie television music and other family entertainment properties such as star wars 

 

for the past several years the company has focused on growing core owned and controlled brands developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet while the company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties the company continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and leverage its key strengths 

 

the company’s core brands represent companyowned or companycontrolled brands such as gi joe transformers my little pony monopoly magic the gathering playskool and tonka which the company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a corebrand by focusing on core brands the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth however the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it challenging to maintain the longterm success of existing product lines and to consistently introduce successful new products 

 

in addition to its focus on core brands the company’s strategy also involves trying to meet everchanging consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights in 2005 the company’s position as a leader in developing innovative electronic products for children was reinforced with the introduction of products such as idog videonow xp zoombox and the reintroduction of an enhanced interactive furby the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 

 

with the theatrical release of lucasfilm’s star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in may 2005 and the subsequent holiday season dvd release sales of product related to the company’s strategic star wars license rose substantially in 2005 aggregate net revenues from products associated with this license were approximately 494000 in 2005 and accounted for 16 of consolidated net revenues pairing this key licensed property with the company’s ability to design and produce action figures role playing toys and games as well as the ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product globally was the key to this line’s success while the company’s strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative new products the company will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the company believes it is economically attractive in early 2006 the company announced it entered into a license with marvel entertainment inc and marvel characters inc to produce toys and games based on marvel’s portfolio of characters while gross profits of theatrical entertainmentbased products are generally higher than many of the company’s other products sales from 

these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins in certain instances such as with lucasfilm’s star wars the company may also incur amortization expense on property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties further impacting profit made on these items 

 

the company’s strategy in the last several years has also involved reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins the company ended 2005 with a strong balance sheet the company has achieved its targeted debt to capitalization ratio and will continue making scheduled debt repayments 

 

in 2005 utilizing cash from operations the company reacquired the digital gaming rights on several of its core brands which had previously been licensed to a third party and purchased the assets of wrebbit inc a maker of innovative puzzles which complement the company’s current product portfolio the company will continue to evaluate acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business 

 

as part of its continuous effort to focus on consumer demands better anticipate the needs of its retail customers provide a more integrated toy and game marketing plan place a greater companywide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its overall business in january 2006 the company announced that it has simplified and integrated its operating segment structure the company’s north american toy and games business will be managed under common leadership beginning in 2006 providing a combined focus on developing marketing and selling products in the us canada and mexico the international segment will consist of the company’s european asia pacific and latin american marketing operations the company’s worldwide manufacturing and product sourcing operations will be managed through its global operations segment the hasbro properties group will continue to be responsible for the worldwide outlicensing of the company’s intellectual properties and will work closely with the north american and international segments on the development and licensing of the company’s brands the remainder of this discussion and analysis is presented according to the 2005 segment structure under which the company operated 

 

summary 

 

the relationship between various components of the results of operations stated as a percent of net revenues is illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended december 25 2005 

 

 

results of operations 

 

net earnings for the fiscal year ended december 25 2005 were 212075 or 109 per diluted share this compares to net earnings for fiscal 2004 and 2003 of 195977 and 157664 or 96 and 85 per diluted share respectively 

 

net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 include income tax expense of approximately 25800 related to the company’s repatriation of approximately 547000 of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 pursuant to the special incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2003 include a cumulative effect of accounting change net of tax of 17351 or 09 per diluted share relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity” “sfas 150” 

 

consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 25 2005 were 3087627 compared to 2997510 in 2004 and 3138657 in 2003 most of the company’s revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments us toys games and international which are discussed in detail below 

 

the following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the company’s three principal segments for each of the three fiscal years ended december 25 2005 

 

 

 

us toys 

 

us toys segment net revenues for the year ended december 25 2005 increased 13 to 1074540 from 952923 in 2004 this increase is predominantly due to increased revenues from star wars related products as the result of the theatrical and dvd releases of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in 2005 in addition to the increase in star wars related revenues 2005 us toys revenues were also positively impacted by the successful reintroduction of littlest pet shop and furby products as well as increased sales of nerf products these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of videonow and furreal friends products as well as the continued decline in beyblade products in addition other boys’ toys products such as gi joe and transformers were negatively impacted by the success of star wars products 

 

us toys operating profit increased to 79991 in 2005 from 7185 in 2004 the increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue us toys gross profit was also positively impacted by the change in product mix with increased sales of high margin lines such as star wars and littlest pet shop products and decreased sales of videonow products which carry a lower gross margin the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased royalty and amortization expense resulting from increased sales of star wars products us toys product development costs decreased as the result of efficiencies gained from its realignment in 2004 this realignment streamlined the us toys workforce and moved certain product development outside of the us advertising expense also decreased for us toys in 2005 primarily 

due to the high percentage of sales from star wars products which do not require as much advertising and promotion to raise awareness as an internallydeveloped product would 

 

us toys segment net revenues for the year ended december 26 2004 decreased 10 to 952923 from 2003 the results reflect an overall softness in the boys’ toy business as demonstrated primarily by decreased sales of beyblade and to a lesser extent lower sales of transformers and gi joe products decreased sales of playskool and zoids products also contributed to the overall decrease in revenues these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of videonow products increased shipments of my little pony products which were reintroduced in the third quarter of 2003 and revenues from the new product launch of lazer tag net revenues in 2004 were also positively impacted by increased shipments of star wars products over 2003 

 

the decrease in us toys’ operating profit to 7185 in 2004 from 2003 primarily relates to decreased gross profit as a result of the lower net revenues as well as a change in product mix including the decline in sales of beyblade products which carry a higher gross margin and increased sales of videonow hardware which carry a lower gross margin competitive price pressures and customer sales allowances related to videonow also contributed to lower gross margin increased advertising expense related to core brands and new product introductions also contributed to the decline in operating profit us toys’ 2004 operating profit was also impacted by charges of 6900 associated with organizational and staffing changes made in december 2004 the decrease in operating profit was partially offset by decreased royalties driven by lower sales of beyblade products as well as lower selling distribution and administration expenses as a result of a combination of lower sales activity and the company’s cost reduction initiatives

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company’s reported financial results include sales allowances inventory valuation recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 

 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon a consideration of quantities on hand actual and projected sales volume anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued slowmoving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded as an increase to cost of sales when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 

 

the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach the company’s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and no impairment was indicated the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge at december 25 2005 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 542799 recorded on the balance sheet 

 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying value 

to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 533940 at december 25 2005 during 2005 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 

 

the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the remaining minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 25 2005 the company had 126515 of prepaid royalties 37107 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 89408 which are included in other assets 

 

the company except for certain international subsidiaries has pension plans covering substantially all of its fulltime employees pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets expected compensation increases and applicable discount rates the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the company’s estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was 875 in 2005 2004 and 2003 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 25 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense for us plans by approximately 470 expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the company’s longterm business forecasts based on this analysis the company’s estimate of expected longterm compensation increases for its us plans was 40 in 2005 2004 and 2003 increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits based on this longterm corporate bond yield at september 30 2005 the company’s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities the company selected a discount rate for its domestic plans of 550 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 25 in the company’s discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately 995 and 11110 respectively in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers accounting for pensions” actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date in 2005 and 2004 the company recorded a minimum pension liability for its us plans of 53329 and 43196 respectively this amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded

financial risk management 

 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could 

result in an approximate 9200 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction 

 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts other than as set forth above the company does not hedge foreign currency exposures the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts 

 

at december 25 2005 the company had fixed rate longterm debt including current portions and excluding fair value adjustments of 527726 at december 25 2005 the company had fixedforfloating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 100000 the interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of longterm debt at december 25 2005 these contracts had a fair value of 663 with 636 included in other assets and the remaining 27 included in prepaid expenses and other current assets with corresponding fair value adjustments to increase longterm debt and current portions of longterm debt respectively changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 15900 or 13600 respectively a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2006 pretax earnings and cash flows by 729 and 375 respectively 

 

the economy and inflation 

 

the company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2005 the principal market for the company’s products is the retail sector revenues from the company’s top 5 customers all retailers accounted for approximately 53 50 and 52 of its consolidated net revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in the past two years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

 

the company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year and within that half the fourth quarter to be more significant to its overall business for the full year the company expects that this concentration will continue particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year the concentration of sales in the second half of the year and specifically the fourth quarter increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas 

 

quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus 

negatively impacting the company’s revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the company’s future revenues 

 

the effect of inflation on the company’s operations during 2005 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly

operations 

the company primarily sources production through unrelated manufacturers in various far east countries principally china using a hong kong based subsidiary for quality control and order coordination purposes see manufacturing and importing below 

retail 

the company has a segment that operates approximately 80 retail stores under the wizards of the coast and game keeper names many of which not only sell a wide range of games but also provide locations for tournaments and other organized play activities 

other information 

the company has another segment which generates revenue through the licensing of certain of the companys intellectual property to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses 

to further extend its range of products in its various segments the company has hong kong units which market directly to retailers a line of high quality low priced toys games and related products primarily on a direct import basis direct sales to these customers are reflected in the revenue of the segment in which the product sold resides 

in addition various products are licensed to other companies for sale in certain countries where the company does not otherwise have a presence 

during the 2002 and 2001 fiscal years there was no line of products whose revenues individually accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenues during the 2000 fiscal year revenues from the pokemon trading card line of products contributed 15 of consolidated net revenues of the company 

working capital requirements 

the companys working capital needs have primarily been financed through cash from normal operations and when necessary shortterm borrowings which reach peak levels during september through november of each year when receivables also generally reach peak levels the revenue pattern of the company results in the second half of the year being more significant to its overall business and within that half the fourth quarter being the most prominent the trend of retailers over the past few years has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas the company 

expects that this trend will continue the toy business is also characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which the company has licenses for promotional product and differences in overall economic conditions as a result comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily indicative of sales for that entire given year also quick response inventory management practices now being used result in fewer orders being placed in advance of shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery the companys unshipped orders at march 2 2003 and march 3 2002 were approximately 2166 million and 1953 million respectively also it is a general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment the backlog at any date in a given year can be affected by programs the company may employ to induce its customers to place orders and accept shipments early in the year this method is a general industry practice the programs the company is employing to promote sales in 2003 are not substantially different from those employed in 2002 

the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected makes it necessary for the company to borrow varying amounts during the year during 2002 and 2001 the company utilized cash from operations and borrowing under its secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements the companys committed line at the end of 2002 included a secured revolving credit agreement of 380000 maturing in march 2005 the facility is secured by substantially all domestic accounts receivable and inventory as well as certain intangible assets of the company the company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements and a number of other limitations including with respect to capital expenditures investments acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants throughout the fiscal year ended december 29 2002 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its secured revolving credit agreement at march 2 2003 amounts available and unused under uncommitted lines at march 2 2003 were approximately 55000 during 2000 the company borrowed through the issuance of commercial paper and against shortterm lines of credit to fund its seasonal working capital requirements in excess of funds available from operations and the issuance of longterm debt 

royalties research and development 

the continuing development of new products and the redesigning of existing items for continued market acceptance are key determinants of success in the toy and game industry in 2002 2001 and 2000 153775 125633 and 208485 respectively were incurred on activities relating to the development design and engineering of new products and their packaging including items brought to the company by independent designers and to the improvement or modification of ongoing products much of this work is performed by the companys internal staff of designers artists model makers and engineers 

in addition to its own staff the company deals with a number of independent toy and game designers for whose designs and ideas the company competes with other toy and game manufacturers rights to such designs and ideas when acquired by the company are usually 

exclusive under agreements requiring the company to pay the designer a royalty on the companys net sales of the item these designer royalty agreements in some cases provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees 

the company also produces a number of toys under trademarks and copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from familiar movies television shows and other entertainment media for whose rights the company competes with other toy and game manufacturers licensing fees are generally paid as a royalty on the companys net sales of the item licenses for the use of characters are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories in many instances advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by character license agreements under terms of currently existing agreements in certain circumstances the company may be required to pay an aggregate of 309000 in guaranteed or minimum royalties in 2003 and thereafter the company has approximately 42500 of prepaid royalties which are a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet included in other assets is 161000 representing the longterm portion of advances paid of the unpaid guaranty hasbro may be required to pay approximately 91000 68000 97000 16000 12000 and 25000 in 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 and thereafter respectively amounts paid and advances to be paid relate to anticipated revenues in the years 2003 through 2018 

marketing and sales 

the companys products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers including wholesalers distributors chain stores discount stores mail order houses catalog stores department stores and other traditional retailers large and small as well as internetbased etailers the company and its subsidiaries employ their own sales forces which account for the majority of sales of their products remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell the companys products principally in areas of the world where the company does not otherwise maintain a presence with the acquisition of wizards of the coast inc in the fourth quarter of 1999 the company acquired a specialized line of retail stores featuring game hobby and related products and an area for instore game play as well as an online retail site the company maintains showrooms in selected major cities worldwide as well as at most of its subsidiary locations although the company had more than 4000 customers in the united states and canada during 2002 including specialty retailers carrying trading card games and toyrelated product there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years and the majority of the companys sales are to large chain stores distributors and wholesalers in other countries the company has active customers in excess of 7500 many of which are individual retail stores during 2002 sales to the companys two largest customers walmart stores inc and toys r us inc represented 19 and 16 respectively of consolidated net revenues and sales to its top five customers accounted for approximately 52 of consolidated net revenues 

the company advertises many of its toy and game products extensively on television the company generally advertises selected items in its product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of other specific items in those product groups the company conducts new product previews with many of its major customers in the months prior to showcasing the years new toys and games to the media at the american international toy fair in new york each february 

in 2002 the company spent 296549 in advertising promotion and marketing programs compared to 290829 in 2001 and 452978 in 2000 

manufacturing and importing 

during 2002 the companys products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east as well as in the companys own three facilities located in east longmeadow massachusetts waterford ireland and valencia spain most of its products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic paper and cardboard although certain products also make use of electronic components all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price the companys manufacturing processes include injection molding blow molding spray painting printing box making and assembly the company purchases certain components and accessories used in its toys and games and some finished items from united states manufacturers as well as from manufacturers in the far east which is the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and other countries the 1996 implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many products imported by the company the company believes that the manufacturing capacity of third party manufacturers as well as its own facilities and the supply of components accessories and completed products which it purchases from unaffiliated manufacturers are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2003 for the products which it markets the companys reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply for products it sells should such changes be necessary 

however if the company is prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of its current far east suppliers due to political labor or other factors beyond its control the companys operations would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by the company or the loss of normal trade relations status by the peoples republic of china could significantly increase the cost of the companys products imported into the united states or europe 

the company makes its own tools and fixtures for its manufacturing facilities but purchases dies and molds principally from independent united states and international sources 

competition 

the company is a worldwide leader in the design manufacture and marketing of games and toys the companys business is highly competitive and it competes with several large toy companies primarily mattel inc as well as many small united states and international designers manufacturers and marketers competition is based primarily on consumer preferences and quality and to a lesser extent pricing the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups 

employees 

at december 29 2002 the company employed approximately 7200 persons worldwide approximately 4200 of whom are located in the united states 

trademarks copyrights and patents 

the companys products are protected for the most part and in as many countries as practical by registered trademarks copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available cost effective and meaningful the loss of such rights concerning any particular product would not have a material adverse effect on the companys business although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect

volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the family entertainment industry makes it difficult to maintain the longterm success of existing product lines and consistently introduce successful new products in addition our inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely manner may damage our business 

our business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of our family entertainment products principally games and toys a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines or the failure of new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in reduced overall revenues and margins which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our continued success will depend on our ability to redesign restyle and extend our existing family entertainment product lines and to develop introduce and gain customer acceptance of new family entertainment product lines however consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to predict individual family entertainment products generally and high technology products in particular often have short life cycles the success of entertainment properties released theatrically such as star wars or disney related productions can significantly affect revenues we derive from licensed product related to those properties in addition competition in the industry could adversely impact our ability to secure maintain and renew popular licenses on beneficial terms if at all and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design develop and market successful products the loss of ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position there can be no assurances that 

1 any of our current products or product lines will continue to be popular for any significant period of time 2 any property for which we have a significant license will achieve popularity 3 any new products and product lines introduced by us will achieve an adequate degree of market acceptance 4 any new products life cycle will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover development manufacturing marketing royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of the product or 5 we will be able to manufacture source and ship new or continuing products in a timely basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands in developing new products and product lines we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions when we state that we will introduce or anticipate introducing a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated schedule unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process or significant increases in the planned cost of development may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or in some situations may cause a product introduction to be discontinued any delay or cancellation of planned product development and introduction may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 

our failure to successfully anticipate identify and react to consumer preferences in family entertainment could have an adverse effect on our revenues profitability and results of operations 

our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend in large part on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season further this seasonality is increasing as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response management techniques 

sales of our family entertainment products at retail are seasonal with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season which includes christmas this seasonality is increasing as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response management techniques these customers are timing reorders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers which to a large extent occurs during september through december rather than maintaining large onhand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand while these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales additionally the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods will increase the risk that we fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the year prior to the holiday season and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in our underproducing popular items andor overproducing less popular items which would have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business we would be significantly and adversely affected by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or a military engagement that negatively affect the retail environment or consumer buying patterns if such events were to impact a key selling season 

the continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 

we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products for the fiscal year ended december 29 2002 walmart stores inc and toys r us inc accounted for approximately 19 and 16 respectively of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers including walmart and toys r us in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net revenues if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us cease doing business with us significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retailers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 

we may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions or these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization our ability to make acquisitions is limited by our credit agreement 

acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth over the years and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings although we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products we cannot be certain that the products of companies we acquire will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in some cases we expect that the integration of the product lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production marketing and other operating synergies we believe that these synergies can create greater revenue growth and profitability and where applicable cost savings operating efficiencies and other advantages however we cannot be certain that these synergies efficiencies and cost 

savings will be realized even if achieved these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization in other cases we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management in which case we plan to create synergies by operating them autonomously rather than integrating them into our operations we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services 

because of limitations in our credit agreement we are limited in our ability to make substantial acquisitions in the near term although we plan to continue our focus and expend significant resources on our core owned and controlled brands we cannot assure you that such efforts will produce revenue growth to replace the growth historically provided by acquisitions 

our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks normally associated with international operations 

we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states for the year ended december 29 2002 our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 35 of our total consolidated net revenues we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues additionally we utilize thirdparty manufacturers located principally in the far east and we have manufacturing facilities in ireland and spain these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations including 

1 currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations 2 limitations including taxes on the repatriation of earnings 3 political instability civil unrest and economic instability 4 greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 5 complications in complying with laws in varying jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies 6 natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in recovering therefrom 7 transportation delays and interruptions and 8 the imposition of tariffs our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be shifted over a period of time to alternative sources of supply should such changes be necessary however if we were prevented from obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political labor or other factors beyond our control our operations would be disrupted while alternative sources of products were secured also the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us or the loss of normal trade relations status by the peoples republic of china could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if any of the risks described above were to occur 

we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 

an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various theatrical releases such as star wars and disney the license agreements usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial and in some cases may be greater than what we are able to recoup from actual sales which could result in writeoffs of such amounts that would adversely effect our results of operations in addition acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal or missing business opportunities for new licenses as a licensee we have no guaranty that a particular brand will be a successful toy or game product we anticipate that the continuing trend toward shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to sell licensed products based on these entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize inventory risk furthermore there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses our revenues and profits may be adversely effected 

our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 

our intellectual property including our license agreements and other agreements which establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property are of great value we rely on a combination of trade secret copyright trademark patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to this valuable intellectual property related to our brands from time to time third parties have challenged and may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in addition our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights we may need to resort to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position 

we are involved in certain litigation arbitration and regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 

as is the case with many large multinational corporations we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations litigation and arbitration disputes because the outcome of litigation arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict it is possible that the outcome of such matters could entail significant expense 

during 2001 we received two inquiries from the office of fair trading in the united kingdom the oft into allegedly anticompetitive pricing practices by our united kingdom subsidiary hasbro uk ltd hasbro uk the first of the inquiries the wholesaler case begun in may of 2001 related to hasbro uks interactions with certain of its wholesale distributors the second inquiry the retailer case begun in august of 2001 related to hasbro uks trading arrangements with certain of its direct retail accounts 

on november 29 2002 the oft issued a decision in the wholesaler case finding that hasbro uk had entered into agreements with certain distributors to fix prices in violation of uk competition laws the oft assessed a fine in that case of approximately gbp 4950 or 

approximately 7900 at the then current exchange rates we filed an appeal of this decision in january 2003 to the uk competition commission appeals tribunal the ccat 

in light of the ofts decision in the wholesaler case we recorded a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 of gbp 4787 or 7566 at applicable exchange rates this resulted in a total amount accrued at december 29 2002 of gbp 4947 or 7935 at yearend exchange rates 

on february 19 2003 the oft issued a decision in the retailer case finding that hasbro uk had entered into agreements with certain direct retailers to fix prices in violation of uk competition laws the oft assessed a fine in this case but due to our cooperation in the ofts investigation the ofts decision stated that we would not be required to pay any of that fine 

on march 3 2003 we withdrew our appeal of the wholesaler case with the ccat 

we rely on external financing including our credit facility to maintain our operations if we are unable to obtain or service such financing or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome our business would be negatively affected 

due to the seasonal nature of our business in order to meet our working capital needs particularly those prior to the fourth quarter we rely on our credit facility in march 2002 we entered into an amended and restated secured revolving credit agreement with existing and new lenders which provides for a 380 million revolving credit facility this facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic accounts receivable and inventory as well as certain of our intangible assets the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements and a number of other limitations including restrictions on capital expenditures investments acquisitions share repurchases incurrence of indebtedness and dividend payments these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions and financial operating and strategic flexibility in addition our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants if we were unable to meet our financial covenants or if we failed to comply with other covenants in our credit facility we could face significant negative consequences 

we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our cash and access to existing credit facilities are adequate for current and planned needs in 2003 however our actual experience may differ from these expectations factors that may lead to a difference include but are not limited to the matters discussed herein as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 

we also may choose to finance our capital needs from time to time through the issuance of debt securities our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms if at all will depend on the state of our business and financial condition any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies market interest rates and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future fluctuations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities the failure to receive financing on desirable terms or at all could adversely affect our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 

as of december 29 2002 we had approximately 1063 million of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding this total indebtedness includes the 250 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures which we issued in 2001 if we are unable to generate 

sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms or at all on december 1 2005 december 1 2011 and december 1 2016 and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes holders of the 275 senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures at that time the purchase price may be paid in cash shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash however we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required repurchases 

in january 2003 we amended warrants previously granted to lucas licensing ltd lucas the warrant amendment agreement provides lucas with an option through january 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us for a price to be paid at our election of either 100 million in cash or 110 million in our common stock such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option should we be required to settle the warrants under this option we believe that we will have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary however we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required payment 

market conditions government actions and regulations and other third party conduct could negatively impact implementation of our consolidation programs margins and other business initiatives 

economic conditions such as rising fuel and raw material prices or transportation costs may adversely impact our margins in addition general economic conditions were significantly and negatively affected by the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and other conflicts or the prospect of such events such a weakened economic and business climate as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate could adversely affect our sales and profitability other conditions such as the unavailability of electrical components may impede our ability to manufacture source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis additional factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost of implementing our consolidation programs or alter our actions and reduce actual results also work stoppages slowdowns or strikes or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product

eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives the elimination of this amortization and its related tax effect had sfas 142 been applied in 2001 and 2000 would have increased net earnings by 45013 and 46934 respectively and diluted earnings per share by 26 and 27 respectively also favorably impacting the 2002 net loss was interest income net of tax of 7556 received on an irs tax settlement in 2002

consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 29 2002 were 2816230 compared to 2856339 in 2001 and 3787215 in 2000 most of the companys revenues and operating earnings result from its three principal segments us toys games and international in 2002 the company reclassified its segment results for 2001 and 2000 to reflect the realignment of certain operating divisions us tiger toy lines previously included in the games segment are now included in the us toys segment certain tiger electronic games primarily handheld remain in the games segment in addition the international operations of tiger and wizards of the coast previously included in games are now included as part of the international segment 

us toys 

net revenues in the us toys segment increased by 7 over 2001 to 996496 in 2002 the increase is due primarily to sales of product in connection with the theatrical release of star wars episode ii attack of the clones in may 2002 and the video and dvd release in november of 2002 in addition revenues were positively impacted by increased shipments of products related to certain core brands such as gi joe transformers and playskool products as well as the introduction of beyblades products these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of electronic interactive products such as bio bugs and poochi remote control toys and to a lesser extent pokemon products and ekara in addition prior year sales were favorably affected by the 2001 theatrical and video releases of jurassic park iii and disneys monsters inc us toys operating profit for the year ended december 29 2002 was 75664 compared with 15808 in the prior year the increase in operating profit was largely due to higher gross margins as the result of the mix of products sold in 2002 versus 2001 the increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased royalty expense resulting from higher sales of licensed products in 2002 primarily star wars products in addition to this operating profit was positively impacted by lower sales and administration costs in 2002 as a result of the companys focus on cost reduction and more effective management resulting from the consolidation of the us toys segment into essentially one location a process begun in 2000 as noted above gross margin and 

royalty expense increased in 2002 because of increased sales of entertainment based products principally star wars products sales of product related to entertainmentbased properties such as star wars typically carry a higher gross margin as well as a higher royalty rate with the resulting operating profit generally lower than it is for revenues derived from sales of hasbro owned brands higher amortization expense in 2002 relating to the product rights associated with star wars was offset by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and product rights deemed to have an indefinite life as the result of the companys adoption of sfas 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 in 2003 the company does not expect a theatrical video or dvd release of a star wars property as a result the company expects royalty and amortization expenses to decrease in 2003 reflecting the anticipated reduction of sales of entertainment based licensed products 

net revenues in the us toys segment in 2001 decreased to 935530 from 1040893 in 2000 this decline in revenues was primarily the result of decreased sales of pokemon and furby products partially offset by revenues related to the 2001 theatrical worldwide release of jurassic park iii and the us release of monsters inc as well as sales from bob the builder products us toys segment 2001 operating profit was 15808 an increase from an operating loss of 151866 in 2000 this increase despite the decrease in revenues was the result of higher gross margin resulting primarily from lower obsolescence charges in 2001 lower royalty expense due to the mix of sales which included increased sales of nonlicensed products and cost reductions related to the 2000 consolidation programs and other cost reduction initiatives of the company 

games 

games segment revenues declined 8 in 2002 to 739782 from 2001 levels of 801467 the decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of trading card games primarily pokemon and to a lesser extent harry potter and magic the gathering as well as decreased sales of electronic games these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of trivial pursuit resulting from the introduction of the 20th anniversary edition games segment operating profit decreased to 124523 in 2002 from 156089 in 2001 the decrease in operating profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenues as well as increased product development expenses these factors were partially offset by a decrease in selling distribution and administration expenses largely due to the companys cost reduction initiatives as well as decreased intangible amortization expense resulting from the companys adoption of sfas 142 which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives 

games segment revenues for 2001 decreased to 801467 from 2000 revenues of 1186594 this decrease was mainly due to declines in revenues from pokemon products as well as the impact of the sale of hasbro interactive and gamescom business units in january 2001 these decreases were partially offset by increases in magic the gathering revenues as well as sales from products derived from the combination of certain core brands and key licenses such as the disney edition of monopoly operating profit of 156089 in 2001 increased from 87992 in 2000 this increase was the result of the sale of hasbro interactive and gamescom which incurred operating losses in 2000 

international 

international segment revenues decreased 3 from 2001 to 970825 in 2002 decreases relating to pokemon and jurassic park iii products were mostly offset by increased sales of star wars products disney products resulting from the international release of monsters inc in 2002 and beyblades products changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted international segment revenues by approximately 34700 international operating profit decreased to 5177 in 2002 from 28658 in 2001 operating profit was negatively 

impacted by a fine against the company by the oft in 2002 for alleged anticompetitive pricing practices which resulted in a charge of 7566 in the fourth quarter as well as increased product development expenses as the result of the companys increased focus on developing its core brands increased gross margins were largely offset by higher royalty expenses resulting from increased sales of entertainment based licensed properties primarily star wars products overall pretax earnings were favorably impacted by the weaker us dollar by approximately 4700 the result of higher translated us dollar gross margins offset somewhat by higher translated us dollar expenses 

international revenues were 996266 in 2001 compared to 1451279 in 2000 this decrease was caused primarily by the decline in sales of pokemon and furby products international operating profit in 2001 of 28658 decreased from 129530 in 2000 primarily as the result of the decrease in sales 

other segments 

revenues from the retail segment which represents the retail operations of wizards of the coast were 48983 in 2002 compared with 51019 in 2001 the operating loss of this segment was 19877 in 2002 versus 36897 in 2001 the 2001 operating loss includes a charge of approximately 16000 associated with impairment of longlived assets revenues and operating loss in 2001 of 51019 and 36897 respectively compared with 57328 and 10452 respectively in 2000 

the company expects that revenues and related expenses of entertainmentbased products are higher in the year of a theatrical release since star wars episode ii attack of the clones was released theatrically worldwide in may 2002 the company expects a decrease in revenues relating to star wars products as well as corresponding decreases in amortization and royalty expense in 2003 

the companys gross profit margin increased in 2002 to 610 from 572 in 2001 which compares with 558 in 2000 the increase in margin primarily reflects product mix with increased sales of star wars and disney products partially offset by decreased sales of trading card games all of these products have higher than average gross margins the company has been actively reducing inventory levels during 2001 and 2002 and throughout 2002 has maintained lower levels of inventory to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence lower charges relating to obsolescence of inventory also contributed to margin growth from 2000 the companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items which could result in higher obsolescence costs in the future 

amortization expense of 94576 in 2002 compares with amortization of 121652 in 2001 and 157763 in 2000 the 2001 and 2000 amortization amounts include 53655 and 57286 respectively of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles that have been determined to have indefinite lives as noted above on december 31 2001 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 142 which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually when compared to adjusted amortization from 2001 the resulting increase in amortization expense in 2002 is for the most part the result of increased amortization of star wars product rights which are amortized in accordance with the expected sales curve of related products due to the fact that the company does not expect a star wars theatrical video or dvd release in 2003 the company expects amortization expense to decrease in 2003 during 2000 the 157763 of amortization expense included impairment charges of 25046 resulting from discontinued product line offerings arising from the companys decision to focus on developing its core brands 

royalty expense increased to 296152 or 105 of net revenues in 2002 from 209725 or 73 of net revenues in 2001 the increase is primarily related to increased sales of entertainmentbased product principally star wars related as the result of the theatrical video and dvd releases of star wars episode ii attack of the clones in 2002 2001 royalties of 209725 decreased sharply from 2000 royalties of 426881 royalties in 2000 included charges of 42270 relating to royalty commitments on discontinued product lines and product lines with significantly reduced expectations recognized in connection with the companys consolidation program absent these charges in 2000 royalty expenditures were approximately 73 and 102 of net revenues in 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in 2001 from 2000 is the result of decreased sales of licensed products primarily pokemon revenues derived from entertainment based properties such as star wars and resultant royalties while continuous over the life of a contract are generally higher in amount in the year a theatrical release takes place the degree to which revenues royalties and operating profits fluctuate is dependent not only on theatrical release dates but video and dvd release dates as well the company does not expect a theatrical video or dvd release of a star wars property in 2003 and as a result anticipates that royalty expense will decrease in 2003 as it continues to focus on its core brands 

expenditures for research and product development were 153775 in 2002 compared to 125633 in 2001 and 208485 in 2000 as percentages of net revenues research and product development was 55 in 2002 compared to 44 in 2001 and 55 in 2000 absent the impact of costs associated with the business units sold to infogrames research and development expense would have been 39 in 2000 the increase in 2002 relates to the companys continued focus on product innovation as part of its strategy to develop its core brands the decrease in dollars in 2001 from 2000 primarily is the result of the sale of hasbro interactive and gamescom business units and to a lesser extent the companys focus on reduced spending and synergies achieved from centralizing the us toys segment development team into one location 

advertising expense in 2002 increased to 296549 or 105 of net revenues compared to 290829 or 102 of net revenues in 2001 but decreased from 452978 or 120 of net revenues in 2000 included in 2000 expense is 3155 related to contractual commitments on discontinued product lines arising from the companys 2000 consolidation program the decrease from 2000 levels results from lower expenditures coinciding with lower revenues lower media costs and a more efficient use of advertising spending the company expects advertising expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 as it increases promotion of its core brands 

selling distribution and administration costs decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2002 to 656725 or 233 of net revenues from 675482 or 236 in 2001 this decrease is primarily due to the companys cost reduction efforts decreases resulting from these cost reduction efforts were partially offset by a charge of 7566 in 2002 relating to a fine assessed by the oft against the company for alleged anticompetitive pricing practices decreases in 2002 selling distribution and administration expenses were also partly offset by charges in 2002 for ongoing cost reductions that are expected to benefit the company in 2003 and thereafter selling distribution and administration costs decreased to 675482 in 2001 from 863496 in 2000 but increased as a percentage of net revenues to 236 in 2001 from 227 in 2000 the increase as a percentage of net revenues was largely due to decreased revenues in 2001 the decrease in dollars is primarily attributable to the business units sold to infogrames in january 2001 and reductions in marketing sales and administration expenses related to expense reduction programs the company is continuing its focus on reducing expenses in this area in 2003 and does not anticipate an increase in selling distribution and administration costs in dollars or as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 

in the fourth quarter of 2000 the company implemented a plan to consolidate its us toys group into rhode island significantly reduce overhead through reductions in product development sales and marketing and administrative functions across the company and to increase its focus on development of the companys core brands in 2000 the company recorded a total of 152270 in expense relating to this plan 70079 of restructuring expense and 82191 of expense in other operating categories including 6625 to cost of sales 25046 in amortization 42270 in royalties 3155 in advertising and 5095 in selling distribution and administration expense the significant components of the 2000 plan included the closing of three offices thereby essentially consolidating the us toys group in rhode island as well as the reduction of overhead overhead reductions were concentrated in marketing and sales product development and administration including a curtailment of expansion of the retail business of wizards of the coast the further consolidation of certain international operating offices into regional centers and consolidation and streamlining of the companys marketing activities these actions were completed in 2001 and resulted in a restructuring credit of 1795 due to lower than expected severance costs necessary to complete the plan the 2000 plan also included the refocus of the company on developing and marketing its core brands and reducing its reliance on licensed properties this focus resulted in product lines which were discontinued or for which the company has significantly reduced expectations 

the components of the plan included in the restructuring charge of 70100 in the 2000 statement of operations were severance costs of 31800 lease costs of 21400 and fixed asset writeoffs of 16900 fixed asset writeoffs were recorded in 2000 remaining balances accrued at december 29 2002 include 500 of severance benefits remaining to be paid to terminated employees over their remaining entitlement period and 2600 of lease payments remaining on closed facilities 

total charges under the 2000 plan represented cash charges of approximately 31800 for severance benefits disbursed over the employees entitlement period 21400 for lease costs to be expended over the contractual lease term of the closed facilities and approximately 31100 of contractual commitments on exited product lines and certain other licensed product lines with reduced expectations due to the companys enhanced focus on its core brands the product lines exited were not either individually or in the aggregate material to the companys revenues or operating results total noncash charges were 62900 noncash charges of 16900 for fixed asset writeoffs related primarily to corporate and the us toys segment the remaining approximately 46000 relates to asset writeoffs and a writedown of assets impaired due to the companys enhanced focus on its core brands this also included impairment of intangible assets arising from the decision to discontinue product line offerings noncash charges associated with asset writeoffs were credited to the respective line items on the balance sheet in 2000 while the company realized benefits from the consolidation of operations and focus on core product lines throughout its income statement it achieved pretax savings directly related to specific actions under the restructuring plan of 52000 in 2002 

as noted above in december 2000 the company entered into an agreement to sell certain business units comprising hasbro interactive as well as its internet portal gamescom to infogrames for infogrames securities and cash the sale of the business units closed in january 2001 net assets of the business units sold were written down to estimated fair value as of december 31 2000 resulting in the recognition of a pretax loss of 43965 during 2001 the company was engaged in arbitration proceedings with infogrames regarding a dispute over the amount of postclosing adjustments to the sales proceeds in connection with this sale the dispute was settled with no material adjustments to the companys results of operations proceeds from the sale were 56200 of which 1000 was in cash 1000 was in redeemable preferred stock of hasbro interactive and the remainder was in common stock of infogrames during 2002 the 

company recognized charges relating to the other than temporary decline in the value of this common stock which is detailed further below 

interest expense decreased to 77499 in 2002 from 103688 in 2001 and 114421 in 2000 approximately 53 of the decrease in 2002 as compared to 2001 is due to decreased average borrowing rates predominantly the result of the issuance of 250000 of 275 convertible senior debentures in november 2001 the proceeds of which were used to repurchase debt with higher interest rates also contributing to the decreased average rates in 2002 were several interest rate swap agreements initiated in the second quarter of 2002 to adjust the amount of the companys total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates the remainder of the decrease in interest is due to decreased average borrowings in 2002 primarily reflecting decreased shortterm borrowings in 2002 as well as the repurchase of 124585 in principal amount of 795 notes due march 2003 during the last three quarters of 2002 the decrease in 2001 from 2000 is due primarily to decreased shortterm borrowings at december 29 2002 200288 in principal amount of the 795 notes due march 2003 remained outstanding in march 2003 the company repaid these notes as a result the company expects interest expense to continue to decrease in 2003 

other expense of 37704 in 2002 compares to other expense of 11443 in 2001 and 7288 in 2000 the 2002 amount includes a 42902 writedown of the value of the common stock of infogrames entertainment sa held by the company as an availableforsale investment this charge was partially offset by interest income on a tax settlement of 10211 received in the second quarter of 2002 the 2001 amount reflects a lower level of interest income coupled with an increase in losses on foreign currency transactions including the impact of the argentine peso devaluation expense in 2000 relates primarily to the writedown of investments held for sale which have experienced an other than temporary decline in value coupled with a higher level of transactional losses resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency 

income tax expense was 279 of pretax earnings in 2002 compared with 368 in 2001 absent the effect of the oft penalty the 2002 tax rate would have been 26 income tax benefit on the 2000 pretax loss was 360 the decrease in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to the adoption of sfas 142 which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have an indefinite life the increase in 2001 from 2000 reflects the tax impact of operating losses in jurisdictions where benefits were not realizable 

on december 31 2001 the first day of fiscal 2002 the company adopted sfas 142 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill as well as amortization of intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life under this statement goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of fair value of a reporting unit the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists completion of step one identified that the us toys reporting unit had a fair value which was less than its carrying value indicating a need for a step two analysis no other reporting units required step two procedures after allocating the fair value of the us toys reporting unit to its assets and liabilities the remaining value was insufficient to cover goodwill by 296223 goodwill of the us toys reporting unit was impaired by this amount this impairment is included in results for 2002 net of related tax impact of 50491 the company performed its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and no impairment was indicated 

during 2001 the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which required that the company record all derivatives such as foreign exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings aoce until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a result of adopting statement 133 and in accordance with the transition provisions the company recorded a onetime after tax charge of 1066 during 2001 representing the cumulative effect of the adoption in its consolidated statements of operations and an after tax unrealized loss of 753 to aoce which the company reclassified to earnings in 2001

critical accounting policies and significant estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances inventory valuation recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 

sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue from product sales when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of title to the customer at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon a consideration of quantities on hand actual and projected sales volume anticipated product selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued slowmoving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 

on december 31 2001 the first day of fiscal 2002 the company adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminates the amortization of goodwill as well as amortization of intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life under this statement goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to applicable reporting units goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually goodwill is tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows the first step is a 

screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the income approach in connection with the adoption of sfas 142 the company recorded an impairment charge of 245732 net of tax primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method the companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and no impairment was indicated at december 29 2002 the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of 536731 recorded on the balance sheet 

intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows the preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 636408 at december 29 2002 

the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to writeoff the remaining minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 29 2002 the company had 203500 of prepaid royalties 42500 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 161000 which are included in other assets 

the company except for certain international subsidiaries has pension plans covering substantially all of its fulltime employees pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets expected salary increases and applicable discount rates the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information and in light of recent decreases in historical average market returns the company reduced its expected return on plan assets in 2002 to 875 versus 900 used in 2001 and 2000 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense expected salary increases are estimated using a combination of historical salary increases with expected salary increases in the companys longterm business forecasts based on this analysis the company reduced expected salary increases in 2002 to 40 from 45 used in 2001 and 2000 increases in estimated salary increases would increase pension expense while decreases 

would decrease pension expense discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the company considers moodys longterm aa corporate bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate at september 30 2002 the companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities the moodys longterm corporate bond yield was 651 and the company selected a discount rate of 650 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense primarily as the result of the changes in these assumptions the company expects its pension expense in 2003 to increase by approximately 4500 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 employers accounting for pensions actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if in excess of a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date in 2002 the company recorded a minimum pension liability of 44811 this amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded the company does not expect the changes in assumptions to impact its funding requirements in 2003 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

in the normal course of its business the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license which may require the payment of minimum guarantees as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment in addition the company has 1042856 of longterm debt including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments outstanding at december 29 2002 future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows

in additional to the contractual obligations noted above the company has letters of credit of approximately 38000 at december 29 2002 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the most part as the result of sourcing products in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than thirty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar versus the hong 

kong dollar euro british pound canadian dollar and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies including those in latin american countries 

to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its estimated upcoming fiscal year foreign currency transactions first and foremost by using forward foreign exchange contracts and to a lesser extent zero cost option collars from time to time the company may also hedge foreign currency exposure using purchased foreign currency options the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 unfavorable movement in the us dollar could result in an approximate 70 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates the company does not speculate in and other than set forth above the company does not hedge foreign currencies the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 

at december 29 2002 the company had fixed rate longterm debt including current installments of 1059115 the company entered into several interest rate swap agreements in 2002 with a total notional amount of 350000 to adjust the amount of longterm debt subject to fixed interest rates the interest rate swaps are matched with specific longterm debt obligations these interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges of the underlying debt changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the longterm debt hedged by the interest rate swaps the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this longterm debt by approximately 68000 or 59000 respectively a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2003 pretax earnings and cash flows by 1671 and 1015 respectively 

the economy and inflation 

the company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2002 the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top 5 customers all retailers accounted for approximately 52 and 48 of its consolidated net revenues in 2002 and 2001 respectively in the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 

the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year being more significant to its overall business the trend of retailers over the past few years has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season which includes christmas to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues 

the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2002 was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly
