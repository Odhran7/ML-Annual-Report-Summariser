servicenow was founded on a simple premise a better technology platform will help work flow better the company’s purpose is to make the world work better for everyone we help global enterprises across industries universities and governments to digitize their workflows—the individual tasks that need to be executed to get a job done our technology platform which we refer to as the now platform enables us to connect systems silos departments and processes with digital workflows that are simple and easy to use we categorize the workflows we provide into four primary areas information technology “it” employee customer and creator as discussed in more detail below our it workflows give it departments the ability to plan build operate and service across the entire it lifecycle our employee workflows help customers simplify how their employees get the services they need creating a familiar consumerlike way to get work done from wherever an employee may be—at home in the workplace or in the field our customer workflows help organizations reimagine the customer experience and increase customer loyalty our creator workflows enable our customers to quickly create test and deploy their own applications on the now platform 

traditionally business processes have been automated and embedded across enterprise technology systems from finance to human resources “hr” to sales customer support and beyond over time these systems have become disconnected siloed and complex often limiting flexibility and adaptability and lacking the intuition and empowerment of technologies created for the individual consumer servicenow is changing these limitations we offer the capability to quickly change how work is done to keep pace with a rapidly changing environment the now platform delivers a simple userfriendly experience making work easier faster and more fulfilling we believe a better service experience is the ultimate desired outcome of digital transformation 

the now platform is uniquely positioned to enable our customers’ digital transformation from nonintegrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities the transformation to digital operations enabled by the now platform increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers 

the company’s success began with information technology service management “itsm” a category in which servicenow has become a market leader over time we expanded beyond our itsm capabilities to meet the needs of our customer’s expanding digital requirements to modernize technology operations employee experiences customer experiences industryspecific challenges and application development and integration we are now recognized as a leader for multiple products across our it employee customer and creator workflows 

the now platform’s taskbased orientation allows work to be done with a single aligned view of every service experience for example a new employee uses servicenow to complete onboarding tasks with their new employer the new employee is interfacing through an integrated servicenow experience whether tasks originate from servicenow or other systems similarly customer service can be executed in a way that solves problems without creating frustration 

over the years we have expanded our customer base and our customers have expanded their use of the now platform for example many companies now have multiyear digital transformation plans many of which heavily involve introducing uses of additional servicenow products and services from a single outofthebox solution companies recognize the value of using additional products to strengthen the richness and quality of their data running through the now platform as we help organizations realize more value from the now platform and better serve their stakeholders we do so in a manner that also helps organizations accelerate their environmental social and governance “esg” ambitions to serve the growing focus on esg servicenow also offers an integrated esg solution on the now platform as part of our it workflows

competition

• enterprise application software vendors  we designed the now platform to quickly integrate with and complement the performance of wellestablished enterprise application software vendors such as oracle sap salesforce and workday customers may choose to work directly with their application software vendors to improve integrations and create connected workflows 

• new technologies and entrants  markets are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry new technologies and competitors are entering the markets to solve similar problems in different ways intensifying competition customers may choose alternative technologies to improve integrations and create connected workflows 

• inhouse solutions  many customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses customers may choose to work with their internal it departments or other personnel to build custom workflow solutions and integrations 

• cloudbased vendors  as businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and softwareasaservice “saas”based offerings they are adopting a hybrid onpremise and offpremise approach for their existing and new compute workloads as a result our services will need to increasingly compete for customers’ hybrid it workloads with offpremises public cloud and saasbased offerings additionally our offerings may compete with offerings from various public cloud providers many of these cloud providers are partnering with onpremise hardware vendors to deliver their cloud platform as an onpremise solution 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of us and international copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property “ip” rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services in certain of our partnership arrangements our partners may develop technology on the now platform that may be subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights that we agree to with the partner 

we continue to grow our global patent portfolio and ip rights that relate to our platform applications services research and development and other activities our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip as of december 31 2021 we had over 2150 us and foreign patents including patents acquired from third parties and over 850 pen ding patent applications we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other ip right or group of related patents or ip rights we file patent applications to protect our ip and have and may continue to acquire additional patents patent portfolios or patent applications see “risk factors—lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results” and “risk factors—our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results” for additional information

foundational principles 

• we must always honor servicenow’s authentic culture and purpose as we continue to grow 

• we must ensure that our people strategy is informed by data and insights as we strive to scale efficiently and make informed and unbiased decisions 

key pillars 

• scale and innovation we need to build and innovate around a talent engine that attracts grows and retains the best people who will drive our business and mission forward our talent engine puts our people at the center and is rooted in processes data and systems that allow us to be efficient and cost effective 

• inclusive employee experience we need to foster an inclusive culture in which all of our people feel a deep sense of belonging and can be their authentic self the experience our employees have at servicenow is a critical factor in retaining and attracting top talent 

• growth and development we know from our employee surveys that our people have a deep desire for learning opportunities that will help them grow as individuals and as teams and ultimately help them grow our business as a result growth and development—from earlyincareer talent to senior leaders—are critical aspects of our people strategy 

our culture 

servicenow’s culture is grounded in our values first discussed above we live our culture by regularly listening to our people and gathering feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally we listen through our employee voice surveys “evs” which measures and analyzes employee engagement including on such topics as inclusion and belonging learning and development recognition pay and wellbeing evs insights are used to action plan at all levels of the organization and inform the assessment of our human capital management approach and its alignment with our company purpose and business strategy 

we also listen by gaining insights across the employee lifecycle through onboarding exit and other checkin surveys among other things our listening in 2021 gave us invaluable insights into ways we could best support employees through the covid19 pandemic and has fueled our future of work strategy and policies 

as a result we earned several external recognitions in 2021 that speak to our strong culture including from the fortune future 50 the fortune 100 best companies to work for and the great place to work’s 100 best workplaces for parents 

diversity equity and inclusion “dei” 

“creating belonging” is one of our four company values we expect each of our people to live our values both inside and outside of the work environment we have several initiatives focused on recruiting learning and development and culture to weave dei throughout our talent processes to drive sustainable progress as we strive to create a more diverse equitable and inclusive culture 

within servicenow we support multiple belonging groups for women racial and ethnic minorities military veterans people with disabilities people of different faiths and people who identify as lgbtqi these groups are intended to give employees a safe space and help support our culture and communitybuilding efforts across the company we also publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics in the various reports we issue that include information on gender race and ethnic minority representation in our us employee population 

we also create belonging in our communities our nextgen professional program a digital skills program building the next generation of servicenow certified professionals “nextgen” is creating generational diverse talent engines for our customers and partners this program builds critical skillsets for participants many of whom are traditionally marginalized by the technology industry in addition our partnership with benedict college in south carolina is deepening our relationships with the historically black colleges and universities hbcu community further servicenow’s 100 million racial equity fund was launched in january 2021 designed to drive more sustainable wealth creation by funding homeownership entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization within black communities in 10 regions across the united states it was fully deployed in december 2021 additionally in 2021 the employees of servicenow volunteered a total of approximately 19900 hours and donated a total of approximately 2 million our corporate giving including grants matching donations and rewards totaled approximately 10 million

pay equity 

everyone deserves to be treated fairly and respectfully we believe there should be equity across the entire talent ecosystem – from hiring through career advancement to achieve that we continue to build and scale equitable people practices that foster inclusive and fair outcomes for all employees this includes pay equity because pay equity is so dynamic at a highgrowth company like ours we manage it on an ongoing basis and do regular analyses and adjustments as warranted we are proud that our process led us to achieve systematic pay equity as of october 20 2021 our latest companywide analysis and helps ensure that we maintain pay equity on an ongoing basis 

wellbeing and safety 

servicenow is committed to supporting employee wellbeing and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives 

at the outset of the pandemic we quickly adopted a company policy encouraging all employees to work remotely and closed all of our offices including our headquarters except for certain critical positions throughout 2020 and 2021 we took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our global employees during the covid19 pandemic including implementing a pandemic medical leave policy providing a onetime wellness stipend and offering employees the choice to work remote we also hosted a series of speakers to help employees navigate through the challenging time in 2021 as covid19 peaked in countries across the world servicenow responded for example during the largest wave of the pandemic in india in the spring of 2021 servicenow provided our employees based in india oncampus vaccination drives virtual information sessions with doctors and other covid19 related medical benefits 

in addition to programs relating to covid19 our standard comprehensive benefits package covers many physical emotional and financial wellness programs from june to september 2021 we offered additional timeoff with “recharge halfday fridays” to further support the wellbeing of our global employees

new ways of working 

in october 2021 we announced our new future of work policy to support our people as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms embrace flexibility promote inclusion and drive innovation under this policy beginning in 2022 the majority of our employees are in a workplace three days or fewer a week which provides them flexibility to organize their schedules our flexible working environment will enable us to attract recruit and retain the best talent and we believe will only serve to strengthen our company our fullyremote workforce is also expected to continue to increase allowing us to tap into different more diverse talent who are not geographically close to a servicenow workplace

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

national and local governments or agencies have adopted and may continue to adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty or residency requirements concerning the location of data centers and support services as a cloudbased service provider we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers located in and support provided from different jurisdictions changing laws regulations and standards applying to the collection use sharing transfer or other processing of data including personal data could affect our ability to develop our products and services to maximize their utility as well as our customers’ ability to use data or share data with service providers such changes may restrict our ability to use store or otherwise process data of our customers in connection with providing and supporting our services in some cases this could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally 

compliance with and other obligations imposed by existing and upcoming laws globally including europe and state specific privacy laws in the united states “us” global trends to regulate the use of ai the ruling of the european court of justice in schrems v facebook ireland and interpretations of that ruling by regulators and customers recommendations issued by the european data protection board new standard contractual clauses issued by the european commission and other privacy data residency sovereignty and transfer laws regulations and standards including selfregulatory standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices andor policies may limit the development use and adoption of our services and could reduce overall demand for our services laws or regulations related to the use of ai technology may impact our ability to use certain data for developing our products and may also become an impediment to the adoption of our products for customers regulated by such laws and regulations recently we began offering a european union “eu” centric services delivery model by which customers may elect to receive support from eu‑based servicenow teams with an eu cloud‑hosted digital workflow solution this offering required a significant investment in financial and human resources and we may see similar requests for local solutions in other territories in addition actual or perceived noncompliance could result in proceedings or investigations against us by regulatory authorities or others lead to significant fines damages orders or reputational harm and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition 

and operating results 

changes in our developed or acquired products and how such products utilize data could also alter or increase our compliance requirements as a result our innovation and business drivers in developing or acquiring new and emerging technologies and the demand for our products could be impacted 

doing business with the public sector including us governments and agencies heavilyregulated organizations and governments globally subjects us to risks related to government procurement processes regulations and contracting requirements 

we provide products and services to the us federal state and local governments and heavilyregulated organizations directly and through our partners we have made and may continue to make significant investments to support future sales opportunities in various government sectors this includes obtaining and maintaining additional cloud security authorizations in the us for the servicenow government community cloud such as the us federal risk and authorization management program “fedramp” high provisional authority to operate “pato” from the joint authorization board and the us department of defense security requirements guide impact level 4 pato for cloud computing by the defense information systems agency we have also made significant investments to obtain security authorizations and certifications outside the us however government certification requirements may change or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more government certification or authorization including those mentioned above as a result if such requirements change our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we meet any revised requirements 

a substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities in the us have been made indirectly through our distributors resellers or service provider partners doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive timeconsuming and may be subject to political influence and may involve different rules and conditions on the offering or pricing of products and services we incur significant upfront time and expense which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs without any assurance that we or a thirdparty distributor reseller or service provider will win a contract beyond this demand for our products and services may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown or changes to government policy further if we or our partners are successful in receiving a contract award that award could be challenged during a bid protest process bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award even if a bid protest were unsuccessful the delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 

our customers also include nonus governments to which government procurement risks similar to those present in us government contracting and regulatory compliance also apply particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established we have seen challenges to successful awards through bid protest procedures in jurisdictions outside the us as our nonus government business grows we may see an increase in bid protests as part of the standard government procurement legal procedures that exist in many jurisdictions in addition compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources in certain jurisdictions our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition public sector customers may have contractual statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our thirdparty distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default though such risk may be assumed by such thirdparty distributor or reseller if a contract is terminated for convenience we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses if a contract is terminated due to a default we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities further we are required to comply with a variety of complex laws regulations and contractual provisions relating to the formation administration or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts these may include rights with respect to price protection refund and setoff the accuracy of information provided to the government contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies and other obligations that are particular to government contracts these obligations may apply to us andor our thirdparty resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control such parties’ noncompliance could impose repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues 

in addition governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements if from an audit it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits cost associated with the triggering of price 

reduction clauses fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business all of which may cause us to suffer reputational harm 

further we are increasingly doing business in heavily regulated industries such as the financial services telecommunication media and television and health care industries current and prospective customers in such industries may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding thirdparty vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers in addition regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward thirdparty vendors that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet in addition customers in these heavilyregulated industries often have a right to conduct audits of our systems products and practices if one or more customer determines that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business 

if we fail to comply with applicable anticorruption and antibribery laws export control or global trade laws we could be subject to penalties and civil andor criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will inevitably do more business with large enterprises and the public sector in countries that are perceived to have heightened levels of public sector corruption increased business in countries perceived to have heightened levels of corruption could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from our business operations we have implemented and continue to update our compliance program but there is a risk that our employees partners and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations could take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible in addition we are subject to global trade laws that apply to our worldwide operations including restrictions on conducting business in certain restricted countries or with certain entities or individuals any violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” the uk bribery act other applicable anticorruption and antibribery laws export control or global trade laws by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries could result in regulatory investigations and whistleblower complaints which could subject us to significant risks such as adverse media coverage andor severe criminal or civil sanctions which could materially adversely affect our reputation business operating results and prospects 

we participate in intensely competitive markets and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be harmed 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for digital workflow products and offerings matures and new technologies inhouse solutions and competitors enter the market we find ourselves increasingly competing with solutions and alternative approaches to solving customer needs or experiencing reluctance or unwillingness from customers to migrate away from their current solutions further as our offerings have become more widely adopted and successful in the market more competitors are developing competing offerings for example while the now platform was designed to quickly integrate with and offers solutions that are complementary to the offerings of many wellestablished systems that traditionally operate as “systems of record” competition in this space has been increasing some of the companies operating these “systems of record” offer or plan to offer workflow solutions similar to ours additionally sources of alternative solutions and approaches include those provided by 

• enterprise application software vendors such as oracle sap salesforce and workday 

• new technology vendors and entrants 

• inhouse solutions of current and prospective customers and 

• cloudbased vendors 

some of our existing competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition and scale longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater financial technical and resources than we do competitors and new entrants may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices they may introduce new technology solve similar problems in different ways or more effectively utilize existing technology that reduces demand for our services they may utilize acquisitions integrations or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages “systems of record” operators may attempt to create technology solutions that would prevent our systems from integrating with theirs enterprise software application vendors may reduce the price of or offer freeofcharge competing products services or subscriptions creating pricing pressures or bundle them with their other offerings causing our offerings to appear relatively more expensive smaller competitors new technology vendors and new entrants may also accelerate pricing pressures in the various markets in which we compete 

additionally companies may expand their services to compete with our services or we may shift our products and services to compete with current and future competitors in adjacent markets they may invest in industryspecific solutions that claim to provide a unique solution for that industry we have expanded and expect to continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets and industries the use of our platform by developers and generally in lowcodenocode capabilities as a result we expect increasing competition from companies focused on these other areas also as 

customers increasingly adopt a hybrid onpremise and offpremise approach for their it workloads our cloud services may fail to address evolving customer requirements which could cause a decline in demand for our services and for us to experience lower growth competition from cloudbased vendors may increase as they partner with onpremise hardware providers to deliver their cloud platform as an onpremise solution further the flexibility of future of work models may reduce entry barriers in the markets we operate or usher a new wave of innovation increasing competition from new entrants and technologies and existing competitors for these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully competition could result in reduced sales and margins losses or failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

if we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases on digital technologies and shift to modern cloudbased infrastructure and agile ways of working as digital transformation accelerates across the enterprise capabilities such as ai machine learning hyper automation lowcodenocode application development system observability database scalability consumergrade user experiences collaboration internetconnected devices security cryptography internal software development operations and application and service awareness become increasingly relevant to customers’ evolving needs our customers and prospective customers are either facing competing imperatives to adopt digital technologies or are built on fully digital modern dynamic it technologies accordingly to compete effectively we must 

• identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies 

• accurately predict our customers’ changing digital transformation needs priorities and adoption practices including their technology infrastructures and buying and budgetary practices 

• invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet the very high performance expectations of our customers 

• successfully deliver new scalable platform and database technologies and products to meet these needs and priorities 

• efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments 

• expand our offerings into industries and to buyers who are not familiar with our offerings 

• profitably market and sell products to companies in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience 

• successfully shift to a subscriptionbased services model and sell such services effectively secure our platform data and customers’ data and 

• effectively deliver directly or through our partner ecosystem the digital transformation process planning it systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful 

if we fail to meet any of these requirements our competitive position strategic relevance and business prospects may be harmed further we may make significant investments in changing the way we offer our products or services such as starting the shift to a subscriptionbased model for support services in response to evolving customer needs customers may be dissatisfied with the change in the manner and scope of how the services are delivered and the resulting change in the pricing model and may resist or be slow to adopt changes to our offerings all of which may adversely impact our ability to compete 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented 36 and 35 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues outside the us the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to different regulatory political and economic risks from those in the us we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers geographic specific service delivery models advisory councils cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing partnership arrangements personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers a factor affecting our growth has been generally lower in territories where we are less established and where there may be increased or changing regulations and operational and ip risks as compared to our more established locations we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including hiring qualified sales management personnel penetrating the target market anticipating and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and developments and managing foreign operations in such locales risks inherent with making our products and services available in international markets include without limitation 

• compliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations including employment tax competition requirements to have local partners local entity ownership limitations technology transfer or sharing requirements data residency and transfer laws and regulations privacy and data protection laws and regulations which may increase operational costs and restrictions 

• compliance by us and our business partners with international bribery and anticorruption laws including but not limited to the uk bribery act and the fcpa 

• the risk that illegal or unethical activities of our local employees or business partners will be attributed to or result in liability to us or damage to our reputation 

• the risk that we will fail to meet the requirements of the rules and regulations relating to government or other public sector contracting 

• longer and potentially more complex sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties 

• tax treatment of revenues from international sources and changes to tax codes including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

• different pricing and distribution environments 

• foreign currency fluctuations which may cause transactional and translational remeasurement losses 

• potential changes in international trade policies tariffs agreements and practices including the adoption and expansion of formal or informal trade restrictions or regulatory frameworks favoring local competitors 

• potential threatening statesponsored actions including cybersecurity threats directed at local data centers customers or endusers 

• local governmental direction business practices andor cultural norms that may favor local competitors 

• localization of our services including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses and 

• natural disasters acts of war terrorism or pandemics 

if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues and if these partners fail to perform our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

an increasing portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners including managed service providers and resellers increasingly we and our customers rely on our partners to provide professional services including customer implementations and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand while we provide our partners with training and programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may require significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our corporate policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or ip ownership could constrain these partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

delays in the release of or actual or perceived defects in our products may slow the adoption of our latest technologies reduce our ability to efficiently provide services decrease customer satisfaction and adversely impact future product sales 

we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products the success of any release depends on a number of factors including our ability to manage the risks associated with actual or perceived quality or other defects or deficiencies delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introducing our products if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are difficult to implement customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted customer satisfaction may decrease our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced and our growth prospects may be harmed 

as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive and we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges 

as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers we may face heightened costs longer sales cycles greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales with such customers their decision to use our services may be an enterprisewide decision such sales require considerable time for the customer to evaluate and test our platform prior to making a purchasing decision require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services as well as addressing concerns regarding data security compliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally in addition larger enterprise customers may demand more configuration integration services and features as a result of these factors these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers 

driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions large enterprise customers may be switching from legacy onpremises solutions when purchasing our products and may rely on third parties with whom we do not have relationships when making purchasing decisions if we fail to effectively manage these risks associated with sales cycles and sales to larger enterprise customers our business financial condition and results of operations may be affected 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional shareholder dilution 

we have acquired or invested in companies and technologies as part of our business strategy and will continue to evaluate and execute potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets we have and will continue to enter relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings gotomarket and sales efforts functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies although we conduct reasonably extensive due diligence with each of the entities we engage for a strategic transaction our efforts may not reveal every material concern with respect to the target entity or our assumptions surrounding the resulting combination these strategic transactions involve numerous risks including 

• assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies 

• failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment 

• potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 

• inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business 

• potential adverse tax consequences 

• disruption to our business and diversion of management attention and other resources 

• potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers 

• dependence on acquired technologies or licenses for which alternatives may not be available to us without significant cost or complexity 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• introducing increased complexity and burden to maintain the technology platform or introducing vulnerabilities or threats by integrating acquired technologies 

• increased data security or privacy compliance requirements from integrating the acquired technology or company 

• impairment to our investments if our investees are unable to obtain future funding on favorable terms or at all and 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses 

in addition we have and may continue to pay cash and may have to incur debt or issue equity or equitylinked securities to pay for acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or our stock price furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing shareholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect our stock price the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to the operation of our business 

if we or our thirdparty service providers experience an actual or perceived cybersecurity event our platform may be perceived as not being secure and we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive data which may include personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and in some cases government information while we have security measures and a data governance framework in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss these measures may contain legacy code vulnerabilities have limited implementation or be breached because of employee error or intentional action or thirdparty actions including unintentional events or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals or foreign state actors and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our instances and ultimately our customers’ data or our data ip and other confidential business information for example third parties have attempted to fraudulently induce employees contractors or users to disclose information or to gain access to our data or our customers’ data and we have been the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets further we have experienced increased cyberattacks and security challenges as the growing number of employees vendors and other third parties that remotely access our systems increases our attack surface we have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume frequency and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces 

computer malware ransomware viruses hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become 

more prevalent in our industry and they or attempts have occurred on our and our thirdparty service providers’ systems in the past and may occur again on these systems in the future the frequency and sophistication of these malicious attacks have increased and it appears that cyber crimes and cyber criminal networks some of which may be statesupported have been provided substantial resources and may target us enterprises or our customers and their use of our products in addition we have established extensive development and testing environments for our engineers developing new products and features security protocols in those environments have necessarily been less rigorous than in environments housing customer data but a vulnerability or security defect developed in that environment could become incorporated in code imported to our environments housing customer data similarly in the unique circumstances where customer data may be utilized in developer environments for testing or learning that data may be at greater risk because techniques used to sabotage obtain unauthorized access to systems or prohibit authorized access to systems change frequently and generally may not be detected until successfully launched against a target we have been and may continue to be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures this has included and may continue to include underlying infiltration of preexisting systems including those of our thirdparty service providers or customers perpetrated by more sophisticated or statesupported attackers including foreign cybersecurity attacks on us technology companies identified in late 2020 it may also include exploitation of vulnerabilities in third party or open source software code that may be incorporated into our own or our customers’ systems such as the vulnerability in the java logging library known as “log4j” identified in late 2021 that affected many in our industry the occurrence of these and other more sophisticated or statesupported attack campaigns may increase as geopolitical tensions and intermittent warfare escalate outside of the us we devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures while meeting customer expectations as to the performance of our systems however as cybersecurity threats develop and grow more complex over time we will continue to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure but a residual risk may remain despite our preventative efforts a security breach suffered by us or our thirdparty service providers an attack against our service availability or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation service level agreement claims indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other significant costs and liabilities in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of paying to access data investigating remediating complying with notice obligations and implementing additional measures designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents we also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 

further in most instances our customers administer access to the data held in their particular instance for their employees and service providers while we offer tools and support customers are not required to utilize them and may suffer a cybersecurity event on their own systems unrelated to our own and allow a malicious actor to obtain access to the customer’s information held on our platform even if such a breach is unrelated to our security programs or practices such breach could result in our incurring significant economic and operational costs in investigating remediating and implementing additional measures to further protect our customers from their own vulnerabilities and could result in reputational harm to us 

digital supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity we cannot guarantee that third parties and our supply chain infrastructure have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our platform systems and network or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our business third parties may also exploit vulnerabilities in or obtain unauthorized access to platforms systems networks or physical facilities utilized by us or our thirdparty vendors or service providers 

if we lose key members of our management team or employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our compensation costs will increase and our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

competition for talent in the technology industry has become increasingly intense particularly in the last several months in 2021 there has been a dramatic increase in workers leaving their positions throughout our industry that is being referred to as the “great resignation” and the market to build retain and replace talent has become even more highly competitive our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our management team particularly our chief executive officer our chief product and engineering officer and the other members of our executive staff in response to this highly competitive environment we recently made significant performancebased equity awards to our executive staff outside of our regular compensation program but we cannot guarantee that this will be sufficient to retain all of these individuals from time to time in the ordinary course of business there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives while we seek to manage these transitions carefully including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge cause disruptions to our business and negatively affect our business 

the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for diverse talented product and engineering sales and operations employees many key individual contributors particularly in research and development engineering and sales are critical to our success and can command very significant compensation in the market we have faced and may continue to face difficulties attracting hiring and retaining highlyskilled personnel and with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all in particular competition for experienced software 

and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in our primary operating locations san francisco bay area san diego seattle hyderabad dublin london and amsterdam is intense such difficulties may be exacerbated by employees’ reactions to our policies related to covid19 vaccination or flexibility to remote working as a result we have also experienced and may continue to experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales potentially resulting in a reduction in our profitability many of our employees including all of our executive officers are employed “atwill” and may terminate their employment with us at any time if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

in addition we believe our corporate culture of fostering innovation teamwork and employee satisfaction has been a key contributor to our success to date however in this period of the great resignation we have and may continue to face higher employee turnover rates as we continue to grow and expand globally and navigate shifting workforce priorities including a new hybrid work model in which many of our employees continue to work remote for part of the week and fully remote workers continue to increase we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success and could ultimately have a negative impact on our ability to innovate our technology and our business further as of december 31 2021 approximately 31 of our employees have been employed by us for a year or less and we must be able to effectively integrate develop and motivate a large number of new employees while maintaining the effectiveness of our business execution and the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such challenges may be exacerbated by the new hybrid work model 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

our business depends on our platform to be available without disruption from time to time we experience defects disruptions outages and other performance and quality problems with our platform and new defects may be detected in the future and may arise from our increasing use of the public cloud for example we provide regular updates to our services which can contain undetected defects when first released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including opensource software disruptions may result from errors we make in developing delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service or ransomware attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data centers operated by several different providers located around the world and serve certain of our customers that are primarily in highly regulated markets using data center facilities operated by public cloud service providers these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence despite precautions taken at these centers problems at these centers have occurred resulting in interruptions in our services such problems could occur again and result in similar or lengthier service interruptions and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers in addition to data center providers we also have a large ecosystem of service providers that we use in our delivery of our products if there is a compromise to data or other incident with our critical service providers it may impact our ability to provide our services our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers similarly customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency and performance depending on their business models and customers in highly regulated markets may have more demanding requirements that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet the occurrence of payment delays service credit warranty or termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles an increase to our service level credit accruals other increased expenses or risks of litigation we may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions to our services 

lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other ip development activity and claims and related litigation regarding patent and ip rights in our industry our competitors other third parties and nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of infringement misappropriation or other violations of ip rights against us moreover the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses we have recorded material charges for legal settlements of such claims in the past in any ip litigation regardless of the scope or merit we may incur substantial costs and attorney’s fees and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon misappropriating or otherwise violating the ip rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages andor make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease 

offering or modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners obtain costly licenses on their behalf andor refund fees or other payments previously paid to us further upon expiration of the term of any agreements that allow us to use thirdparty ip we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all in which case we may face ip litigation the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers this could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors and cause a substantial decline in our stock price any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under patent copyright trademark trade secret and other ip protections in the us and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents acquired in the future may not provide competitive advantages or other value in addition any patents that have been or may be issued or acquired may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them further legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of ip rights vary 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality similar to ours policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our ip rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from utilizing their developments to compete with us reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our ip rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer services the laws of some foreign countries may not offer effective protection for or be as protective of ip rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of ip rights or available remedies may be inadequate ineffective or scarce we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights we have initiated and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement or misappropriation of ip rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our ip rights or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our ip rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into our products and services in the future we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products and services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services for example depending on which open source license governs certain open source software included within our products and services we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our products and services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using such open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from distributing our products and services 

various factors including our customers’ business integration migration compliance and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers may cause implementations of our products to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful 

our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers either through us or our partners further our customers’ business integration migration compliance and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers or other factors may cause implementations to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful for example changes in the functional requirements of our customers delays in timeline or deviations from recommended best practices may occur during the course of implementation as a result of these and other risks we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase implementation and enablement of our products some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers’ expectations which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented some customers may lack the internal resources to manage a digital transformation such as our offering and as a consequence may be unable to see the benefits of our products unsuccessful lengthy or costly implementations and integrations could result in claims from customers reputational harm and opportunities for competitors to displace our products each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

risks related to the financial performance or financial position of our business 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors some of which are beyond our control for any period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or our investors there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our financial performance to vary widely or cause our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include 

• our ability to attract new customers retain and increase sales to existing customers and satisfy customers’ requirements 

• changes in our mix of products and services including cloud and selfhosted offerings or customers use of our products 

• our ability to increase sales and market penetration of our products or services 

• volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and our ability to effectively hedge our foreign currency exposure 

• the rate of expansion retention and productivity of our sales and engineering organizations 

• the number of new employees added 

• the cost timing and management effort for our development of new products and services 

• general economic conditions that may adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to business operation and expansion 

• seasonality of when we enter into customer agreements 

• the length and complexity of the sales cycle and certification process for our services especially for larger deals and sales to larger enterprises government and regulated organizations 

• changes in the size and complexity of our customer relationships 

• changes to our management sales and account management teams as we scale and evolve business priorities 

• changes in our or our competitors’ pricing policies or models 

• significant security breaches technical difficulties or interruptions of our services 

• new solutions or products introduced by our competitors 

• changes in effective tax rates 

• changes in the average contract term of our customer agreements timing of renewals renewal rates expansion within our existing customers and billings duration 

• the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers 

• extraordinary expenses such as litigation costs or damages including settlement payments 

• the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the followon costs of integration including the tax effects of acquisitions 

• changes in laws or regulations impacting the delivery of our services 

• our ability to comply with privacy laws and regulations 

• significant litigation or regulatory actions relating to claims of ip infringement violation of privacy laws employment matters or any other significant matter 

• the amount and timing of equity awards and the related financial statement expenses 

• the impact of new accounting pronouncements and 

• our ability to accurately estimate the total addressable market for our products and services 

because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions net new annual contract value from new subscriptions and expansion contracts entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenues for the duration of the subscription term as a result a significant portion of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods consequently a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period also our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited 

further a decline in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that period but they will negatively affect our revenues in future periods accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally due to the complexity of certain customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under accounting standard codification topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers “topic 606”” depends on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period 

a decrease in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a reporting period may not immediately impact billings for that period because the decrease may be offset by an increase in billings duration the dollar value of contracts with future start dates or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

as our business grows we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our longerterm revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future due to a number of reasons which may include maturation of our business increasing competition or decrease in the growth of our overall market we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities which may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business you should not rely on our revenue from any prior period as an indication of our future revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our stock price could be volatile 

changes in our effective tax rate or disallowance of our tax positions may adversely affect our financial position and results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings the biden administration has proposed increases to the us corporate income tax rate minimum tax on book income and increased taxation of international business operations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law which could affect our results of operations in the period issued many countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or 

more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period further many of our most important intangible assets are held outside the us and are subject to intercompany agreements regarding the development and distribution of those assets to other jurisdictions with potential challenge under permanent establishment or transfer pricing principles while we believe that our position is appropriate and well founded if our position was to be successfully challenged by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions we may become subject to significant tax liabilities which could harm our financial position and financial results 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and at a reasonable assurance level of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse if it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency 

risks related to general economic conditions 

the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and future results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant impact around the world and it is difficult to assess or predict its continued impact on the global economic market which will be highly dependent upon the continuing actions of governments businesses and other organizations in response to the pandemic and the effectiveness of those actions the status of global economic recovery remains uncertain and unpredictable and will be impacted by developments in the pandemic including any subsequent waves of outbreak or new variant strains of the covid19 virus which may require reclosures or other preventative measures if the pandemic were to endure for the longer term recession depression or other sustained adverse market events may result 

early in the covid19 pandemic some customers or potential customers reduced their digital transformation spend or delayed their digital transformation initiatives we also experienced some curtailed customer demand reduced contract duration changes in collection cycles lengthened payment terms and impact on our ability to land new customers if we should see customers reduce or delay their digital transformation spend in response to the pandemic conditions or see increased competitive pressures due to changes in terms and conditions and pricing of our competitors’ products and services our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods could be materially and adversely impacted 

in the first quarter of 2020 we temporarily closed most of our offices including our headquarters around the world starting late 2021 many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week our return to work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols and may change at any time certain employees who do not agree with our approach to health protocols may seek employment elsewhere additionally our efforts to reopen our offices could expose our employees to health risks and could involve additional costs or liability the covid19 pandemic will have a longterm effect on the nature of our office environment remote working and how we innovate and operate while we believe that this will be a positive development over the longer term there may be operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business including talent retention in the shorter term 

if the covid19 pandemic continues or worsens especially in regions in which we have material operations or sales our business activities from impacted areas including salesrelated activities could be adversely affected disruptive activities could include continued business closures in impacted areas further or continued restrictions on our employees’ and other service providers’ ability to travel impacts to productivity if our employees or their family members experience health issues and potential delays in hiring and onboarding mainly in our general and administrative functions the covid19 pandemic could also impact our data center operations including potential disruptions to the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems and primary vendors we rely on for products and services that allow our employees to work remotely 

the extent and continued impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and new variant strains of the virus the availability and distribution of effective vaccines the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing nature and sustainability of economic recovery and government responses including vaccination or testing mandates all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable while our revenues and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods and could cause our future results of operations to vary significantly from period to period 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic also may heighten other risks including significant volatility in the global markets trading prices of our common stock interest rate and foreign currency described in this “risk factors” section risks caused or heightened by the covid19 pandemic may continue for the duration of and possibly beyond the covid19 pandemic for an indefinite period 

natural disasters including climate change and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics such as covid19 terrorism political unrest telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattacks geopolitical instability war the effects of climate change and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain the majority of our research and development activities offices it systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

in addition the impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving we may be subject to increased regulations reporting requirements standards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are focused on mitigating their own climaterelated risks there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our california headquarters have experienced and may continue to experience climaterelated events and at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with the wildfires additionally while more employees have returned to our offices under our new hybrid returntowork model it will remain difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on all our employees as remote work is part of such model changing market dynamics global policy developments and increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our customers or thirdparty suppliers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business revenues and profitability are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions the success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions including among others inflation rate fluctuations interest rates tax rates economic uncertainty political instability changes in laws and trade barriers and sanctions in 2020 the us capital markets experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of covid19 recently inflation rates in the us have increased to levels not seen in several years such economic volatility could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and future market disruptions could negatively impact us these unfavorable economic conditions could increase our operating costs and because our typical contracts with customers lock in our price for a few years our profitability could be negatively affected geopolitical destabilization could impact global currency exchange rates commodity prices trade and movement of resources which may adversely affect the buying power of our customers our access to and cost of resources from our suppliers and ability to grow our business in addition from time to time the us and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical and economic instability high levels of credit defaults international trade disputes changes in demand for various goods and services high levels of persistent unemployment wage and income stagnation restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets inflation bankruptcies international trade agreements trade restrictions and overall economic uncertainty these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of it spending and could adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to political and economic uncertainty globally 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements further unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions moreover for a number of reasons we may not be able to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and could expose us to a greater overall risk of loss than if we had not hedged 

risks related to our 2030 notes and 2022 notes 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2021 we have 15 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2030 notes payable outstanding due on september 1 2030 as described in note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our ability to make payments on repay or refinance the 2030 notes in the future will depend on our future performance which is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control if we decide to refinance the 2030 notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the 2030 notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

• impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and 

• due to limitations within the debt instruments restrict our ability to grant liens on property enter into certain mergers dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole materially change our business or incur subsidiary indebtedness subject to customary exceptions 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in the indentures governing the 2030 notes our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities downgrades in our credit ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding february 1 2022 the holders of the 2022 notes had the option to convert their notes during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 17518 we have settled conversion requests and will settle additional conversion requests prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes we will settle all remaining conversion and maturity settlement obligations in cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the 2022 notes we entered into convertible note hedge the “2022 note hedge” transactions with certain financial institutions “option counterparties” we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock the “2022 warrants” the actual number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the automatic exercise of the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants if any is unknown at this time refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes or following any repurchase of the 2022 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indenture or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in our stock price or the 2022 notes price and to the extent the activity occurs during the final observation period related to the settlement of the remaining 2022 notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on our stock price or the 2022 notes price will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 notes and the resulting amount of cash andor number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 note hedge 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the stock price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in addition technology companies in general have highly volatile stock prices and the volatility in stock price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting our stock price some of which are beyond our control include 

• changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to cover our common stock 

• announcements of new products services or technologies new applications or enhancements to services strategic alliances acquisitions or other significant events by us or by our competitors 

• fluctuations in company valuations such as highgrowth or cloud companies investors perceive to be comparable to us 

• changes to our management team 

• trading activity by directors executive officers and significant shareholders or the market’s perception that large shareholders intend to sell their shares 

• the inclusion exclusion or deletion of our stock from any trading indices such as the sp 500 index 

• the size of our market float 

• the trading volume of our common stock including sales upon exercise of outstanding options or vesting of equity awards or sales and purchases of common stock issued in connection with settling the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants 

• the economy as a whole market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers 

• changes to our credit ratings 

• environmental social governance and other issues impacting our reputation and 

• overall performance of the equity markets 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business this could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in our stock price 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangements return to shareholders will be limited to increased stock price if any 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law 2030 notes or 2022 notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and therefore depress our stock price 

our restated certificate of incorporation as amended “charter” and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress our stock price by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control or changes in our management that the shareholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

• established a classified board although our board will be fully declassified by our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders 

• permit the board to establish the number of directors 

• provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of 66 23 of our shareholders 

• require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our charter and restated bylaws 

• authorize issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a shareholder rights plan 

• prohibit shareholder action by written consent which requires all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting 

• provide that the board is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our restated bylaws and 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at annual shareholder meetings though our restated bylaws have shareholder proxy access 

further section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and certain shareholders the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 notes or change in control repurchase event provisions of our 2030 notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or change in control repurchase event

overview 

  

servicenow was founded on a simple premise a better technology platform will help work flow better the company’s purpose is to make the world work better for everyone we help global enterprises across industries universities and governments to digitize their workflows the now platform enables us to connect systems silos departments and processes with digital workflows that are simple and easy to use we categorize the workflows we provide into four primary areas it employee customer and creator the products under each of our workflows are helping customers connect work across systems and silos to enable great experiences for people the now platform is uniquely positioned to enable our customers’ digital transformation from nonintegrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities the transformation to digital operations enabled by the now platform increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity helping our employees customers and communities and preparing for the future and the longterm success of our business we are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the covid19 pandemic across our business the extent and continued impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and new variant strains of the virus the availability and distribution of effective vaccines the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing nature and sustainability of economic recovery and government responses including vaccination or testing mandates all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable starting late 2021 many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week our return to work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols and may change at any time depending on the severity of or spikes in covid19 the impact if any of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations including financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures see the section “risk factors” in part 1 item 1a of this annual report for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business  

key business metrics 

remaining performance obligations transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations “rpo” represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes deferred revenue and noncancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods rpo excludes contracts that are billed in arrears such as certain time and materials contracts as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance current remaining performance obligations “crpo” represents rpo that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2021 our rpo was 115 billion of which 49 represented crpo rpo and crpo increased by 29 respectively compared to december 31 2020 factors that may cause our rpo to vary from period to period include the following 

• foreign currency exchange rates  while a majority of our contracts have historically been in us dollars an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies particularly the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our rpo 

• mix of offerings  in a minority of cases we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a thirdparty service provider in selfhosted offerings we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result such revenue is excluded from rpo 

  

• subscription start date  from time to time we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in rpo if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date 

  

• timing of contract renewals  while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date for example in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date in other cases prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired 

  

• contract duration  while we typically enter into multiyear subscription services the duration of our contracts varies further we continue to see an increase in the number of 12month agreements entered into with the us federal government throughout the year with the highest number of agreements entered into in the quarter ended september 30 driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures we sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12month or shorter term to enable the contracts to coterminate with the existing contract the contract duration will cause variability in our rpo 

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annual contract value “acv” greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 1359 1085 and 882 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate “gult” data universal numbering system “duns” number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity accordingly we restate previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million calculations to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we believe information regarding the total number of customers with acv greater than 1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the now platform 

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies a calculation of free cash flow is provided below 



1 free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 include the effect of 15 million and 82 million respectively relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts which is significantly higher in the quarter ended december 31 additionally we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended march 31 and september 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans purchases under our employee stock purchase plan payouts under our bonus plans and coupon payments related to our 2030 notes beginning in 2021 

renewal rate we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period divided by the sum of i the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and ii the total acv from all customers lost during the period accordingly our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed further our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewal a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal additionally starting in 2020 we simplified our methodology related to contracts less than 12 months to derive acv used to calculate renewal rate previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments or methodology simplification to allow for comparability however there were no material changes to such previously disclosed renewal rates our renewal rate was 98 for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful 

billings we define billings a nongaap financial measure as gaap revenues recognized plus the change in total gaap unbilled receivables deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the calculation of billings is provided below 



1 as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers renewal contracts expansion contracts contracts with new customers and contracts for professional services and training factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following 

• billings duration  while we typically bill customers annually in advance for our subscription services customers sometimes request and we accommodate billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12month term changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of 38 million and an immaterial impact on billings for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

• contract start date  from time to time we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date 

• foreign currency exchange rates  while a majority of our billings have historically been in us dollars an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies particularly the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will cause variability in our billings foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of 74 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

• timing of contract renewals while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date for example in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date in other cases prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired 

• seasonality  we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as expansion with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year the increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures and the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by december 31 furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloudoffering contracts with a future start date from our billings unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance further the seasonal factors could be heightened due to the impact of a gross domestic product contraction and other impacts unknown on our customers and sales cycles caused by the covid19 pandemic 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings results we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented notwithstanding the adjustments described above the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals for which no adjustments have been presented 

while we believe billings is one indicator of the performance of our business due to the factors described above an increase or decrease in billings may not reflect the actual performance for that reporting period as a result our billings metric has become less indicative of the actual performance of our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term for our cloud services we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally noncancelable and without any refundtype provisions 

subscription revenues also include revenues from selfhosted offerings in which customers deploy or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software for these contracts we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price “ssp” basis the transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term 

we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations for these contracts the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment 

deferred commissions 

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third parties commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years consistent with prior year commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term additionally for selfhosted offerings consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for selfhosted offerings a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the selfhosted offering is made available determining the period of benefit including average renewal term requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts our technology life cycle and other factors 

  

business combinations 

the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows discount rates the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions as new information is obtained and may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed but not later than one year from the acquisition date 

income taxes 

  

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense benefit and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

due to cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation and based on all available positive and negative evidence we have determined that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31 2021 management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future in determining the need or continued need for a valuation allowance we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes among other things cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation expense  future growth forecasted earnings and future taxable income 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

change in accounting estimate 

in january 2022 we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2022 based on the carrying amount of data center equipment included in property and equipment net that are inservice as of december 31 2021 it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2022 operating income by approximately 80 million 

new accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

the impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

components of results of operations 

  

revenues 

subscription revenues  subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both selfhosted offerings and cloudbased subscription offerings and related standard and enhanced support and updates if any to the subscription service during the subscription term for our cloudbased offerings we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term for selfhosted offerings a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin pricing includes multiple instances hosting and support services data backup and disaster recovery services as well as future updates when and if available offered during the subscription term we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal our contracts are generally noncancelable during the subscription term though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform 

professional services and other revenues  our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered onsite or through publicly available classes typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization we also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners we also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel through both our direct team and indirect channel sales revenues from our direct sales organization represented 79 81 and 82 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively for purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff including salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits in addition sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses marketing program expenses which include events such as knowledge and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated expenses directly associated with our research and development staff including salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation and allocated overhead research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes

comparison of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

revenues 



subscription revenues increased by 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count included in subscription revenues is 241 million and 205 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we expect subscription revenues for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 we will continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic in 2022 and its impact on customer acquisition and renewal rates 

our expectations for revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31 2022 are based on the 31day average of foreign exchange rates for december 2021 

subscription revenues consist of the following 



our digital workflow products include the now platform it service management it business management it asset management security operations governance risk and compliance hr service delivery safe workplace suite of applications workplace service delivery legal service delivery customer service management field service management industry solutions app engine and integrationhub and are generally priced on a per user basis our itom products are generally priced on a per node physical or virtual server basis and increasingly on a subscription unit basis which allows us to measure customers’ management of physical it resources  

professional services and other revenues increased by 90 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year due to an increase in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers we expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 



cost of subscription revenues increased by 291 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount and increased costs to support the growth of our subscription offerings including costs to support customers in regulated markets personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses increased by 123 million as compared to prior year depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity including public cloud service costs increased by 141 million and amortization of intangibles increased by 29 million as a result of acquisitions as compared to the prior year 

we expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances but slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue resulting from the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022 

our subscription gross profit percentage was 82 and 83 for each of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect our subscription gross profit percentage to slightly increase for the year ended december 31 2022 compared to the year ended december 31 2021 driven by the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022 however we will continue to incur incremental costs to attract customers in regulated markets by adopting public cloud offerings as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased by 75 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support growth resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses by 55 million and an increase in outside service costs by 20 million compared to prior period 

our professional services and other gross loss percentage improved to 2 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 10 in the prior year primarily driven by the increased utilization of our internal professional services organization and the reduction in certain travel expenses however we expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to worsen for the year ending december 31 2022 as we expect additional cost to support business growth and increases in travel expenses compared to the year ended december 31 2021 

sales and marketing 



sales and marketing expenses increased by 437 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 329 million compared to the prior year amortization of deferred commissions and thirdparty referral fees increased by 79 million compared to the prior year due to an increase in contracts with new customers expansion and renewal contracts other sales and marketing program expenses which include branding purchase of advertising and market data and outside services increased by 29 million compared to the prior year we converted certain inperson events to digital events in the first half of 2021 amid covid19 travel restrictions which resulted in certain savings for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year 

we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 as we continue to see leverage from increased sales productivity and marketing efficiencies offset by growth in our international operations and increases in travel expenses in 2022 

research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 373 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 346 million compared to prior year the remaining increase was primarily due to 22 million increase in outside services and hosting costs and data center related depreciation costs to support research and development activities  

we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses increased by 143 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 113 million the remaining increase was primarily due to 21 million of outside service costs to support digital transformation projects across functions to improve processes as we scale as well as incremental investment in environmental social and corporate governance initiatives “esg” 

we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december 31 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 as we continue to see leverage from continued ga productivity offset by higher stockbased compensation related to the 2021 performance awards increased investment in cyber security and our esg efforts 

stockbased compensation 



stockbased compensation increased by 261 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards 

stockbased compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2021 we expect stockbased compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december 31 2022 as we continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2021 we expect stockbased compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 36 and 35 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound sterling during the year ended december 31 2021 had a favorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported subscription revenues would have been 77 million lower the impact from the foreign currency movements was not material for professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 

in addition because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense during the year ended december 31 2021 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses would have been 22 million and 25 million lower for the year ended december 31 2021 respectively the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2021 was not material to research and development and general and administrative expenses 

interest expense 



interest expense decreased during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs as a result of lower outstanding principal balance of the 2022 notes for the year ending december 31 2022 we expect to incur approximately 25 million related to the 2030 notes and 2022 notes 

other income expense net 



other income expense net increased by 36 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the lower loss on extinguishment of the 2022 notes due primarily to the 2022 notes repurchase which occurred in 2020 and a larger amount of early conversions of the 2022 notes and lower foreign currency exchange losses mainly offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from the decline in interest rates 

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes 



  

our effective tax rate was 8 and 21 for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the difference in rates was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in foreign jurisdictions with differing tax rates including a revaluation of our deferred taxes to account for a change in the united kingdom tax rate and a partial valuation allowance release related to acquired lightstep inc deferred tax liabilities see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for benefit from income taxes 

we maintained a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services and cash outflows to develop new services and core technologies that further enhance the now platform engage our customer and enhance their experience and enable and transform our business operations subscription services arrangements typically have a threeyear duration and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98 over the last three years cash outflows from operations are principally comprised of the salaries bonuses commissions and benefits for our workforce licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and data centers and operating lease arrangements that underlie our facilities we have generated positive operating cash flows over the last ten years as we continue to grow our business in pursuit of our business strategy and we expect to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations during 2022 when assessing sources of liquidity we also include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaling 49 billion as of december 31 2021 

our working capital requirements are principally comprised of noncontract workforce salaries bonuses commissions and benefits and to a lesser extent cancellable and noncancelable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and operating lease obligations noncancelable purchase commitments for business operations total 383 million as of december 31 2021 due primarily over the next five years in addition we expect payment for the investment in celonis se of 100 million in the first quarter of 2022 operating lease obligations totaling 741 million are principally associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with 418 million due over the next five years 

to grow our business we also invest in capital and expand our facilities to enable our data centers and workforce and consider strategic acquisitions of technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio our capital expenditures are typically under cancelable arrangements primarily used to support the installed base and growth of our hosted business we have also issued longterm debt to finance our business  in august 2020 we issued 140 fixed rate tenyear notes with an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion due on september 1 2030 the “2030 notes” in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million the remaining principal amount of the 2022 notes totaling 92 million will be settled in cash during the first half of 2022 

our free cash flows together with our other sources of liquidity are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and noncancellable arrangements we anticipate cash flows generated from operations cash cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months as we look beyond the next 12 months we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business if we require additional capital resources we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 18 billion for the prior year the net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to increase in operating income and higher collections driven by revenue growth compared to settlement of payables in addition we benefited from a reduction in repayments of 2022 notes attributable to debt discount 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 16 billion compared to 15 billion for the prior year the net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 678 million increase in business combinations net of cash and restricted cash acquired and 59 million purchase of new strategic investments offset by 586 million decrease in net purchases of investments 

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 506 million compared to net provided by financing activities of 597 million for the prior year the change was primarily driven by the 15 billion proceeds from the issuance of 2030 notes in the year ended december 31 2020 offset by the 2022 notes repurchase of 16 billion which was funded in part by the proceeds received from the partial unwind of the 2022 note hedge of 11 billion the remaining change was due to 103 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by 21 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans primarily driven by higher share price compared to prior year 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our estimated future obligations consist of leases an agreement to purchase 100 million of common and preferred shares in celonis se purchase obligations debt and unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2021 refer to note 17 “commitments and contingencies” and note 19 “subsequent events” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 




 



foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and british pound sterling and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar relative to these currencies and conversely are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these currencies revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 70 during the year ended december 31 2021 and 71 for each of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

  

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded 

a hypothetical 10 increase in the us dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 62 million 47 million and 31 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

these derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty while the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes refer to note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 49 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments as of december 31 2021 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds certificates of deposit corporate notes and bonds government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poor’s baa2 by moody’s or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 30 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2020 we had an aggregate of 46 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 29 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in august 2020 we issued 140 fixed rate tenyear notes with an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion due on september 1 2030 the 2030 notes were issued at 9963 of principal and we incurred approximately 13 million for debt issuance costs interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on march 1 2021 and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on september 1 2030 the 2030 notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 notes contain customary events of default and covenants that among others and subject to exceptions restrict the company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to specified properties 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because these instruments do not bear interest we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 notes associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of our 2022 notes is exposed to interest rate risks generally the fair market value of our 2022 notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of the 2022 notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature and will generally increase as the stock price increases 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 99 million and 28 million respectively of equity investments in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value we are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a result we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income in future periods as we continue to strategically invest and grow the portfolio due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities these changes could be material based on market conditions and events

 item 1 business tableend

servicenow’s purpose is to make the world of work work better for people we believe that people want the technology they use in their work to be more efficient and easier to use we build applications to meet that demand by automating existing processes and creating efficient digitized workflows with a consumer grade user experience our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments systems and processes of a business when work flows naturally great experiences follow 

getting a job done in an enterprise what we call a “workflow” usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together often they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving along to the next we believe that this approach is undergoing a transformation enterprises have to operate in new and faster ways and need digital processes and systems that can quickly pivot and adapt to rapidly changing business needs we believe that the most effective digital transformation initiatives utilize tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems departments processes and people we also believe that many business challenges whether it be the need for a streaming service to quickly and efficiently initiate and support new customer accounts or the need for state governments to efficiently manage the distribution of unemployment insurance payments can be broken down into discrete tasks and those tasks can be managed digitally until the job or the workflow is complete 

servicenow delivers digital workflows on a single enterprise cloud platform called the now platform® our product portfolio is currently focused on providing information technology “it” employee and customer workflows in standardized product offerings we also enable our customers to design and build their own custom workflow applications using our creator workflows formerly called the now platform app engine and to integrate those applications with third party systems through our integration hub 

the now platform is the foundation of our it employee customer and creator workflow offerings we call it the platform of platforms because it connects people functions and systems to drive innovation increase business agility and unlock productivity because the now platform is built on a single technology platform our own developers and developers working for our customers can innovate quickly and deploy solutions rapidly our increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning also allows for the creation of many workflows to quickly become fully automated our native mobile applications greatly assist in delivering those automated workflows to our customers’ employees 

while the importance of digital transformation has been increasing in recent years the covid19 pandemic accelerated that need and underscored the critical importance of digital and automated workflows as the world economy underwent increasing disruption companies further along in their digital transformation were better able to maintain business continuity and improve productivity when employees could no longer access their physical workspaces because of public health safety concerns enterprises needed processes and systems that could communicate with one another without manual steps or intervention the now platform became a critical tool to help many of our customers meet that need the agility of the platform and the speed with which developers could create and automate solutions accelerated their digital transformation which better equipped our customers for the future of work 

our standardized workflows helped our customers adapt and manage a remote workforce in a matter of weeks not months and our customers created their own solutions on the now platform in a matter of days and weeks not months and years our own engineers were able to develop workforce management solutions in a matter of weeks and update them on a regular cadence when the pandemic first led to employers restricting their physical locations we quickly developed applications to allow employers to communicate with employees and manage potential exposures to the virus and over the course of the next months we developed applications to allow employers to manage their employees’ return to the workplace and maximize their safety in physical facilities as vaccines were developed and are being distributed we developed applications to help governments allow their citizens to access critical vaccine information schedule appointments and receive appointment notifications from vaccine providers our customers from national state and local governments to large private enterprises have built their own custom solutions utilizing the creator workflow offering these are just some examples of how our customers leverage the now platform to optimize their investments in digital transformation and create a better experience for their employees and customers

competition 

  

we compete in markets that are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as these markets continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

• large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors and large integrated systems vendors 

• new entrants to the market developing technologies to solve similar problems in different ways 

• solutions developed inhouse by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools 

• vendors of infrastructureasaservice platformasaservice providers and development operations and 

• established and emerging cloud vendors 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to ours accordingly we compete with both cloudbased and traditional enterpriseapplication software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer as we continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets and verticals we expect increasing competition from platform and application development vendors focused on these markets and verticals 

various factors influence purchase decisions in our industry including total cost of ownership customer experience level of customer satisfaction breadth and depth of product functionality security adherence to industry standards brand awareness flexibility performance relevance and traction we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices an existing competitor or potential competitor could introduce new technology or more effectively utilize existing technology that reduces demand for our services acquisitions integrations and consolidation by and among other companies in our industry may allow potential competitors to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages which may impact our competitive position in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures larger competitors may also have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other offerings which may enable them to offer their products and services at a lower price as competition intensifies we expect pricing competition to continue or increase 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of us and international copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property “ip” rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services in certain of our partnership arrangements our partners may develop technology on the now platform that may be subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights that we agree to with the partner 

we continue to grow our global patent portfolio and ip rights that relate to our platform applications services research and development and other activities our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip we have over 950 us and foreign patents including patents acquired from third parties and over 750 pen ding patent applications we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other ip right or group of related patents or ip rights we file patent applications to protect our ip and have and may continue to acquire additional patents patent portfolios or patent applications however we cannot be certain that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of value or applicability in addition any patents that have been or may be issued or acquired may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality similar to ours policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we operate may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our ip rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from utilizing their developments to compete with us reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other ip rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other ip rights against us our channel partners or our customers in addition based on our greater visibility expanding solutions footprint and market exposure as a public company we face a higher risk of being the subject of ip infringement claims see “risk factors—lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results” for additional information 

human capital management 

  

we have over 13000 employees worldwide and strive to ensure that our employees understand embrace and deliver on our purpose to make the world of work work better for people we believe that our employees commitment to our purpose contributes to higher employee satisfaction productivity and results in the creation of more customerfocused products and services this year much of our human capital management efforts focused on diversity inclusion and belonging and ensuring a proper and effective response to the covid19 pandemic for our employees 

as of december 31 2020 we had 13096 fulltime employees worldwide none of our us employees are represented by a labor union employees in certain european countries are represented by workers’ councils and have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements 

purpose culture and employee engagement 

as a company we undertake numerous efforts to ensure that our employees understand embrace and deliver on our purpose to make the world of work work better for people from a recruiting process in which we evaluate candidates in part based on their commitment to our purpose to an onboarding process that includes content on purpose and how our products impact our customers to regular companywide meetings in which our purpose is a central theme to department and individual discussions of purpose we seek to provide education in a variety of formats we regularly measure our employees’ engagement to determine whether they see their work contributing to the company’s larger purpose including through an employee voice survey 

our culture is driven by our core company values 

• win as a team 

• embrace diversity create belonging 

• enjoy the journey 

• deliver customer success 

• innovate and execute 

• stay hungry and humble 

we screen leadership hires and measure employee performance against these company values and regularly measure employee engagement against these values through our employee voice survey we believe our valuesdriven culture of open and transparent communication has contributed to our recognition as a great place to work by our employees 

diversity inclusion and belonging – commitment to equality of opportunity pay equity and employee wellbeing 

embracing diversity inclusion and belonging is a business imperative that is core to how we operate recruit talent develop our people create culture and innovate diverse inclusive teams where everyone feels they belong are high performing teams that are more innovative productive and engaged we have believed in this principle and invested resources in this area for some time but the need for investment in diversity was more widely recognized in the technology industry in 2020 in past years we have evaluated pay equity practices for our workforce and we plan to do so on an ongoing basis to ensure employees at the same job title and level are paid consistently 

we have regularly measured our representation of women in the company including in leadership and technical positions as of december 2019 in the us where we have pay data by gender race and ethnicity women and underrepresented groups earn 100 and 101 for every 100 earned by their male and white counterparts respectively as of december 2019 globally where we have pay data by gender women earn 099 for every 100 earned by their male counterparts we have published our gender representation and pay equity data in an annual diversity report which we have posted on our publicfacing website 

we are committed to employee wellbeing and offer mental and behavioral health support to our employees including therapy and educational resources 

human capital management in response to covid19 

in responding to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 we prioritized ensuring the safety and health of our employees before health guidance suggested shelter in place initiatives we began to limit business travel and encourage remote working then in advance of shelter in place requirements we adopted a company policy encouraging all employees to work from home and closed most of our offices including our headquarters except for certain critical positions in april 2020 we committed to protect the jobs of our global workforce through 2020 with a “no layoff” pledge despite the economic uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic we met that commitment and did not conduct any layoffs in 2020 in addition to meeting our commitment to the no layoff pledge we had a net increase to our total headcount of approximately 26 since transitioning to a mostly work from home environment we launched regular employee surveys to check in on employee wellbeing and sentiment on return to workplace readiness recognizing the impact of covid19 on our employees’ mental health we also offered additional wellness and behavioral health education and resources to our employees we also continued to invest in the future of our workforce by hosting our summer intern program globally with more than 360 interns participating digitally

 item 1a risk factors tableend

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks our stock price could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the resulting global economic uncertainty and measures taken in response will continue to impact our business and future results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

beginning in early 2020 the covid19 pandemic began to have widespread impact on the health of the population and a broader impact on the markets the covid19 pandemic disrupted the flow of the economy and put unprecedented strains on governments health care systems educational institutions businesses and individuals around the world the pandemic had a significant impact in 2020 and its ongoing impact into 2021 and beyond is difficult to assess or predict it is even more difficult to predict the impact on the global economic market which will be highly dependent upon the continuing actions of governments businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic and the effectiveness of those actions if the pandemic were to endure for the longer term recession depression or other sustained adverse market events may result 

some customers or potential customers particularly in industries most impacted by the covid19 pandemic including transportation hospitality retail and energy reduced their it spending or delayed their digital transformation initiatives in 2020 and these reductions and delays in spend by our customers and prospects could persist we experienced some curtailed customer demand reduced customer spend or contract duration delayed collections lengthened payment terms and impact on our ability to land new customers if we should see an increase in such effects or increased competitive pressures due to changes in terms and conditions and pricing of our competitors’ products and services our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods could be materially and adversely impacted 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed most of our offices including our headquarters around the world encouraged our employees to work remotely implemented travel restrictions for all nonessential business and canceled or shifted certain of our customer industry analyst investor and employee events to virtualonly experiences for the immediate future we have deemed it advisable to continue to do so though our approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols additionally our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful could expose our employees to health risks and could involve additional costs or liability we expect that the covid19 pandemic will have a longterm effect on the nature of our office environment remote working and how we innovate while we believe that this will be a positive development over the longer term there may be operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business including talent retention in the shorter term 

as a result of the impact of covid19 on our business in our q1 2020 earnings we revised our external guidance to investors as to our expectations of our financial performance for the full year 2020 to account for impacts that have occurred and further expected impacts because we are a subscription business the reduction in performance for 2020 will impact future years as well if the covid19 pandemic continues or worsens especially in regions in which we have material operations or sales our business activities from impacted areas including salesrelated activities could be adversely affected disruptive activities could include continued business closures in impacted areas further or continued restrictions on our employees’ and other service providers’ ability to travel impacts to productivity if our employees or their family members experience health issues and potential delays in hiring and onboarding mainly in our general and administrative functions the covid19 pandemic could also impact our data center operations including potential disruptions to the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these thirdparty systems and primary vendors we rely on for products and services that allow our employees to work remotely further we may experience increased cyberattacks and security challenges as our global employee base and vendors and other third parties work remotely on less secure systems 

the extent and continued impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak future infection spikes resulting in additional preventative measures the availability and timing of the distribution of an effective vaccine the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing and nature of a potential economic recovery government responses including the effectiveness extent and duration of efforts to limit the spread and impact of the disease such as “shelter in place” and similar government directives all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable while our revenues billings and earnings are relatively 

predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods and could cause our future results of operations to vary significantly from period to period 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic also may heighten other risks including significant volatility in the global markets trading prices of our common stock interest rate and foreign currency described in this ‘‘risk factors’’ section risks caused or heightened by the covid19 pandemic may continue for the duration of and possibly beyond the covid19 pandemic for an indefinite period 

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

we participate in intensely competitive markets and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be harmed 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for digital workflow products matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

• large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors and large integrated systems vendors 

• new entrants to the market developing technologies to solve similar problems in different ways 

• solutions developed inhouse by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools 

• vendors of infrastructureasaservice platformasaservice and development operations and 

• established and emerging cloud vendors 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to ours as our offerings have become more widely adopted and successful in the market more competitors are developing competing offerings many of our existing competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships including at the executive level of large enterprises larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do while we believe that our platform and products can largely be complementary to large established systems that traditionally operate as “systems of record” competitors may try to enter our space they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices they may utilize acquisitions integrations or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages they may reduce the price of competing products or subscriptions or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions causing our products to appear relatively more expensive they may also invest in industryspecific solutions that purport to provide a unique solution for that industry additional companies may expand their services to compete with our services or we may shift our products and services to compete with current and future competitors in adjacent markets we have expanded and expect to continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets and the use of our platform by developers as a result we expect increasing competition from companies focused on these other markets smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressures including in the it market which includes our more mature offerings and from which we derive a large portion of our revenues for these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales and margins losses or failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological market and customer developments our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases on digital technologies and shift to modern cloudbased infrastructure and agile ways of working as digital transformation accelerates across the enterprise capabilities such as artificial intelligence machine learning robotic process automation lowcode application development database scalability consumergrade user experiences collaboration internetconnected devices security cryptography internal software development operations and application and service awareness become increasingly relevant to customers’ evolving needs our customers and prospective customers are either facing competing imperatives to adopt digital technologies or have already been built on fullydigital modern dynamic it technologies accordingly to compete effectively we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies knowing that we cannot make substantial investments in all of them accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs priorities and adoption practices including their technology infrastructures and buying and budgetary practices invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet the very high performance 

expectations of our customers successfully deliver new scalable platform and database technologies and products to meet these needs and priorities efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments expand our offerings into industries and to buyers who are not familiar with our offerings profitably market and sell products to companies and buyers in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience and effectively deliver directly or through our partner ecosystem the business process planning it systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful if we fail to meet any of these requirements our competitive position strategic relevance and business prospects may be harmed 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented 35 and 34 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues including sales to enterprises in the public sector outside the united states the “us” the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to different regulatory political and economic risks from those in the us we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing partnership arrangements personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers a factor affecting our growth has generally been lower in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established and where there may be increased or changing regulations and operational and intellectual property risks as compared to north america australia and western europe an increasing proportion of the large enterprises that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including hiring qualified sales management personnel penetrating the target market anticipating and ensuring compliance with regulatory developments and managing foreign operations in such locales 

risks inherent with making our products and services available in international markets include without limitation 

• compliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations including employment tax competition requirements to have local partners local entity ownership limitations technology transfer or sharing requirements data residency and transfer laws and regulations privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

• compliance by us and our business partners with international bribery and anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act and the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” 

• the risk that illegal or unethical activities of our local employees or business partners will be attributed to or result in liability to us or damage to our reputation 

• the risk that we will fail to meet the requirements of the rules and regulations relating to government or other public sector contracting 

• longer and potentially more complex sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties 

• tax treatment of revenues from international sources and changes to tax codes including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

• different pricing and distribution environments 

• foreign currency fluctuations which may cause transactional and translational remeasurement losses 

• potential changes in international trade policies tariffs agreements and practices including the adoption and expansion of formal or informal trade restrictions or regulatory frameworks favoring local competitors 

• potential threatening statesponsored actions including cybersecurity threats directed at local data centers customers or endusers 

• local business practices and cultural norms that may favor local competitors 

• localization of our services including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses and 

• natural disasters acts of war terrorism or pandemics 

if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

doing business with the public sector including federal state and local governments and agencies in the us and heavilyregulated organizations and governments globally subjects us to risks related to the government procurement process budget decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations termination of contracts and compliance with government contracting requirements 

we provide products and services to the us federal state and local governments and heavilyregulated organizations directly and through our partners we have made and may continue to make significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the federal state and local government sectors this includes obtaining additional cloud security certification requirements for the servicenow government community cloud such as the us federal risk and authorization management program “fedramp” high provisional authority to operate “pato” from the joint authorization board and the us department of defense security requirements guide impact level 4 pato for cloud computing by the defense information systems agency however government certification requirements may change or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more government certifications including those mentioned above as a result if such requirements change our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we demonstrate that we meet any revised certification requirements 

a substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our distributor resellers or service provider partners doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive timeconsuming and may in certain circumstances be subject to political influence we incur significant upfront time and expense which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs without any assurance that we or a thirdparty distributor reseller or service provider will win a contract beyond this demand for our products and services may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown further if we are or our partner is successful in receiving a contract award that award could be challenged by one or more aggrieved bidders through the applicable bid protest process bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award in the event a bid protest is unsuccessful the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 

in addition public sector customers may have contractual statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our thirdparty distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default though such risk may be assumed by such thirdparty distributor or reseller if a contract is terminated for convenience we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses if a contract is terminated due to a default we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities further entities providing services to governments are required to comply with a variety of complex laws regulations and contractual provisions relating to the formation administration or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts these may include rights with respect to price protection the accuracy of information provided to the government contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies and other obligations that are particular to government contracts such as termination rights these obligations may apply to us andor thirdparty resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control such parties’ noncompliance could impose repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues 

in addition federal state and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements if as a result of an audit it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business all of which may cause us to suffer reputational harm 

further we are increasingly doing business in heavily regulated industries such as the financial services and health care industries current and prospective customers such as those in these industries may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding thirdparty vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers in addition regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward thirdparty vendors generally or us in particular that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet in addition customers in these heavilyregulated areas often have a right to conduct audits of our systems products and practices if one or more customers determines that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business 

our customers also include several nonus governments to which government procurement law risks similar to those present in us government contracting also apply particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less 

established in addition compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources in certain jurisdictions our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with applicable anticorruption and antibribery laws including the fcpa and similar laws of other countries and general trade regulations we could be subject to penalties and civil andor criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will inevitably do more business with large enterprises and the public sector in countries that are perceived to have heightened levels of public sector corruption increased business in countries perceived to have heightened levels of corruption could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from our business operations we have implemented and continue to update our compliance program but there is a risk that our employees and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations could take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible in addition we are subject to compliance with general trade regulations relating to doing business outside the us including certain restrictions on conducting trade in certain restricted countries or with certain entities or individuals any violation of the fcpa other applicable anticorruption and antibribery laws or general trade regulations by our employees or our thirdparty intermediaries could subject us to significant risks and result in regulatory investigations whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage andor severe criminal or civil sanctions which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation business operating results and prospects 

we rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues and if these partners fail to perform our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

an increasing portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners including managed service providers and resellers increasingly we and our customers rely on our partners to provide professional services including customer implementations and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand while we provide our partners with training and programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may require significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our corporate policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain these partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

national and local governments or agencies have adopted and may continue to adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium the use of data in contexts referred to as artificial intelligence and machine learning and data sovereignty or residency requirements concerning the location of data centers and support services as a cloudbased service provider we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers located in and support provided from different jurisdictions changing laws regulations and standards applying to the collection use sharing transfer or other processing of data including personal data could affect our ability to develop our products and services to maximize their utility as well as our customers’ ability to use data or share data with service providers such changes may restrict our ability to use store or otherwise process data of our customers in connection with providing and supporting our services in some cases this could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally 

the costs of compliance with and other obligations imposed by the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” the ruling of the european court of justice in schrems v facebook ireland limited and interpretations of that ruling by regulators and customers recommendations issued by the european data protection board new standard contractual clauses issued by the european commission the california consumer privacy act as recently amended by a voterapproved proposition the “ccpa” and other privacy data residency sovereignty and transfer laws regulations and standards including selfregulatory standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices 

andor policies may limit the development use and adoption of our services including artificial intelligence and machine learning features and could reduce overall demand for our services in addition noncompliance could result in proceedings or investigations against us by regulatory authorities or others lead to significant fines damages orders or reputational harm and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results changes in our developed or acquired products and how such products utilize data could also alter or increase our compliance requirements as a result our innovation and business drivers in developing or acquiring new and emerging technologies and the demand for our products could be impacted 

delays in the release of or actual or perceived defects in our products may slow the adoption of our latest technologies reduce our ability to efficiently provide services decrease customer satisfaction and adversely impact sales of additional products 

we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products the success of any release depends on a number of factors including our ability to manage the risks associated with quality or other defects or deficiencies delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introduction if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are difficult to implement customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted customer satisfaction may decrease our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced and our growth prospects may be harmed 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

we have acquired or invested in companies and technologies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate and execute potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies although we conduct reasonably extensive due diligence with each of the entities we engage for a strategic transaction our due diligence efforts may not reveal every material concern that may exist either with respect to the target entity or our assumptions surrounding the resulting combination these strategic transactions involve numerous risks including 

• assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies 

• failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment 

• potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 

• inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business 

• potential adverse tax consequences 

• disruption to our business and diversion of management attention and other resources 

• potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers 

• dependence on acquired technologies or licenses for which alternatives may not be available to us without significant cost or complexity 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• introducing increased complexity and burden to maintain the technology platform or introducing vulnerabilities or threats by integrating acquired technologies 

• increased data privacy or security compliance requirements resulting from integrating the acquired technology or company with ours 

• impairment to our investments if our investees are unable to obtain future funding on favorable terms or at all and 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses 

in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity or equitylinked securities to pay for any future acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or our stock price furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect our stock price the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to the operation of our business 

if we or our thirdparty service providers suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive data including personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and in some cases government information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss these measures may be breached because of employee error or thirdparty actions including unintentional events or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information for example third parties have attempted to fraudulently induce employees contractors or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers’ data and we have been the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets computer malware ransomware viruses hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and they have occurred on our and our thirdparty service providers’ systems in the past and may occur again on these systems in the future because techniques used to sabotage obtain unauthorized access to systems or prohibit authorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched against a target we have been and may continue to be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures this may also include underlying infiltration of preexisting systems including those of our thirdparty service providers or customers perpetrated by more sophisticated attackers such as the late 2020 foreign cybersecurity attack on a us it company we devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures however as cybersecurity threats develop and grow more complex over time it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure a security breach suffered by us or our thirdparty service providers an attack against our service availability or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation service level agreement claims indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other significant costs and liabilities in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of paying to access data investigating remediating eliminating complying with notice obligations and implementing additional measures designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents we also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 

further in most instances our customers administer access to the data held in their particular instance for their employees and service providers while we offer tools and support customers are not required to utilize them and accordingly or for other reasons a customer may suffer a cybersecurity event on its own systems unrelated to our own and allow a malicious actor to obtain access to the customer’s information held on our platform even if such a breach is unrelated to our security programs or practices such breach could result in our incurring significant economic and operational costs in investigating remediating eliminating and implementing additional measures to further protect our customers from their own vulnerabilities and could result in reputational harm to us 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors from time to time in the ordinary course of business there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example our current president and chief executive officer was appointed in november 2019 and our current chief financial officer was appointed in january 2020 while we seek to manage these transitions carefully including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for diverse talented product and engineering sales and operations employees we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel and we may experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highlyskilled employees with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle hyderabad dublin london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense many of our employees including all of our executive officers are employed “atwill” and may terminate their employment with us at any time if we fail to attract 

new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

in addition we believe our corporate culture of fostering innovation teamwork and employee satisfaction has been a key contributor to our success to date as we continue to grow and expand globally and navigate shifting workforce priorities including an extended period of time in which our employees are working from their home locations or an increase in remote workers we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success 

lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry our competitors other third parties and nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us moreover the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses for example we have recorded material charges for legal settlements of such claims in the past 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merit we may incur substantial costs and attorney’s fees and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of 

others we could be required to pay substantial damages andor make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering or modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners obtain costly licenses on their behalf andor refund fees or other payments previously paid to us further upon expiration of the term of any agreements that allow us to use thirdparty intellectual property we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all in which case we may face intellectual property litigation the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers this could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors and cause a substantial decline in our stock price any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under patent and other intellectual property protections of the us and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents acquired in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer services the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights or available remedies may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have initiated and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into other products and services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products and services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our products and services we may be 

subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our products and services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from distributing our products and services 

various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers may cause implementations of our products to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful 

our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers either through us or our partners further our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers or other factors may cause implementations to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful for example changes in the functional requirements of our customers delays in timeline or deviations from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project as a result of these and other risks we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase implementation and enablement of our products some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers’ expectations which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented some customers may lack the employee talent or organizational capacity to manage a digital transformation such as our offering and as a consequence may be unable to see the benefits of our products unsuccessful lengthy or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers reputational harm and opportunities for competitors to displace our products each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future for example we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may result from errors we make in developing delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service or ransomware attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data centers operated by several different providers located around the world and serve certain of our customers using data center facilities operated by public cloud service providers these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence despite precautions taken at these centers problems at these centers have occurred resulting in interruptions in our services such problems could occur again and result in similar or lengthier service interruptions and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers similarly customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet the occurrence of payment delays service credit warranty or termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our service level credit accruals other increased expenses or risks of litigation we may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

risks related to the financial performance or financial position of our business 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors some of which are beyond our control for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the 

expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our financial performance to vary widely or cause our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include 

• our ability to attract new customers retain and increase sales to existing customers and satisfy customers’ requirements 

• changes in our mix of products and services including changes in our mix of cloud and selfhosted offerings market penetration of our products or use of our products by our customers 

• our ability to increase sales of certain new products 

• volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and our ability to effectively hedge our foreign currency exposure 

• the rate of expansion retention and productivity of our sales and engineering organizations 

• the number of new employees added 

• the cost timing and management effort for our development of new products and services 

• general economic conditions that may adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to business operation and expansion 

• seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements 

• the length and complexity of the sales cycle and certification process for our services especially for sales to larger enterprises government and regulated organizations 

• changes in the size and complexity of our customer relationships 

• changes to our management sales and account management teams as we scale and evolve business priorities 

• changes in our or our competitors’ pricing policies 

• significant security breaches technical difficulties or interruptions of our services 

• new solutions or products introduced by our competitors 

• changes in effective tax rates 

• changes in the average contract term of our customer agreements timing of renewals renewal rates expansion within our existing customers and billings duration 

• the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers 

• extraordinary expenses such as litigation costs or damages including settlement payments 

• the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the followon costs of integration including the tax effects of acquisitions 

• changes in laws or regulations impacting the delivery of our services 

• our ability to comply with privacy laws and regulations 

• significant litigation or regulatory actions relating to claims of intellectual property infringement violation of privacy laws employment matters or any other significant matter 

• the amount and timing of equity awards and the related financial statement expenses 

• the impact of new accounting pronouncements and 

• our ability to accurately estimate the total addressable market for our products and services 

because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions net new annual contract value from new subscriptions and expansion contracts entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenues for the duration of the subscription term as a result a significant portion of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods consequently a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period in addition our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited 

further a decline in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that period but they will negatively affect our revenues in future periods accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally due to the complexity of certain customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment 

required under accounting standard codification topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers “topic 606”” depends on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period 

in addition a decrease in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease such as an increase in billings duration the dollar value of contracts with future start dates or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

as our business grows we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our longerterm revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future due to a number of reasons which may include maturation of our business increasing competition or decrease in the growth of our overall market we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities which may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business you should not rely on our revenue for any prior periods as any indication of our future revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our stock price could be volatile 

changes in our effective tax rate or rejection of our tax positions may adversely affect our financial position and results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law which could affect our results of operations in the period issued many countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period further many of our most important intangible assets are held outside the us and are subject to intercompany agreements regarding the development and distribution of those assets to other jurisdictions with potential challenge under permanent establishment or transfer pricing principles while we believe that our position is appropriate and well founded in the event that our position was to be successfully challenged by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions we may become subject to significant tax liabilities which could harm our financial position and financial results 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the reasonable assurance level of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse if it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory 

authorities and we could incur substantial expenses we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency 

risks related to general economic conditions 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics such as covid19 terrorism political unrest telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattacks geopolitical instability war the effects of climate change such as drought wildfires hurricanes increased storm severity and sea level rise and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain the majority of our research and development activities offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event in addition the impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving we may be subject to increased regulations reporting requirements standards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business 

global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us from time to time the us and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical and economic instability high levels of credit defaults international trade disputes falling demand for various goods and services high levels of persistent unemployment wage and income stagnation restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies international trade agreements trade restrictions and overall economic uncertainty these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

for example the covid19 pandemic global growth rates tariffs or trade relations between the us and china or other countries increased restrictions on international data transfers economic political and labor conditions including the impact on trade or any other instability surrounding the united kingdom’s exit from the eu brexit political uncertainty and other geopolitical events could directly or indirectly affect our business in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments or assumptions about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to political and economic uncertainty globally 

we use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements further unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions moreover for a number of reasons including our limited experience with these hedging contracts we may not seek or be able to establish a perfect correlation 

between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and could expose us to a greater overall risk of loss than if we had not hedged 

risks related to our 2030 notes and 2022 notes 

our debt service obligations including the 2030 notes may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2020 we have 15 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2030 notes payable outstanding due on september 1 2030 as described in note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our ability to make payments on repay or refinance the 2030 notes in the future will depend on our future performance which is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control if we decide to refinance the 2030 notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the 2030 notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

• impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and 

• due to limitations within the debt instruments restrict our ability to grant liens on property enter into certain mergers dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole materially change our business or incur subsidiary indebtedness subject to customary exceptions 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in the indentures governing the 2030 notes our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities downgrades in our credit ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the business day immediately preceding february 1 2022 the holders of the 2022 notes may elect to convert their notes during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 17518 the “conversion condition” the conversion condition for the 2022 notes was met for all the quarters ended june 30 2018 through december 31 2020 except for the quarter ended december 31 2018 therefore our 2022 notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2021 except for the quarter ended march 31 2019 we have settled conversion requests and expect to settle additional conversion requests prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes also we intend to continue to settle all of our conversion obligations in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on early conversions of the 2022 notes converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt discount and issuance cost on the settlement date 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the 2022 notes we entered into convertible note hedge the “2022 note hedge” transactions with certain financial institutions “option counterparties” we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock the “2022 warrants” the actual number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the automatic exercise of the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants if any is unknown at this time refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary 

market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes or following any repurchase of the 2022 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indenture or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in our stock price or the 2022 notes price which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the 2022 notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on our stock price or the 2022 notes price will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 notes and the resulting amount of cash andor number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the 2022 notes 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 note hedge 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the stock price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition technology companies in general have highly volatile stock prices and the volatility in stock price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting our stock price some of which are beyond our control include

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business this could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in our stock price 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangements any return to stockholders will be limited to increased stock price if any 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law 2030 notes or our 2022 notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and therefore depress our stock price 

our restated certificate of incorporation as amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress our stock price by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

• established a classified board so not all directors are elected at one time although our board will be fully declassified by our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders 

• permit the board to establish the number of directors 

• provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of 66 23 of our shareholders 

• require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation as amended and restated bylaws 

• authorize issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a shareholder rights plan

• provide that the board is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our restated bylaws and 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at annual shareholder meetings though our restated bylaws have shareholder proxy access 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 notes or change in control repurchase event provisions of our 2030 notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or change in control repurchase event

covid19 environment 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty adversely impacted the business of our customers partners and vendors and impacted our business and results of operations as of the filing date the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain we are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the covid19 pandemic across our business while our revenues billings and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the covid19 pandemic along with the seasonality we historically experience may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods if at all and could cause our future results of operations to vary significantly from period to period as the uncertainty continues we may experience an increase in curtailed customer demand reduced customer spend or contract duration delayed collections lengthened payment terms lengthened sales cycles or competition due to changes in terms and conditions and pricing of our competitors’ products and services our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods could be materially adversely affected additionally it is unclear to what extent certain reduction in expenditures noted in the current year due to actions taken in response to covid19 will continue to be reduced below historical levels the extent and continued impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak government responses including the effectiveness extent and duration of mitigation efforts such as “shelter in place” and similar directives impact on our customers sales cycles and ability to generate new business impact on our customer industry or employee events extent of delays in hiring and onboarding new employees mainly in our general and administrative functions and effect on our partners vendors and supply chains all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we focused on maintaining business continuity helping our employees customers and communities and preparing for the future and the longterm success of our business in 2020 we released four emergency response applications to help customers navigate the covid19 pandemic management and the safe workplace applications a fourapplication suite and dashboard designed to help companies manage the essential steps for returning employees to the workplace and to support their health and safety additionally we canceled our inperson annual knowledge user conference “knowledge” and replaced it with a digital event experience in the first quarter of 2020 we also temporarily closed most of our offices and encouraged our employees to work remotely these changes remain in effect in the first quarter of 2021 and could extend into future quarters the impact if any of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain oper ations including financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures see the section “risk factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

overview 

  

servicenow’s purpose is to make the world of work work better for people we believe that people want the technology they use in their work to be more efficient and easier to use we build applications to meet that demand by automating existing processes and creating efficient digitized workflows with a consumer grade user experience our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments systems and processes of a business when work flows naturally great experiences follow we primarily deliver our software via the internet as a service through a simple and easytouse interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings and customers can easily build their custom applications in a minority of cases customers choose to host our software by themselves or through a thirdparty service provider 

we generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related standard and enhanced support including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors including duration of subscription term volume mix of products purchased and discounts we generate sales through our direct sales team and to a lesser extent indirectly through resale partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel our professional services organization is focused on strategic advisory implementation and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth 

key business metrics 

remaining performance obligations transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations “rpo” represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes deferred revenue and noncancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods rpo excludes contracts that are billed in arrears such as certain time and materials contracts as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance current remaining performance obligations “crpo” represents rpo that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2020 our rpo was 89 billion of which 49 represented crpo factors that may cause our rpo to vary from period to period include the following 

• foreign currency exchange rates  while a majority of our contracts have historically been in us dollars an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies particularly the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our rpo 

• mix of offerings  in a minority of cases we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a thirdparty service provider in selfhosted offerings we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result such revenue is excluded from rpo 

  

• subscription start date  from time to time we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in rpo if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date 

  

• timing of contract renewals  while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date for example in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date in other cases prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired 

  

• contract duration  while we typically enter into multiyear subscription services the duration of our contracts varies further we continue to see an increase in the number of 12month agreements entered into with the us federal government throughout the year which has been the highest in the quarter ended september 30 driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures we sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12month or shorter term to enable the contracts to coterminate with the existing contract the contract duration will cause variability in our rpo 

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annual contract value “acv” greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 1093 891 and 682 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate “gult” data universal numbering system “duns” number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity accordingly we restate previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million calculations to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we believe information regarding the total number of customers with acv greater than 1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the now platform 

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies a calculation of free cash flow is provided below 



1 free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2018 include the effect of 82 million and 145 million respectively relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts which is significantly higher with new customers as well as expansion with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 additionally we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended march 31 and september 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and payouts under our bonus plans 

renewal rate we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period divided by the sum of i the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and ii the total acv from all customers lost during the period accordingly our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed further our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewal a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal additionally starting in 2020 we simplified our methodology related to contracts less than 12 months to derive acv used to calculate renewal rate previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments or methodology simplification to allow for comparability while the previously disclosed renewal rates for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were restated due to the methodology simplification to allow for comparability there were no material changes to such previously disclosed renewal rates our renewal rate was 98 for each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful 

billings we define billings a nongaap financial measure as gaap revenues recognized plus the change in total gaap unbilled receivables deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the calculation of billings is provided below 



1 as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers renewal contracts expansion contracts contracts with new customers and contracts for professional services and training factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following 

• billings duration  while we typically bill customers annually in advance for our subscription services customers sometimes request and we accommodate billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12month term 

• contract start date  from time to time we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date 

• foreign currency exchange rates  while a majority of our billings have historically been in us dollars an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies particularly the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will cause variability in our billings foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of 21 million and 68 million on billings for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

• timing of contract renewals while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date for example in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date in other cases prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired 

• seasonality  we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as expansion with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year the increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures and the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by december 31 furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloudoffering contracts with a future start date from our billings unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance further the seasonal factors could be heightened due to the impact of the current gross domestic product contraction and other impacts unknown at this time on our customers and sales cycles caused by the covid19 pandemic 

while we believe billings is one indicator of the performance of our business due to the factors described above an increase or decrease in billings may not reflect the actual performance for that reporting period 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings results we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented notwithstanding the adjustments described above the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals for which no adjustments have been presented 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term for our cloud services we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally noncancelable and without any refundtype provisions 

subscription revenues also include revenues from selfhosted offerings in which customers deploy or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software for these contracts we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price “ssp” basis the transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term 

we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations for these contracts the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment 

deferred commissions 

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term additionally for selfhosted offerings consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for selfhosted offerings a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the selfhosted offering is made available determining the period of benefit including average renewal term requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts our technology life cycle and other factors 

  

business combinations 

the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows discount rates the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

income taxes 

  

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense benefit and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence we have determined that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31 2020 we recognized an income tax benefit of 574 million due to the release of the valuation allowance on the irish deferred tax assets for the year ended december 31 2019 these irish deferred tax assets were created primarily as a result of the difference between the tax basis in our irish subsidiary and the cost reported in our consolidated financial statements resulting from the transfer of intangible assets to the irish subsidiary as part of our foreign restructuring in 2018 management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future in determining the need or continued need for a valuation allowance we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes among other things emergence from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years during the fourth quarter of 2020 historical earnings future growth forecasted earnings and future taxable income 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination

components of results of operations 

  

revenues 

subscription revenues  subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both selfhosted offerings and cloudbased subscription offerings and related standard and enhanced support and updates if any to the subscription service during the subscription term for our cloudbased offerings we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term for selfhosted offerings a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin pricing includes multiple instances hosting and support services data backup and disaster recovery services as well as future updates when and if available offered during the subscription term we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal our contracts are generally noncancelable during the subscription term though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform 

professional services and other revenues  our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered onsite or through publicly available classes typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice 

we sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization we also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners we also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel through both our direct team and indirect channel sales revenues from our direct sales organization represented 81 82 and 84 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively for purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization 

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription revenues  cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use amortization of intangible assets expenses associated with software it services and dedicated customer support personnelrelated costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support including salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation and allocated overhead

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes consists of federal state and foreign income taxes due to cumulative losses we maintain a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including but not limited to earnings history projected future outcomes industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our us and foreign deferred tax assets 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

revenues 



subscription revenues increased by 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count included in subscription revenues is 205 million and 164 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we expect subscription revenues for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 we continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic in 2021 and its impact on customer acquisition and renewal rates 

our expectations for revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31 2021 are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2020 

subscription revenues consist of the following 



our digital workflow products include the now platform it service management it business management devops it asset management security operations governance risk and compliance hr service delivery safe workplace suite of applications workplace service delivery legal service delivery customer service management field service management connected operations app engine and integrationhub and are generally priced on a per user basis our itom products are generally priced on a per node physical or virtual server basis in previously issued consolidated financial statements we referred to digital workflow products as “service management products” 

professional services and other revenues increased by 28 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year due to an increase in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers we expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 



cost of subscription revenues increased by 181 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount and increased costs to support the growth of our subscription offerings personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses increased by 80 million and depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity increased by 88 million as compared to the prior year in addition amortization of intangibles increased by 12 million as a result of acquisitions 

we expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances 

our subscription gross profit percentage was 83 for each of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we expect our subscription gross profit percentage to slightly decrease for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased by 9 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in increase of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation offset by a decrease in thirdparty implementation costs as we continue to invest and deploy our internal professional service organization to increase their utilization and a reduction in travel expenses resulting from travel restrictions due to the covid19 pandemic 

our professional services and other gross loss percentage decreased to 10 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 20 in the prior year primarily driven by the increased utilization of our internal professional services organization and the reduction in certain travel expenses we expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to increase for the year ending december 31 2021 as we expect utilization of our internal professional services organization to stabilize resulting in additional support cost for the business growth and increases in travel expenses compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

sales and marketing 



sales and marketing expenses increased by 321 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 255 million compared to the prior year amortization of deferred commissions and thirdparty referral fees increased by 51 million compared to the prior year due to an increase in contracts with new customers expansion and renewal contracts other sales and marketing program expenses which include branding purchase of advertising and market data and outside services increased by 73 million compared to the prior year 

amid the ongoing regulatory restrictions imposed by governments worldwide in response to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed most of our offices to ensure the wellbeing and safety of our global employees office staff and communities and encouraged our employees to work remotely and limit travel further in response to the pandemic we canceled knowledge and other inperson events and either replaced them with digital events or postponed them to future periods and implemented travel restrictions which resulted in a decrease of 66 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to prior year 

despite the uncertainty around the continued impact of covid19 and its duration we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as we continue to expand our direct sales organization increase our marketing activities grow our international operations and build brand awareness 

research and development 



research and development expenses increased by 276 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 251 million compared to prior year the remaining increase was primarily due to increase in hosting costs and data center related depreciation costs to support research and development activities  

  we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses increased by 115 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation and overhead expenses of 91 million and 12 million increase in outside services compared to the prior year primarily from digital transformation projects across functions to improve processes 

we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december 31 2021 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as we continue to hire new employees and focus on digital transformation 

stockbased compensation 



stockbased compensation increased by 208 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards 

stockbased compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2020 we expect stockbased compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december 31 2021 as we continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31 2020 but we expect this to decline over time as we continue to grow 

foreign currency exchange 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 35 and 34 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound sterling during the year ended december 31 2020 had a favorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2020 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2019 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported subscription revenues would have been 14 million lower the impact from the foreign currency movements was not material for professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 

in addition because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies during the year ended december 31 2020 for the most part had an unfavorable impact but overall did not have a material impact if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2020 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2019 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period 

interest expense 



interest expense slightly decreased during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs as a result of the 2022 notes repurchase offset by increase in debt discount issuance cost and interest related to 2030 notes for the year ending december 31 2021 we expect to incur approximately 30 million related to the 2030 notes and 2022 notes 

other income expense net 



nm  not meaningful 

other income expense net decreased by 75 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year primarily driven by loss on extinguishment resulting from the 2022 notes repurchase and the early conversions of 47 million and increase in foreign currency exchange loss net of derivative contracts of 13 million compared to the prior year additionally interest income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year despite an increase in investments primarily due to the decline in interest rates during the year and change in our investment strategy to higher quality bonds in response to the global market disruptions and uncertainties resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes 



  

our effective tax rate was 21 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 833 for the prior year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the irish deferred tax assets of 574 million in the year ended december 31 2019 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates the valuation allowance in the us and the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights see note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we maintained a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



1 the amounts for the three months ended december 31 2019 reflect the impact of an income tax benefit of 574 million from the release of the valuation allowance on the irish deferred tax assets refer to note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented due to increases in headcount data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference partially offset by related proceeds marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we generally conduct in that quarter however during the year ended december 31 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we took several measures to ensure the wellbeing and safety of our employees including reduction of travel and cancellation of live events to be replaced with digital events accordingly timing and amount of marketing expense might not be consistent with historical trends prior to covid19 nonetheless we still anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2020 we had 3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 450 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries and 417 million is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition we had 1 billion in longterm investments that provide additional capital resources we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 

in august 2020 we issued 140 fixed rate tenyear notes with an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion due on september 1 2030 the “2030 notes” the 2030 notes were issued at 9963 of principal and we incurred approximately 13 million for debt issuance costs interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on march 1 2021 and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on september 1 2030 the 2030 notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 notes contain customary events of default and customary covenants that among others and subject to exceptions restrict the company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to specified properties 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrants transactions with certain financial institutions the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price of the 2022 notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30 2018 through december 31 2020 except for the quarter ended december 31 2018 therefore our 2022 notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2021 except for the quarter ended march 31 2019 because the conversion condition for the 2022 notes was not met for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the impact of the 2022 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 notes in cash during the year ended december 31 2020 we paid cash to settle 116 million in principal of the 2022 notes additionally we repurchased 497 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 notes the “2022 notes repurchase” which was accounted for as a debt extinguishment we used proceeds from the partial unwind of the 2022 note hedge of 11 billion for the 2022 notes repurchase 

based on conversion requests received through the filing date we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately 34 million in principal amount of the 2022 notes during the first quarter of 2021 we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement after the first quarter of 2021 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we issued 23 million shares of our common stock upon partial unwind of the 2022 warrants we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants as the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants will be net share settled there will be no impact on our liquidity the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the remaining portion of the 2022 warrants which will be september 1 2022 in addition we issued 43 million shares of our common stock upon the automatic exercise of a portion of the 2018 warrants during the year ended december 31 2019 the 2018 warrants were no longer outstanding as of june 30 2019 refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however we anticipate our current cash cash equivalents and investments balance and anticipated cash flows generated from operations based on our current business plan and revenue prospects will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the repayment of any early conversions of our 2022 notes debt service costs expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of property and equipment intangibles and investments in office facilities to accommodate our operations for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions andor debt retirements if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or repay our 2022 notes at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 12 billion for the prior year the net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increase in adjustments for noncash items to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operations driven by stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization from increased capital expenditures and deferred commissions and the overall favorable impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by the repayment of 2022 notes attributable to debt discount 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 15 billion compared to 724 million for the prior year the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 566 million increase in net purchases of investments 154 million increase in capital expenditures related to infrastructure hardware equipment as well as office related expenditures to support our headcount growth and 40 million net increase in business combinations net of cash and restricted cash acquired and purchases of intangibles 

financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 597 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 302 million for the prior year due to proceeds of 15 billion from the issuance of the 2030 notes net of discount and issuance costs offset by the 2022 notes repurchase of 16 billion attributable to principal funded in part by the proceeds received from the partial unwind of the 2022 note hedge of 11 billion in addition an increase in proceeds from employee equity plans by 38 million was offset by a 99 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table represents our future noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 aggregated by type 



1 consists of future noncancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for offices and data centers 

2 consists of future minimum payments under noncancelable purchase commitments related to our daily business operations not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2021 and future years if we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of december 31 2020 we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately 36 million in aggregate 

3 for additional information regarding our longterm debt refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition to the obligations in the table above 20 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2020 it is uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 




 



foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and british pound sterling and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar relative to these currencies and conversely are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these currencies revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71 during each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

  

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded 

a hypothetical 10 increase in the us dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 47 million and 31 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and an increase in operating loss of 23 million for the year ended december 31 2018 this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

these derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty while the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes refer to note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 46 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments as of december 31 2020 this amount was invested primarily in money market funds certificates of deposit corporate notes and bonds government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poor’s baa2 by moody’s or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 29 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2019 we had an aggregate of 27 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 14 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in august 2020 we issued 140 fixed rate tenyear notes with an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion due on september 1 2030 the “2030 notes” the 2030 notes were issued at 9963 of principal and we incurred approximately 13 million for debt issuance costs interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on march 1 2021 and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on september 1 2030 the 2030 notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 notes contain customary events of default and covenants that among others and subject to exceptions restrict the company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to specified properties 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because these instruments do not bear interest we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 notes associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of our 2022 notes is exposed to interest rate risks generally the fair market value of our 2022 notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of the 2022 notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature and will generally increase as the stock price increases 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 28 million and 22 million respectively of equity investments in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value we are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as a result we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss in future periods due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities these changes could be material based on market conditions and events

we deliver digital workflows on a single enterprise cloud platform called the now platform® our product portfolio is currently focused on providing information technology it employee and customer workflows in prepackaged product offerings we also enable our customers to use the now platform app engine to design and build workflow applications that are purpose built for their own business 

getting a job done in an enterprise what we call a “workflow” usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together often they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes one example to illustrate is the new hire process when a new employee is hired he or she needs to be set up in the employer’s hr system of record and payroll have a desk assigned get a computer get access to necessary internal systems and perform other tasks successfully onboarding the new employee requires different departments of the business utilizing different systems and databases to coordinate and complete their specific tasks our digital workflow platform transforms the old manual ways of completing these tasks a new employee’s manager approves the new hire’s specifics in the hr systems that approval triggers a notification to the facilities team so they can assign a desk to the new employee that assignment triggers a notification to the it group for computer and systems access configuration etc each person acting in this workflow only needs to use the now platform the digital management of this workflow is possible because our technology platform hides the complexity of working across multiple siloed departments and systems of record to make work flow more seamlessly this enables our customers to deliver their employees the experiences they want and their customers the service they expect our digital workflow management tools are applied across an enterprise and in complex and sophisticated workflows 

the now platform is the foundation of our it employee and customer workflow offerings the now platform has one code base and one data model which allows our applications and those developed by our customers to work seamlessly with each other any workflow used in an enterprise is a candidate for a now platformbased application our native mobile applications greatly assist in the rollout of automated workflows to our customer’s employees thirdparty developers can also build applications on the now platform app engine and can make them available for download at our servicenow store 

we primarily deliver our software via the internet as a service through a simple and easytouse interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings and customers can easily build their custom applications in a minority of cases customers choose to host our software by themselves or through a thirdparty service provider 

we market and sell our products and services to enterprises across industries including government financial services healthcare telecommunications manufacturing it services technology oil and gas education and consumer products we sell our products through subscription services and primarily through direct sales we also offer professional services both directly and through partners to help our customers deploy and utilize our products and platform 

we were incorporated as glidesoft inc in california in june 2004 and changed our name to servicenowcom in february 2006 in may 2012 we reincorporated in delaware as servicenow inc 

our products 

  

our portfolio includes the now platform and prepackaged applications specifically designed for automating it employee and customer workflows the now platform supports custom workflow creation and application development the now platform app engine and a thirdparty application marketplace the servicenow store each of our products and services helps in critical aspects of our customers’ digital transformation process and some of these products and services as captured in the graphic and described below are used in multiple workflows 

the now platform and now platform app engine 

the now platform allows our customers to manage workflows across all of their systems using a common user interface this allows us to deliver specific enterprise applications and services eg employee onboarding as described above which spans multiple departments backend systems and processes across an organization among the many services that our platform supports are workflow automation electronic service catalogs and portals configuration management systems data benchmarking performance analytics encryption and collaboration and development tools all of our products are built on the now platform which allows our customers to create a common user experience to manage workflows across all of their systems 

  

the now platform also powers three native mobile experiences for everyday work across the enterprise virtual agent now mobile and mobile onboarding enterprises can take advantage of consumerlike mobile experiences such as getting help from human resources or ordering a computer from our platform our goal is to make our customers’ work lives as simple easy and mobilefriendly as their personal lives 

our platform also features the now platform app engine which enables customers and thirdparty developers to create test and deploy their own applications they can do so within an integrated development environment while leveraging the single data model and common services of the now platform examples of applications our customers have developed include an application developed by a company with a large network of seasonal retail stores and offices to track progress and identify issues in opening and closing their seasonal retail stores and offices which enabled significant cost savings an application developed by the it office of a university that allocated and billed costs associated with it maintenance allowing the university to retire multiple legacy software systems and an application developed by a mortgage company to ensure that loan files were complete and accurate prior to packaging and selling the loans to investors these types of applications which extend the automation of our customers’ workflows have been developed and deployed by our customers and thirdparty developers using the now platform app engine and many are available through our marketplace servicenow store 

the servicenow store has hundreds of certified ready to use applications from a growing independent software vendor ecosystem the servicenow store enables departments across an enterprise to do more with the now platform with certified applications that complement and extend the now platform into new use cases

remaining performance obligations 

our remaining performance obligations rpo were 66 billion and 49 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively rpo represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes deferred revenue and noncancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods we believe rpo which excludes customer deposits and time and materials contracts is an indicator of customer backlog orders believed to be firm that is aligned with the current revenue recognition standard refer to note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on remaining performance obligations 

research and development 

  

our research and development organization is responsible for the design development testing and validation of our solutions we focus on innovating and developing new services and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality reliability and performance of our existing solutions using emerging technologies we can anticipate customer demands and then bring new services and new versions of existing services to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing applications expand the number of applications on our platform enhance our user experience and develop additional mobile automation and machine intelligence technologies 

acquisitions and investments 

in addition to continuing to invest in our own research and development efforts we have made acquisitions and investments in the past and will continue to assess opportunities for strategic acquisitions and investments to complement our technology and skill sets and expand our product reach our focus is on building out our platform and products through both acquisitions and investments to support customer needs 

competition 

  

we compete in markets that are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as these markets continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

• large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors and large integrated systems vendors 

• new entrants to the market developing technologies to solve similar problems in different ways 

• solutions developed inhouse by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools 

• vendors of infrastructureasaservice platformasaservice providers and development operations and 

• established and emerging cloud vendors 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to ours accordingly we compete with both cloudbased and traditional enterpriseapplication software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer as we continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets we expect increasing competition from platform and application development vendors focused on these markets 

various factors influence purchase decisions in our industry including total cost of ownership level of customer satisfaction breadth and depth of product functionality security adherence to industry standards brand awareness flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices an existing competitor or potential competitor could introduce new technology or more effectively utilize existing technology that reduces demand for our services acquisitions integrations and consolidation by and among other companies in our industry may allow potential competitors to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages which may impact our competitive position in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures larger competitors may also have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other offerings which may enable them to offer their products and services at a lower price as competition intensifies we expect pricing competition to continue or increase 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of us and international copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property ip rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services in certain of our partnership arrangements our partners may develop technology on the now platform that may be subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights that we may agree to with the partner 

we continue to grow our global patent portfolio and ip rights that relate to our platform applications services research and development and other activities our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip we have over 700 us and foreign patents including patents acquired from third parties and over 780 pending patent applications we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other ip right or group of related patents or ip rights we file patent applications to protect our ip and have and may continue to acquire additional patents patent portfolios or patent applications however we cannot be certain that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of value or applicability in addition any patents that have been or may be issued or acquired may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality similar to ours policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we operate may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our ip rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from utilizing their developments to compete with us reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other ip rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other ip rights against us our channel partners or our customers in addition based on our greater visibility expanding solutions footprint and market exposure as a public company we face a higher risk of being the subject of ip infringement claims for example in 2016 we settled two patentrelated litigation matters and recorded a onetime charge of 2700 million related to aggregate legal settlements see “risk factors—lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results” for additional information 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2019  we had 10371 fulltime employees worldwide none of our us employees are represented by a labor union employees in certain european countries are represented by workers’ councils and have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements

risk factors 

tableend

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks our stock price could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

we participate in intensely competitive markets and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be harmed 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for digital workflow products matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to ours many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships including at the executive level of large enterprises where decisionmaking authority is held larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do while we believe that our platform and products can largely be complementary to large and established systems that traditionally operate as “systems of record” competitors may try to enter our space they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices they may utilize acquisitions integrations or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages they may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions causing our products to appear relatively more expensive they may also invest in industryspecific solutions that purport to provide a unique solution for that industry other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services or we may shift our products and services to compete with current and future competitors in adjacent markets we have in the past expanded and we expect to continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in new markets and the use of our platform by developers of custom applications as a result we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and application development vendors focused on these other markets smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressures including in the itsm market which is our more mature offering and from which we derive a large portion of our revenues for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

national and local governments or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium the use of data in contexts referred to as artificial intelligence and machine learning and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data as a cloud based service provider we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers that may be located in different political jurisdictions in addition we utilize data concerning the use of our products and services to continually improve our offering changing laws regulations and standards applying to the collection transfer processing storage or use of data including personal data could affect our ability to develop our products and services to maximize their utility as well as our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services in some cases this could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally examples of recent changes include 

 

the costs of compliance with and other obligations imposed by the gdpr the eprivacy regulation the ccpa and other privacy data residency and data transfer laws regulations and standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices andor policies may limit the development use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services in addition noncompliance could result in proceedings or investigations against us by regulatory authorities or others lead to significant fines or reputational harm and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results for example the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the gdpr we may be subject to fines of up to 4 of our worldwide annual revenue changes in our developed or acquired products and how such products utilize data could alter or increase our compliance requirements as a result the cost of compliance with and other obligations imposed by privacy regulations could increase and our innovation and business drivers in developing or acquiring new and emerging technologies and the demand for our products could be impacted 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and other technology and industry groups have established or may establish various new or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional obligations on us our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business 

if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological market and customer developments our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases on digital technologies and capabilities including public and private cloud solutions and infrastructure massively scalable databases mobile consumer productlike user experiences social collaboration machine learning artificial intelligence internetconnected devices highvelocity robotic automation security cryptography internal software development operations and application and service awareness our customers and prospective customers must choose among competing imperatives to adopt digital technologies or have been built on fullydigital modern dynamic it technologies accordingly to compete effectively we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies knowing that we cannot make substantial investments in all of them accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs priorities and adoption practices including their technology infrastructures and buying and budgetary practices invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet the very high performance expectations of our customers successfully deliver new scalable platform and database technologies and products to meet these needs and priorities efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments expand our offerings into industries and to buyers who are not familiar with our offerings profitably market and sell products to companies and buyers in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience including to companies built on fullydigital modern dynamic it technologies that have not been strong buyers of itsm and itom products and effectively deliver either directly or through our partner ecosystem the business process planning it systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful if we fail to meet any of these requirements our competitive position strategic relevance and business prospects may be harmed 

delays in the release of or actual or perceived defects in new or updated products may slow the adoption of our most recent technologies reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services decrease customer satisfaction and adversely impact sales of additional products to our customers 

we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products the success of any release depends on a number of factors including our ability to manage the risks associated with quality or other defects or deficiencies delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introduction if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are difficult to implement customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted customer satisfaction may decrease our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced and our growth prospects may be harmed 

we do business with federal state and local governments and agencies and heavilyregulated us and foreign organizations as a result we face risks related to the procurement process budget decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations termination of contracts and compliance with government contracting requirements 

we provide products and services to the us government state and local governments and heavilyregulated organizations directly and through our partners we have made and may continue to make significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the federal state and local government sectors this includes obtaining additional cloud security certification requirements for the servicenow govcommunitycloud such as the us federal risk and authorization management program fedramp high impact provisional authority to operate pato from the joint authorization board and the us department of defense impact level 4 pato in the security requirements guide for cloud computing by the defense information systems agency however government certification requirements may change or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more government certifications including those mentioned above as a result our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we obtain such certifications 

a substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive timeconsuming and may in certain circumstances be subject to political influence we incur significant upfront time and expense such as through engaging lobbyists which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs without any assurance that we or a thirdparty distributor or reseller will win a contract beyond this demand for our products and services may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown further if we are or our partner is successful in receiving a bid award that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award in the event a bid protest is unsuccessful the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 

in addition public sector customers may have contractual statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our thirdparty distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default though such risk may be assumed by such thirdparty distributor or reseller if a contract is terminated for convenience we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses if a contract is terminated due to a default we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities further entities providing services to governments are required to comply with a variety of complex laws regulations and contractual provisions relating to the formation administration or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts these may include rights with respect to price protection the accuracy of information provided to the government contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies and other terms that are particular to government contracts such as termination rights these rules may apply to us andor thirdparty resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control such parties’ noncompliance could impose repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues 

in addition federal state and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements if as a result of an audit it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business and we may suffer reputational harm 

further we are increasingly doing business in heavily regulated industries such as the financial services and health care industries current and prospective customers such as those in these industries may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding thirdparty vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers in addition regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward thirdparty vendors generally or our company in particular that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet in addition customers in these heavilyregulated areas often have a right to conduct audits of our systems products and practices in the event that one or more customers determines that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business 

our customers also include a number of nonus governments to which similar procurement budgetary contract and audit risks of us government contracting also apply particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established in addition compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources in certain jurisdictions our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues and if these partners fail to perform our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

an increasing portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners including managed service providers and resellers in addition we increasingly rely on our partners to provide professional services including customer implementations while we provide our partners with training and programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may require significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our corporate policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain these partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented approximately 34 of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to different regulatory political and economic risks from those in the united states the us we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers a factor affecting our growth has generally been lower in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established and where there may be increased or changing regulations and operational and intellectual property risks as compared to north america australia and western europe an increasing proportion of the large enterprises that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including hiring qualified sales management personnel penetrating the target market anticipating and ensuring compliance with regulatory developments and managing foreign operations in such locales 

risks inherent with making our products and services available in international markets include without limitation 

 

if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

we have acquired or invested in companies and technologies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate and execute potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies although we conduct reasonably extensive due diligence with each of the entities we engage for a strategic transaction our due diligence efforts may not reveal every material concern that may exist either with respect to the target entity or our assumptions surrounding the resulting combination these strategic transactions involve numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity or equitylinked securities to pay for any future acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or our stock price furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect our stock price the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to the operation of our business 

if we or our thirdparty service providers suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive data including personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and in some cases government information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss these measures may be breached because of employee error or thirdparty actions including unintentional events or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information in addition third parties have attempted and may continue to attempt to fraudulently induce employees contractors or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers’ data and we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets additionally because we do not control our thirdparty service providers or their processing of data we cannot ensure the integrity or security of measures they take to protect customer information and prevent data loss computer malware viruses hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and they have occurred on our and our thirdparty service providers’ systems in the past and may occur again on these systems in the future because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched against a target we have been and may continue to be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures however as cybersecurity threats develop and grow more complex over time it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure a security breach suffered by us or our thirdparty service providers an attack against our service availability or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation the triggering of service availability indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other significant costs and liabilities in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating remediating eliminating complying with notice obligations and implementing additional measures designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents we also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 

further in most instances our customers administer access to the data held in their particular instance for their employees and service providers we offer tools and support for what we believe are best practices to maintain security utilizing our services but customers are not required to utilize those tools or follow our suggested practices as a result or for other reasons a customer may suffer a cybersecurity event on its own systems unrelated to our own and allow a malicious actor to obtain access to the customer’s information held on our platform even if such a breach is unrelated to our security programs or practices such breach could result in our incurring significant economic and operational costs in investigating remediating eliminating and implementing additional measures to further protect our customers from their own vulnerabilities and could result in reputational harm to us 

  

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and many key individual contributors from time to time in the ordinary course of business there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example our current president and chief executive officer was appointed in november 2019 and our current chief financial officer was appointed in january 2020 while we seek to manage these transitions carefully including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and we may experience increased compensation and training costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highlyskilled employees with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london amsterdam and hyderabad our primary operating locations is intense many of our employees including all of our executive officers are employed “atwill” and may terminate their employment with us at any time if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

in addition we believe our corporate culture of fostering innovation teamwork and employee satisfaction has been a key contributor to our success to date as we continue to grow and expand globally we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics such as the recent spread of the coronavirus terrorism political unrest telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattacks geopolitical instability war the effects of climate change such as drought wildfires increased storm severity and sea level rise and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers may cause implementations of our products to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful 

our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers increasingly we and our customers rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand further our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers or other factors may cause implementations to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful for example changes in the functional requirements of our customers delays in timeline or deviations from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project as a result of these and other risks we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase implementation and enablement of our products some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers’ expectations which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented some customers may lack the employee talent or organizational capacity to manage a digital transformation such as our offering and as a consequence may be unable to see the benefits of our products unsuccessful lengthy or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers reputational harm and opportunities for competitors to displace our products each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future for example we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may result from errors we make in developing delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data centers operated by several different providers located around the world and we plan to serve certain of our customers using data center facilities operated by public cloud service providers these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence despite precautions taken at these centers problems at these centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers similarly customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency that we may not be able to or may not choose to meet the occurrence of payment delays service credit warranty or termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our service level credit accruals other increased expenses or risks of litigation we may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

risks related to the financial performance or financial position of our business 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors some of which are beyond our control for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our financial performance to vary widely or cause our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include 



 

lawsuits against us by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry many companies in our industry including our competitors other third parties and nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us 

moreover the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses from time to time our competitors or other third parties including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example we recorded charges for aggregate legal settlements of 2700 million in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended december 31 2016 the charges covered the fulfillment by us of all financial obligations under settlement agreements with bmc and hpe with no remaining financial obligations to bmc or hpe under either settlement 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue we may incur substantial attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages andor make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering our products and services modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us further upon expiration of the term of any thirdparty agreements that allow us to use their intellectual property we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all in which case we may face intellectual property litigation the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the courts press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers this could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors and cause a substantial decline in our stock price any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws including the fcpa and similar laws of other countries and general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargoes we could be subject to penalties and civil andor criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to the fcpa the us domestic bribery statute contained in 18 usc §201 the uk bribery act and possibly other antibribery laws in countries in which we conduct activities we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and thirdparty intermediaries from promising authorizing offering or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials political parties and privatesector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business directing business to any person or securing any advantage in addition we use various third parties to sell our products and services and conduct our business both in the us and abroad we or our thirdparty intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or stateowned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these thirdparty intermediaries our employees representatives contractors partners and agents even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities we have implemented and continue to update an anticorruption compliance program but there is a risk that our employees and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations could take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will inevitably do more business with large enterprises and the public sector in countries that are perceived to have heightened levels of public sector corruption increased business in countries perceived to have heightened levels of corruption could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from our business operations in addition we are subject to compliance with general trade regulations relating to doing business outside the us including certain restrictions on conducting trade in certain restricted countries or with certain entities or individuals 

any violation of the fcpa other anticorruption laws or general trade regulations by our employees or our thirdparty intermediaries could result in regulatory investigations whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage andor severe criminal or civil sanctions which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation business operating results and prospects in addition responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under patent and other intellectual property protections of the us and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents acquired in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer services the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the us and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights or available remedies may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have initiated and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into other products and services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products and services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our products and services we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our products and services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from distributing our products and services 

because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions net new annual contract value from new subscriptions and expansion contracts entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenues for the duration of the subscription term as a result most of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods consequently a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period in addition our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited 

further a decline in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that period but they will negatively affect our revenues in future periods accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under accounting standards update 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” depends on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period 

in addition a decrease in new subscriptions expansion contracts or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease such as an increase in billings duration the dollar value of contracts with future start dates or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

as our business grows we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our longerterm revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities which may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business you should not rely on our revenue for any prior periods as any indication of our future revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our stock price could be volatile 

changes in our effective tax rate or rejection of our tax position in jurisdictions outside the us could have a material impact on our financial position and results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law which could affect our results of operations in the period issued many countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period further many of our most important intangible assets are held outside the us and are subject to intercompany agreements regarding the development and distribution of those assets to other jurisdictions while we believe that our position is appropriate and well founded in the event that our position was to be successfully challenged by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions we may become subject to significant tax liabilities which could harm our financial position and financial results 

we may incur losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap during future periods 

although we have reported results that were profitable on a gaap basis for fullyear 2019 and certain prior quarters we have incurred net losses in all prior fiscal years since our inception even if our revenues continue to increase we may incur losses in accordance with gaap during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards business combinations and other expenses we may also encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs furthermore it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market customer demand for our products customer adoption and renewal rates and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products as a result of these and other factors we may not maintain profitability in the future and our gross margins and ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to increase our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our business operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the reasonable assurance level of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency 

risks related to general economic conditions 

global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us from time to time the us and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical and economic instability high levels of credit defaults international trade disputes falling demand for various goods and services high levels of persistent unemployment wage and income stagnation restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies international trade agreements trade restrictions and overall economic uncertainty these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

in 2020 for example the growth rate in the eu china or the us tariffs or trade relations between the us and china or other countries political uncertainty in the middle east and other geopolitical events could directly or indirectly affect our business additionally in connection with brexit the impact of the uk’s exit from the eu is still to be fully seen with the applicable trade agreement to be negotiated before december 2020 or a type of “nodeal” exit would occur this could be harmful to both the uk and eu economies and businesses operating there 

in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods in addition the announcement of brexit and the continued uncertainty around the full impact of it and the exact trade arrangements upon exit has adversely impacted global markets including currencies and resulted in a decline and volatility in the value of the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar and other currencies volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to a number of factors including uncertainty surrounding brexit trade arrangements and the recent political and economic uncertainty globally 

in 2018 we began using derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements further unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions moreover for a number of reasons including our limited experience with these hedging contracts we may not seek or be able to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and could expose us to a greater overall risk of loss than if we had not hedged 

risks related to our convertible senior notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes due 2022 the 2022 notes in cash or to repurchase the 2022 notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 notes 

holders of the 2022 notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the 2022 notes the indenture at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition if a makewhole fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2022 notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2022 notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change upon conversion of the 2022 notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the 2022 notes being converted 

we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the 2022 notes when due furthermore the indenture prohibits us from being acquired unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2022 notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the 2022 notes 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase the 2022 notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default a default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the business day immediately preceding february 1 2022 the holders of the 2022 notes may elect to convert their notes during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to  17518 the conversion condition the conversion condition for the 2022 notes was met for all quarters ended june 30 2018 through december 31 2019 except for the quarter ended december 31 2018 therefore our 2022 notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2020 except for the quarter ended march 31 2019 because the conversion condition for the 2022 notes was not met for the quarter ended december 31 2018 during the year ended december 31 2019 we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2022 notes based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately 25 million and 52 million in principal amount of the 2022 notes during the first and second quarters of 2020 respectively we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter of 2020 if more holders elect to convert their 2022 notes in future periods unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on early conversions of the 2022 notes converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date 

  

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the 2022 notes we entered into convertible note hedge the 2022 note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions option counterparties we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock the 2022 warrants the 2022 note hedge is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2022 notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2022 notes as applicable the 2022 warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to the extent that our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the 2022 warrants which is 20340 as the 2022 warrants will be net share settled the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2022 warrants which will be september 1 2022 we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants based on the volumeweighted average stock price on december 31 2019 the total number of shares of our common stock to be issued upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants would be approximately 16 million  the actual number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants if any is unknown at this time refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes or following any repurchase of the 2022 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indenture or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in our stock price or the 2022 notes price which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the 2022 notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on our stock price or the 2022 notes price will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 notes and the resulting amount of cash andor number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the 2022 notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2022 notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 note hedge 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the stock price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition technology companies in general have highly volatile stock prices and the volatility in stock price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting our stock price some of which are beyond our control include 

 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business this could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in our stock price 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangements any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law or our 2022 notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress our stock price 

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress our stock price by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change

overview 

  

servicenow’s purpose is to make the world of work work better for people we believe that people should work the way they want to so we build applications that help automate existing processes and create efficient digitized workflows our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments systems and processes of a business when work flows naturally great experiences follow we primarily deliver our software via the internet as a service through a simple and easytouse interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings and customers can easily build their custom applications in a minority of cases customers choose to host our software by themselves or through a thirdparty service provider 

we generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors including duration of subscription term volume mix of products purchased and discounts we sell our products as subscription services and primarily through direct sales we also offer professional services both directly and through partners to help our customers understand and utilize our products and platform more effectively we also generate revenues from certain professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel our professional services organization provides strategic advisory and consulting services to help customers maximize the value of their servicenow investment we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth 

key business metrics 

  

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 892  677  and 505 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate gult data universal numbering system duns number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity accordingly we restate previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million calculations to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million 

remaining performance obligations transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations rpo represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized which includes deferred revenue and noncancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods rpo excludes contracts that are billed in arrears such as certain time and materials contracts as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2019  our rpo was approximately 66 billion and we expect to recognize revenues on approximately 50 of these rpo over the following 12 months with the balance to be recognized thereafter factors that may cause our rpo to vary from period to period include the following 

 

   

   



successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date in other cases prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired 

  

 

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies the calculation of free cash flow is provided below 



 

billings we define billings a nongaap financial measure as gaap revenues recognized plus the change in total gaap unbilled receivables deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the calculation of billings is provided below 



 

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers renewal contracts expansion contracts contracts with new customers and contracts for professional services and training factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following 

 

 



 

while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business due to the factors described above an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings results we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented notwithstanding the adjustments described above the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals for which no adjustments have been presented 

foreign currency rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 677 million and a favorable impact of 310 million on billings for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of 12 million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

renewal rate we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period divided by the sum of i the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and ii the total acv from all customers lost during the period accordingly our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed further our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer or lapsed renewal for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability our renewal rate was 98 for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  and 97 for the year ended december 31 2017  as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful

comparison of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

revenues 



subscription revenues increased 8338 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count included in subscription revenues is 1641 million and 1185 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings during the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we expect subscription revenues for the year ending december 31 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products and increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended december 31 2019  our expectations for revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31 2020 are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2019  

subscription revenues consist of the following 



 

our digital workflow products include the now platform now it service management now it business management now devops now it asset management now security operations now integrated risk management now hr service delivery now finance operations management now customer service management and now field service management and are generally priced on a per user basis our itom products are generally priced on a per node physical or virtual server basis in previously issued consolidated financial statements we referred to digital workflow products as “service management products” 

professional services and other revenues increased 179 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to new and existing customers we expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending december 31 2020 to increase in absolute dollars but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 



cost of subscription revenues increased 1322 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 301 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 240 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 108 million in other overhead expenses the remaining increase of 617 million was primarily due to increases in data center hardware software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity amortization of intangibles increased 51 million as a result of current year acquisitions 

our subscription gross profit percentage was 83 for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the increase in revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings contributed to approximately one percentage point improvement in our subscription gross profit percentage for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances and our subscription gross profit percentage to remain relatively flat for the year ending december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019  to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 418 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 249 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 103 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 54 million in overhead expenses 

our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 20 during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 9 in the prior year primarily due to stockbased compensation and other personnelrelated costs increasing at a higher rate than professional services and other revenues as we continue to invest in specialized resources to support our expanding product portfolio and new ondemand training increasing the training content available online 

sales and marketing 



sales and marketing expenses increased 3312 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 1548 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation and commissions an increase of 404 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 371 million in overhead expenses expenses associated with commissions and thirdparty referral fees increased 262 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in contracts with new customers expansion and renewal contracts outside services costs increased 123 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions branding and marketing program expenses and costs associated with purchasing advertising and market data increased 569 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year 

we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december 31 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our direct sales organization increase our marketing activities grow our international operations and build brand awareness but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended december 31 2019  

research and development 



research and development expenses increased 2189 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of 1140 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 596 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 339 million in overhead expenses the remaining increase of 43 million was primarily due to increases in data center capacity and depreciation costs 

  we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december 31 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform and increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended december 31 2019  

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses increased 430 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of 363 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 74 million in overhead and other expenses amortization of intangibles increased 41 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year as a result of acquisitions outside services costs increased 107 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our administrative function these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation of 160 million  primarily attributable to the forfeiture of certain awards by our former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december 31 2020 as we continue to hire new employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues compared to december 31 2019  

  

stockbased compensation 



stockbased compensation expense increased 1182 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards 

stockbased compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2019  we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december 31 2020 as we continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended december 31 2019  

foreign currency exchange 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 34 of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound sterling from the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2019 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2019 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2018 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported subscription revenues would have been 576 million higher and our reported professional services and other revenues would have been 48 million higher  

in addition because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of sales and operating expenses outside of the united states the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2019 had a favorable impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2019 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2018 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported cost of subscription revenues cost of professional services and other revenues sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses would have been 80 million  40 million  191 million and 23 million higher  respectively the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2019 is not material to general and administrative expenses 

interest expense 



interest expense decreased 195 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year due to the repayments of the 2018 notes that occurred in 2018 for the year ending december 31 2020  we expect to incur approximately 350 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes 

interest income and other income expense net 



nm  not meaningful 

interest income and other income expense net increased 22 million during the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase of 208 million in interest income resulting from higher cash and investment balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 21 million in other due to an unrealized gain on nonmarketable securities relating to observable price changes and the absence of a 41 million loss recorded on early note conversions in the prior year 

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 193 million in realized gains relating to changes in the market value of our marketable equity securities held and sold in the prior year and a decrease of 72 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of the effect of our foreign currency derivative contracts 

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements 

  

benefit from income taxes 



  

nm  not meaningful 

our effective tax rate was 833 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 32 for the prior year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the irish deferred tax assets of 5742 million  see note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we maintained a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively in addition we maintained a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2018  the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



 

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of both the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by december 31 and the large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures as a result our billings and sequential growth in rpo has been historically highest in the quarter ended december 31 while we continue to see an increase in the number of agreements entered into with the us federal government throughout the year as it modernizes its it infrastructure and accelerates its use of modern technology to digitally transform how it operates the number of agreements entered into with the us federal government has historically been higher in the quarter ended september 30 driven primarily by timing of annual budget expenditures furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of our customer agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloudoffering contracts with a future start date from our billings unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented due to increases in headcount data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference partially offset by related proceeds marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements including the timing of capital expenditures we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended march 31 and september 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans in the quarter ended march 31 purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in both quarters ended march 31 and september 30 and payouts under our bonus plans in both quarters ended march 31 and september 30 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2019  we had 17 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 2028 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries and 1922 million is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition we had  10 billion in longterm investments that provide additional capital resources we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 

prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states subsequent to the enactment of the tax act we determined that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested except in certain designated jurisdictions in which the resident entity is a service provider which is not expected to generate substantial amounts of cash in excess of what may be reinvested by the local entity 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price of the 2022 notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30 2018 through december 31 2019 except for the quarter ended december 31 2018 therefore our 2022 notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2020 except for the quarter ended march 31 2019 because the conversion condition for the 2022 notes was not met for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the impact of the 2022 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 notes in cash during the year ended december 31 2019 we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2022 notes based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately 25 million and 52 million in principal amount of the 2022 notes during the first and second quarters of 2020 respectively we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter of 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we issued approximately 43 million shares of our common stock upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 warrants the 2018 warrants were no longer outstanding as of the second quarter of 2019 we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants as the 2022 warrants will be net share settled there will be no impact on our liquidity the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2022 warrants which will be september 1 2022 refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the repayment of our 2022 notes expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of property and equipment intangibles and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions andor debt retirements if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net income loss adjusted for repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred commissions amortization of issuance cost and debt discount stockbased compensation deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 8111 million for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount that were made during the year ended december 31 2018 and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from the change in net income loss adjusted for noncash items to reconcile net income loss to net cash provided by operations offset by the unfavorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 7245 million compared to 3474 million for the prior year the increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a 3418 million increase in net purchases of investments a 483 million increase in purchases of other intangibles and a 404 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a 300 million decrease in cash outflow for business combinations net of cash and restricted cash acquired and a 234 million increase in net realized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 3019 million compared to 6074 million for the prior year due to repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to principal of 4296 million during the year ended december 31 2018 a 37 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans and partially offset by a 1287 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table represents our future noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  aggregated by type 



 

in addition to the obligations in the table above 61 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2019  it is uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we report our revenues in two categories i subscriptions and ii professional services and other 

revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services 

we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

 

subscription revenues 

subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term for our cloud services we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally noncancelable and without any refundtype provisions we typically invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date 

subscription revenues also include revenues from selfhosted offerings in which customers deploy or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software for these contracts we account for the software element and the related support and updates separately as they are distinct performance obligations refer to the discussion below related to contracts with multiple performance obligations for further details the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis the transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term 

professional services and other revenues 

our professional services arrangements are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered other revenues consist of fees from customer training delivered onsite or through publicly available classes typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice 

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations for these contracts the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment 

deferred commissions 

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third parties capitalized sales commissions also include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with payments to our sales employees to the extent they are incremental commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term additionally for selfhosted offerings consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for selfhosted offerings a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the selfhosted offering is made available the determination of the period of benefit requires significant judgment by taking into consideration our customer contracts our technology life cycle and other factors we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

  

business combinations 

we apply a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination if the screen test is not met the integrated set of activities and assets is considered a business based on whether there are inputs and substantive processes in place the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included but are not limited to cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future discount rates the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units rsus with only service conditions on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the fouryear vesting term for stock options and rsus granted with both service conditions and performance or market conditions the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period and for awards with performance conditions when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp on a straightline basis over the sixmonth offering period we estimate the fair value of stock option grants with only service conditions and shares issued pursuant to the espp using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards including performancebased rsus using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence we have determined that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31 2019  we recognized an income tax benefit of 5742 million due to the release of the valuation allowance on the irish deferred tax assets for the year ended december 31 2019  these irish deferred tax assets were created primarily as a result of the difference between the tax basis in our irish subsidiary and the cost reported in our consolidated financial statements resulting from the transfer of intangible assets to the irish subsidiary as part of our foreign restructuring in 2018  management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future in determining the need or continued need for a valuation allowance we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes among other things emergence from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years during the fourth quarter of 2019  historical earnings future growth forecasted earnings and future taxable income 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

new accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

the impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in note 2  summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 




 



foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and british pound sterling and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar relative to these currencies and conversely are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these currencies revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71 during each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  and 73 during the year ended december 31 2017  

  

to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended december 31 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded 

a hypothetical 10 increase in the us dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of approximately 306 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and an increase in operating loss of approximately 234 million and 153 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

these derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty while the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes refer to note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 27 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments as of december 31 2019  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds certificates of deposit corporate notes and bonds government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poor’s baa2 by moody’s or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 143 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2018  we had an aggregate of 21 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 92 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because these instruments do not bear interest we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 notes associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of our 2022 notes is exposed to interest rate risks generally the fair market value of our 2022 notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise in addition the fair value of the notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature and will generally increase as the stock price increases 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had 224 million and 146 million  respectively of equity investment in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value in addition upon adoption of asu 201601 as of january 1 2018 we are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as a result we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss in future periods due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities these changes could be material based on market conditions and events

acquisitions and investments 

  

in addition to continuing to invest in our own research and development efforts we have made acquisitions and investments in the past and will continue to assess opportunities for strategic acquisitions and investments to complement our technology and skill sets and expand our product reach we are focused on building out our platform and products through both acquisitions and investments that will satisfy growing customer needs 

competition 

  

the markets for our solutions generally are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

• large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors 

• solutions developed inhouse by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools 

• large integrated systems vendors 

• infrastructureasaservice and platformasaservice providers 

• established and emerging cloud vendors and 

• vendors of products and services for development operations 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud solution accordingly we compete with both cloudbased and traditional enterprise application software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered as we continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it we expect increasing competition from platform and application development vendors focused on these other markets 

various factors influence purchase decisions in our industry including total cost of ownership level of customer satisfaction breadth and depth of product functionality security adherence to industry standards brand awareness flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services acquisitions integrations and consolidation by and among other companies in our industry may allow potential competitors to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages which may impact our competitive position in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors also have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings which may enable them to offer such products and services at a lower price as part of a larger sale as competition intensifies we expect pricing competition to continue or increase 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property ip rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services 

we continue to grow our patent portfolio and ip rights around the world that relate to our platform applications services research and development and other activities and our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip we have over 600 us and foreign patents including patents acquired from third parties and over 500 pending patent applications we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other ip right or groups of related patents or ip rights we file patent applications to protect our ip and have in the past and may in the future acquire additional patents patent portfolios or patent applications however we cannot be certain that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of value or applicability in addition any patents that have been or may be issued or acquired may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our solutions policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from utilizing their developments to compete with us reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our customers in addition based on our greater visibility expanding solutions footprint and market exposure as a public company we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties for example in 2016 we settled two patentrelated litigation matters and recorded a onetime charge of 2700 million related to aggregate legal settlements see “risk factors–claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2018  we had 8154 fulltime employees worldwide including 1835 in cloud operations professional services training and customer support 3061 in sales and marketing 2080 in research and development and 1178 in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries are represented by workers’ councils and also have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we consider our relations with our employees to be very good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements

risk factors 

tableend

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market we expect competition to intensify our current competitors include 

• large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors 

• solutions developed inhouse by our potential customers or using integrations with other tools 

• large integrated systems vendors 

• infrastructureasaservice and platformasaservice providers 

• established and emerging cloud vendors and 

• vendors of products and services for development operations 

many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to our enterprise cloud solutions many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services acquisitions integrations and consolidation by and among other companies in our industry may allow potential competitors to offer integrated or bundled products enhanced functionality or other advantages which may impact our competitive position we have expanded the breadth of our services to include offerings in the markets for it operations management customer service management security operations management hr service delivery and use of our platform by developers of custom applications as a result we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards customer requirements and buying practices in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions we expect that smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressures including in the it service management market which is our more mature offering and from which we derive the substantial majority of our revenues for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological market and customer developments our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

the markets in which we compete continue to evolve rapidly and the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as public and private cloud solutions and infrastructure massively scalable databases mobile workflow consumer productlike user experiences social collaboration machine learning artificial intelligence internet connected devices robotic automation security cryptography development tools and other digital technologies increasingly become the basis for customer purchases at the same time our customers and prospective customers are either facing their own competitive imperatives to adopt digital technologies or have been built on fully digital modern it technologies resulting in the ongoing disruption of almost every sector of the global economy acquisitions integrations and consolidation by and among companies in our industry may further accelerate changes in the markets in which we participate accordingly to compete effectively in our rapidly changing markets we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies among the many in which we could make investments knowing that we cannot make substantial investments in all of them accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs and priorities including their technology infrastructures and buying practices successfully deliver new platform and database technologies and products that scale to meet these needs and priorities efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments profitably market and sell products to companies in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience including to fully digital companies built on modern it technologies that have historically not been strong buyers of itsm and itom products like ours and effectively deliver either directly or through our ecosystem of partners the business process planning it systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful if we fail to meet any of these requirements our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us from time to time the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical and economic instability high levels of credit defaults globally international trade disputes falling demand for a variety of goods and services high levels of persistent unemployment and wage and income stagnation in some geographic markets restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies international trade agreements trade restrictions and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results in 2019 for example the growth rate in the economy of the eu china or the us trade relations between the us and china political uncertainty in the middle east and other geopolitical events could directly or indirectly affect our business additionally in connection with the june 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the eu brexit the united kingdom the uk and the eu announced in march 2018 an agreement in principle to transitional provisions under which eu law would remain in force in the uk until the end of december 2020 but this remains subject to the successful conclusion of a final withdrawal agreement between the parties in the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a “hard” exit of britain from the european union hard brexit would occur on march 29 2019 although the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu are still unknown it is possible that there will be a serious disruption of the eu financial services leading to global economic consequences and increased regulatory and legal complexities including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the uk and the eu the uk’s exit from the eu may also cause disruption or create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees and resulting in increased costs or operational challenges 

in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we or our thirdparty service providers suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive data including personally identifiable information protected health information financial information and in some cases government information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss these measures may be breached as a result of employee error or thirdparty actions including unintentional events or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees contractors or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers’ data and we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets additionally because we do not control our thirdparty service providers or the processing of data by our thirdparty service providers we cannot ensure the integrity or security of measures they take to protect customer information and prevent data loss moreover computer malware viruses and hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and have occurred on our and our thirdparty service providers’ systems in the past and may occur on these systems in the future because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures however as cybersecurity threats develop evolve and grow more complex over time it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure a security breach suffered by us or our thirdparty service providers an attack against our service availability or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation the triggering of service availability indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other significant costs and liabilities in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating remediating eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents we also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 

further in most instances our customers administer access to the data held in their particular instance for their own employees and service providers we offer tools and support for what we believe are best practices to maintain security utilizing our services but customers are not required to utilize those tools or follow our suggested practices as a result or for other reasons a customer may suffer a cybersecurity event on its own systems unrelated to our own and as a result of that event a malicious actor could obtain access to the customer’s information held on our platform even if such a breach is unrelated to our own security programs or practices that breach could result in our incurring significant economic and operational costs in investigating remediating eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices to further protect our customers from their own vulnerabilities and could also result in reputational harm to us 

as our business grows we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our longerterm revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our stock price could be volatile 

we may continue to incur losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap during future periods 

although we have recent reported quarterly results that were profitable on a gaap basis we have incurred net losses in all fiscal years since our inception even if our revenues continue to increase we may incur losses in accordance with gaap during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards business combinations and other expenses additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unforeseen or unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs furthermore it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market customer demand for our products customer adoption and renewal rates and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products as a result of these and other factors we may not maintain profitability in the future our gross margins and ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to increase our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our business operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected 

delays in the release of or actual or perceived defects in new or updated products may slow the adoption of our most recent technologies reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services decrease customer satisfaction increase our vulnerability to cyber attacks and adversely impact sales of additional products to our customers 

we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products the success of any release depends on a number of factors including our ability to manage the risks associated with quality or other defects or deficiencies delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introduction if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are otherwise difficult to implement customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted customer satisfaction may decrease our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced and our growth prospects may be harmed 

various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers may cause implementations of our products to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful 

our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers increasingly we as well as our customers rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand further various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us our partners or our customers may cause implementations to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful for example changes in the functional requirements of our customers delays in timeline or deviation from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project as a result of these and other risks we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase implementation and enablement of our products some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers’ expectations which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented unsuccessful lengthy or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers harm to our reputation and opportunities for competitors to displace our products each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future for example we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their own businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors some of which are beyond our control for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to vary widely or cause our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include 



 

changes in our effective tax rate could impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in us federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings the us enacted significant tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law which could affect our results of operations in the period issued many countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period 

our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap which are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future which may have a significant effect on our financial results for example in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which became effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2018 refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on topic 606 and its impact on us if modifications to our accounting systems and internal controls implemented for the adoption of new accounting principles such as topic 606 are insufficient our financial position and operating results could be adversely affected 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods in addition the announcement of brexit adversely impacted global markets including currencies and resulted in a decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to a number of factors including uncertainty surrounding brexit and the recent political and economic uncertainty globally 

in 2018 we began using derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements further unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions moreover for a number of reasons including our limited experience with these hedging contracts we may not seek or be able to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and could and expose us to a greater overall risk of loss than had we not undertaken the hedging strategy 

lawsuits against us by thirdparties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry many companies in our industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us 

moreover the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses from time to time our competitors or other third parties including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example we recorded charges for aggregate legal settlements of 2700 million in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended december 31 2016 the charge covers the fulfillment by us of all financial obligations under settlement agreements with bmc and hpe with no remaining financial obligations to bmc or hpe under either settlement 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue we may incur substantial attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages andor make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering our products and services modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us further upon expiration of the term of any thirdparty agreements that allow us to use their intellectual property we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all in which case we may face intellectual property litigation the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the courts press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers and could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors in our common stock and could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock accordingly any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under a combination of patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents acquired in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have initiated and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented approximately 34 and 33 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and will subject us to regulatory political and economic risks that are different from those in the united states we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers a factor effecting our growth has generally been lower in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established and where there may be increased operational and intellectual property risks as compared to north america australia and areas within western europe an increasing proportion of the large enterprises that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including in hiring qualified sales management personnel penetrating the target market andor managing foreign operations in such locales 

risks inherent with international sales include without limitation 



if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we do business with federal state and local governments government agencies and heavily regulated organizations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions as a result we face risks related to the procurement process budget decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations termination of contracts and compliance with government contracting requirements 

we provide products and services to the us government by leveraging our partner ecosystem and to a number of state and local governments and heavilyregulated organizations both through our partners and directly and we have made and may continue to make significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the federal state and local government sectors a substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks among other risks the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive and can be timeconsuming requiring us to incur significant upfront time and expense such as engaging lobbyists which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs without any assurance that we or a thirdparty reseller will win a contract beyond this demand for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability funding in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown which could adversely impact demand for our products and services in addition public sector and heavilyregulated customers may have contractual statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our thirdparty distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default though such risk may be assumed by such thirdparty distributor or reseller if a contract is terminated for convenience we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses if a contract is terminated due to a default we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities further entities providing services to governments are required to comply with a variety of complex laws regulations and contractual provisions relating to the formation administration or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts these may include rights with respect to price protection the accuracy of information provided to the government contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies and other terms that are particular to government contracts such as termination rights these rules may apply to us andor third parties through whom we resell our products and services and whose practices we may not control where such parties’ noncompliance could impose repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues federal state and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements if as a result of an audit or review it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business and we may suffer harm to our reputation 

our customers also include a number of nonus governments similar procurement budgetary contract and audit risks that apply in the context of us government contracting also apply to our doing business with these entities particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established in addition compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources in certain jurisdictions our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws including the fcpa and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the united states as well as general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargoes we could be subject to penalties our business could be materially adversely affected and we could be subject to civil andor criminal sanctions 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended fcpa the us domestic bribery statute contained in 18 usc §201 the uk bribery act and possibly other antibribery laws in countries in which we conduct activities we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and thirdparty intermediaries from promising authorizing offering or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials political parties and privatesector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business directing business to any person or securing any advantage in addition we use various third parties to sell our solution and conduct our business abroad we or our thirdparty intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or stateowned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these thirdparty intermediaries our employees representatives contractors partners and agents even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities we have implemented and continue to update an anticorruption compliance program but cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will inevitably do more business with large enterprises and the public sector in countries that are perceived to have heightened levels of public sector corruption increased business in countries perceived to have heightened levels of corruption could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from our business operations 

in addition we are subject to compliance with general trade regulations relating to doing business outside the united states including certain restrictions on conducting trade in certain restricted countries or with certain entities or individuals 

any violation of the fcpa other applicable anticorruption laws general trade regulations by our own employees or our thirdparty intermediaries could result in regulatory investigations whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage andor severe criminal or civil sanctions which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation business operating results and prospects in addition responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team including our chief executive officer and many key individual contributors from time to time in the ordinary course of business there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives while we seek to manage these transitions carefully including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london amsterdam and hyderabad our primary operating locations is intense our employees including our executive officers are employed by us on an “atwill” basis which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to personal data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

national and local governments or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data changing laws regulations and standards applying to the collection transfer processing storage or use of personal data could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services and in some cases could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally for example in 2016 the eu adopted the gdpr which took effect on may 25 2018 and established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data in the united kingdom a data protection bill that substantially implements the gdpr also became law in may 2018 further laws such as the eu’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes the tracking of individuals’ online activities and the “right to be forgotten” requiring a company to delete certain information about individuals upon their request in certain circumstances although we do not believe brexit will require us to alter our operations in any material way brexit may cause uncertainty for our customers in addition in june 2018 the ccpa was signed into law which takes effect in july 2020 and broadly defines personal information and provides california consumers increased privacy rights and protections the ccpa will among other things require covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information when it goes into effect on july 1 2020 legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the ccpa before it goes into effect and it remains unclear what if any modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted the effects of the ccpa potentially are significant however and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply 

  

the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by the gdpr the eprivacy regulation the ccpa and other privacy laws regulations and standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services in addition noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others significant fines and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and other technology and industry groups have established or may establish various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could reduce demand for our applications and adversely affect our business 

because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions net new acv from new subscriptions expansion contracts and renewals entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenue for the duration of the subscription term as a result most of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods consequently a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period in addition our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited 

further a decline in new subscriptions or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that period but will negatively affect our revenues in future periods accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under topic 606 will depend on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period 

in addition a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease such as an increase in billings duration the dollar value of contracts with future start dates or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

we rely on our network of partners for a portion of our revenues and if these partners fail to perform our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited and our operating results may be harmed 

a portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners including distributors and resellers in addition we increasingly rely on our partners to provide professional services including customer implementations while we provide our partners with training and programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may take significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our corporate policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain these partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results may be harmed 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

we have acquired or invested in companies and technologies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate and from time to time execute potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies although we conduct a reasonably extensive due diligence with each of the entities with which we engage for a potential strategic transaction our due diligence efforts may not reveal every material concern that may exist either with respect to the target entity or our assumptions surrounding the resulting combination acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity or equitylinked securities to pay for any future acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses new accounting principles such as the new revenue recognition standards that became effective for us beginning january 1 2018 require significant changes to our existing processes and controls we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics terrorism political unrest telecommunications failure vandalism cyberattacks geopolitical instability war the effects of climate change such as drought wildfires increased storm severity and sea level rise and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

risks related to our convertible senior notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes due 2022 the 2022 notes in cash or to repurchase the 2022 notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 notes 

holders of the 2022 notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the 2022 notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition if a makewhole fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the 2022 notes occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2022 notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2022 notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change upon conversion of the 2022 notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the 2022 notes being converted 

we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the 2022 notes when due furthermore the indenture for the 2022 notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2022 notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the 2022 notes 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase the 2022 notes at a time when the repurchase is required by each indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the business day immediately preceding february 1 2022 the holders of the 2022 notes may elect to convert their notes during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to  17518 the conversion condition the conversion condition was met for the 2022 notes during the three months ended june 30 2018 and september 30 2018 therefore the 2022 notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 and continued to be convertible at the holders’ option through december 31 2018 the conversion condition was not met for the 2022 notes for the three months ended december 31 2018 and therefore the 2022 notes are not convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending march 31 2019 if one or more holders elect to convert their 2022 notes in future periods unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on early conversions of the 2022 notes converted by noteholders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the 2022 notes and our convertible senior notes due 2018 the 2018 notes we entered into convertible note hedge the 2022 note hedge and 2018 note hedge respectively transactions with certain financial institutions option counterparties we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock the 2022 warrants and 2018 warrants respectively the 2018 note hedge offset the dilution and cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the converted 2018 notes and expired upon the maturity date of the 2018 notes which was november 1 2018 the 2022 note hedge is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2022 notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2022 notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the 2022 warrants or 2018 warrants which is 20340 and 10746 respectively as the 2018 warrants and the 2022 warrants will be net share settled the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2018 warrants which is was february 1 2019 and the first expiration date of the 2022 warrants which will be september 1 2022 we have issued and expect to continue to issue additional shares of our common stock in the first half of 2019 upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 warrants additionally we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants based on the volumeweighted average stock price on february 1 2019 the total number of shares of our common stock to be issued upon the exercise of the 2018 warrants would be approximately 40 million  resulting in immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders similarly the 2022 warrants could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on september 1 2022 exceeds the strike price of the 2022 warrants based on the volumeweighted average stock price on february 1 2019 the total number of shares of our common stock to be issued upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants would be approximately 04 million  the actual number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants if any is unknown at this time refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes or following any repurchase of the 2022 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indentures for the 2022 notes or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2022 notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the 2022 notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 2022 notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any 2022 notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the 2022 notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2022 notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 note hedge 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock some of which are beyond our control include 

 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business this could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law our 2022 notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change

overview 

  

servicenow the company that makes work work better for people is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services that define structure manage and automate digital workflows for global enterprises we deliver digital workflows that help our customers create great experiences and unlock productivity we typically deliver our software via the internet as a service through an easytouse consumer productlike interface which means it can be easily configured and rapidly deployed in a minority of cases customers deploy our software internally or contract with a third party to host the software to support their unique regulatory or security requirements 

we generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors including duration of subscription term volume mix of products purchased and discounts we generate sales through our direct sales team and to a lesser extent indirectly through resale partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 8154 as of december 31 2018 from 6222 as of december 31 2017  

key business metrics 

  

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 678  508  and 354 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate gult data universal numbering system duns number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million 

renewal rate we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period divided by the sum of i the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and ii the total acv from all customers lost during the period accordingly our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed further our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability our renewal rate was 98  for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2016  and 97 for the year ended december 31 2017  as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful 

total backlog total backlog consists of unbilled backlog deferred revenue and customer deposits unbilled backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm that are to be invoiced under our existing agreements and are not included in the deferred revenue or customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets in our previous annual reports on form 10k we referred to unbilled backlog as “backlog” we believe total backlog is a useful measure of customer adoption of our services 

as of december 31 2018  our total backlog was 51 billion  of which 34 billion was unbilled backlog and 17 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits of this total backlog we expect to recognize approximately 50 in revenues over the 12 months following december 31 2018  with the balance to be recognized thereafter 

as of december 31 2017  our total backlog was 38 billion  of which 25 billion was unbilled backlog and 17 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits which reflects the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606 for the disclosure of unbilled backlog prior to the adoption of topic 606 see the section entitled “business” in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 filed on february 28 2018 

we expect total backlog to fluctuate due to a number of factors including the timing duration and size of customer contracts the mix of cloud and selfhosted offerings and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

billings we define billings a nongaap financial measure as revenues recognized plus the change in total unbilled receivables deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows prior to adopting topic 606 on january 1 2018 we had defined billings in previous filings as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows our current definition better aligns with topic 606 which became effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2018 refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding topic 606 

a calculation of billings is provided below 



as adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606 see note 2 for further details 

nm  not meaningful yearoveryear percentage change in total billings is not meaningful as 2015 billings have not been adjusted for the adoption of topic 606 

 

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers renewal contracts contracts for increased purchases with existing customers expansion contracts contracts with new customers and contracts for professional services and training factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following 

 

 

 

 

while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business due to the factors described above an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings results we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented notwithstanding the adjustments described above the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals for which no adjustments have been presented 

foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of 310 million and 91 million on billings for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of 74 million and 16 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 



as adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606 see note 2 for further details 

 

average contract term we calculate the average contract term for new customers expansion contracts and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv revised mapping of customers in the current period may result in revised new customer expansion and renewal contract terms for previous periods due to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs improved subsidiary mapping consolidations and updates to customer duns numbers previously disclosed average contract terms may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability the average new customer contract term was 35 months 32 months and 31 months for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  the average expansion contract term was 25 months for the year ended december 31 2018 and 26 months for each of the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively the average renewal contract term was 27 months for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 and 28 months for the year ended december 31 2016  

g2k customer count the global 2000 g2k customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period our g2k customer count was 883  810  and 721 as of december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics sales profit assets and market value the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes we also adjust the g2k count for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity for example we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company or any of its related subsidiaries or any combination of entities within a g2k company we count only one g2k customer we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering which is our entrylevel it service management solution our g2k customer count does not include large private companies government agencies and educational organizations which represent a growing portion of our customer base as a result our g2k customer count metric has become less relevant to our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings 

average acv per g2k customer we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking aggregate acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of g2k customers as of the end of the period our average acv per g2k customer was approximately 17 million  13 million  and 11 million as of december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into and as a result foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer prior g2k customer counts used in calculating acv per g2k customer are adjusted for the most recent forbes global 2000 list for comparability purposes as discussed above average acv per g2k customer has become less relevant to our business over time as the underlying g2k customer count does not include large private companies government agencies and education organizations which represent a growing portion of our customer base as a result we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings

subscription revenues increased 6818 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count included in subscription revenues is 1185 million and 802 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings during the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively we expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues in the year ending december 31 2019  our expectations for revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31 2019 are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2018

professional services and other revenues increased 85 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to new and existing customers we expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending december 31 2019 to increase in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 



as adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606 see note 2 for further details 

  

cost of subscription revenues increased 1019 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 314 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 134 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 92 million in other overhead expenses depreciation expense increased 227 million due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and expenses associated with software and it services and technical support increased   103 million  in addition data center capacity costs increased 63 million due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers amortization of intangibles increased 41 million as a result of acquisitions and outside service costs increased   31 million due to an increase in contractors to support our customer contracts 

our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 83 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 82 for the year ended december 31 2017  due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale the increase in revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with selfhosted offerings contributed to approximately one percentage point improvement in our subscription gross profit percentage for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ending december 31 2019 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 209 million during the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 173 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 54 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 30 million in overhead expenses partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs of 44 million  primarily due to a decrease in professional services performed by contracted thirdparty partners 

our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 9 during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 3 in the prior year primarily due to stockbased compensation and other personnelrelated costs increasing at a higher rate than professional services and other revenues as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products

stockbased compensation expense increased 1499 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards 

stockbased compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2018  we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending december 31 2019 as we continue to issue stockbased awards to our employees but decrease as a percentage of total revenues 

foreign currency exchange 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 34 and 33 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound sterling from the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2018 had a favorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported subscription revenues would have been 275 million lower and our reported professional services and other revenues would have been 22 million lower  

in addition because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of sales and operating expenses outside of the united states the general weakening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2018 had an unfavorable impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported sales and marketing expenses would have been 46 million lower  the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2018 is not material to cost of revenues research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 

interest expense 



interest expense decreased 07 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year due to the early conversions and maturity of the 2018 notes offset by the increase in the aggregate amount of convertible debt and associated amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes for the year ending december 31 2019  we expect to incur approximately 333 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes

nm  not meaningful 

interest income and other income expense net increased 518 million during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the prior year primarily due to 193 million of realized gains relating to changes in the market value of our marketable equity securities refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details interest income and other income expense net also increased 192 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of the effect of our foreign currency derivative contracts and interest income increased 175 million due to higher cash and investment balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31 2018  partially offset by a 41 million loss recorded on early note conversions 

in order to manage certain exposures to currency fluctuations we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended december 31 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements

nm  not meaningful 

our effective tax rate was 32 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 3 for the prior year ended december 31 2017  we had a benefit from income taxes of 123 million for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to a provision for income taxes of 34 million for the prior year primarily due to the onetime indirect tax benefit of topic 606 on income taxes associated with intercompany adjustments offset by the increase in current cash taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions see note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures in addition the number of agreements entered into with the us federal government has historically been higher in the third quarter of each year driven primarily by timing of annual budget expenditures furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloudoffering contracts with a future start date from our billings similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference partially offset by related proceeds marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements including the timing of capital expenditures we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarter ended march 31 primarily due to payouts under the preceding year’s annual commission plans and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and expect to continue to see higher disbursements in the quarter ended march 31 as we start our 401k match program in the quarter ending march 31 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2018  we had 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 2539 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries 2499 million of the 15 billion is denominated in currencies other than us dollar in addition we had  5819 million in longterm investments that provide additional capital resources we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 

prior to the enactment of the tax act we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states subsequent to the enactment of the tax act we determined that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested except in certain designated jurisdictions in which the resident entity is a service provider which is not expected to generate substantial amounts of cash in excess of what may be reinvested by the local entity 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price of the 2022 notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30 2018 and september 30 2018 therefore the 2022 notes were convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2018 through december 31 2018 the 2022 notes are not convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending march 31 2019 the impact of the 2022 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 notes in cash we have not received any conversion requests for our 2022 notes 

in november 2013 we issued the 2018 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we settled 4132 million principal amount of the 2018 notes in early conversions and the remaining principal amount was settled on november 1 2018 the maturity date of our 2018 notes the conversion value over the principal amount for the early 2018 note conversions was settled in cash from the exercise of the 2018 note hedges the conversion value over the principal amount for the principal amount settled on november 1 2018 was satisfied with approximately 13 million shares of our common stock which was entirely offset by shares of our common stock delivered to us by the 2018 note hedge counterparties under the 2018 note hedge and cash in lieu of fractional shares the shares delivered to us by the 2018 note hedge counterparties were immediately retired as a result of the early note conversions we recorded a loss of 41 million for the year ended december 31 2018  as a result of the settlement of the 2018 notes and the 2018 note hedges we recorded an aggregate 64 million net reduction to additional paidin capital reflecting 7733 million of fair value adjustments to the conversion option settled offset by a 7669 million benefit from the exercise of the 2018 note hedges the 2018 notes and 2018 note hedge are no longer outstanding and the portion of the 2018 warrants that have not yet been automatically exercised remain outstanding as of the date of this filing 

we have issued and expect to continue to issue additional shares of our common stock in the first half of 2019 upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 warrants additionally we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants as the 2018 warrants and the 2022 warrants will be net share settled the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volumeweighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2018 warrants which was february 1 2019 and the first expiration date of the 2022 warrants which will be september 1 2022 because exercises of the 2018 warrants and the 2022 warrants will be net share settled there will not be an impact on our liquidity refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the repayment of our 2022 notes expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets intangibles and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions andor debt retirements if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing

net cash provided by operating activities was 8111 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 6429 million for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of 901 million  the remaining change was due to an increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6429 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 1591 million for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to 2675 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31 2016 refer to note 18 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details the remaining change was due to an increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2017 was 5389 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 558 million for the prior year the change was primarily due to a 6982 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 notes and the 2022 note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions entered into during the year ended december 31 2017 and a 162 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans partially offset by a 620 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a 550 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table represents our future noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  aggregated by type 



 

in addition to the obligations in the table above 47 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2018  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we report our revenues in two categories i subscriptions and ii professional services and other 

revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services 

we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

 

subscription revenues 

subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term for our cloud services we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally noncancelable and without any refundtype provisions we typically invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date 

subscription revenues also include revenues from selfhosted offerings in which customers deploy or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software for these contracts we account for the software element and the related support and updates separately as they are distinct performance obligations refer to the discussion below related to contracts with multiple performance obligations for further details the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized upon delivery which is when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term 

professional services and other revenues 

our professional services arrangements are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered we typically invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis under which we recognize revenues on a proportional performance basis or ratably over the contract term in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met other revenues consist of fees from customer training delivered onsite or through publicly available classes 

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations for these contracts the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts to ensure appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment significant judgment is also involved in determining ssp by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to competitive pricing of similar products other software vendor pricing industry publications and current pricing practices 

deferred commissions 

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties capitalized sales commissions also include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with payments to our sales employees to the extent they are incremental commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term additionally for selfhosted offerings consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for selfhosted offerings a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the selfhosted offering is made available the determination of the period of benefit requires significant judgment by taking into consideration our customer contracts our technology life cycle and other factors we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss

the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included but are not limited to cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future discount rates the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill in our single reporting unit for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable we periodically review the carrying amounts of longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill and longlived assets during the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit and asset group 

screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred including market conditions operating fundamentals competition and general economic conditions requires significant judgment additionally changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly to the extent an impairment indicator exists the measurement of the impairment charge requires significant judgment and could result in a material charge to operating expenses 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units rsus with only a service condition on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years for rsus granted with both service condition and a performance condition the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of generally three years after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp on a straightline basis over the sixmonth offering period we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence we have determined that it is more likely than not that our us and certain foreign deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31 2018  to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available we may release a portion or all of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods a release of the valuation allowance if any would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and british pound sterling and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar relative to these currencies and conversely are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these currencies revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71 during the year ended december 31 2018 and 73 during each of the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  

  

in order to manage certain exposures to currency fluctuations we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended december 31 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities these derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded 

a hypothetical 10 increase in the us dollar against other currencies would have resulted in an increase in operating loss of approximately 234 million  153 million and 81 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

these derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty while the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes refer to note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2018  we had 156 million invested primarily in preferred stock of privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value

acquisitions and investments 

  

in addition to continuing to invest in our own research and development efforts we have made acquisitions and investments in the past and will continue to assess opportunities for strategic acquisitions and investments to complement our technology and skill sets and expand our product reach we are focused on building out the core capabilities of our platform through both acquisitions and investments that will satisfy growing customer needs 

competition 

  

the markets for our solutions generally are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the markets in which we operate continue to mature we expect competition to intensify we compete primarily with large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors established and emerging cloud vendors and vendors of products and services for development operations many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud solution accordingly we compete with both enterprise application software vendors that provide onpremises software and with vendors providing cloudbased services our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered as we continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it we expect increasing competition from platform and application development vendors focused on these other markets 

various factors influence purchase decisions in our industry including total cost of ownership level of customer satisfaction breadth and depth of product functionality security adherence to industry standards brand awareness flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors also have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings which may enable them to offer such products and services at a lower price as part of a larger sale as competition intensifies we expect pricing competition to continue or increase 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property ip rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services 

we continue to grow our patent portfolio and ip rights around the world that relate to our platform applications services research and development and other activities and our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip we have over 350 us and foreign patents including patents acquired from third parties and over 250 pending patent applications we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or other ip right or groups of related patents or ip rights we file patent applications to protect our ip and have in the past and may in the future acquire additional patents patent portfolios or patent applications however we cannot be certain that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of value or applicability in addition any patents that have been or may be issued or acquired may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our solutions policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our industry is characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our customers in addition based on our greater visibility expanding solutions footprint and market exposure as a public company we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties for example in 2016 we settled two patentrelated litigation matters and recorded a onetime charge of 2700 million  related to aggregate legal settlements see “risk factors–claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2017  we had 6222  fulltime employees worldwide including 1498  in cloud operations professional services training and customer support 2413  in sales and marketing 1419  in research and development and 892  in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries are represented by workers councils and also have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we consider our relations with our employees to be very good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline and we may continue to incur losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business even if our revenues continue to increase we expect to continue to incur a loss in accordance with gaap during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards business combinations and other expenses additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unforeseen or unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs furthermore it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market customer demand for our products customer adoption and renewal rates and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products as a result of these and other factors we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future our gross margins may be negatively impacted and our ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to increase our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our business operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected 

if we suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information and credit card and other financial information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss these measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty actions including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information moreover computer malware viruses and hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as cybersecurity threats develop and evolve it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure a security breach or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation the triggering of indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other liabilities we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches 

if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

the markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly and the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as cloud mobile workflow consumer productlike user experiences social collaboration machine learning artificial intelligence internet connected devices robotic automation security cryptography development tools and other digital technologies increasingly become the basis for customer purchases at the same time our customers and prospective customers are facing their own competitive imperatives to adopt digital technologies resulting in the ongoing disruption of almost every sector of the global economy accordingly to compete effectively in our rapidly changing markets we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies among the many in which we could make investments knowing that we cannot make substantial investments in all of them accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs successfully deliver new platform technologies and products that meet these business needs efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments profitably market and sell new products in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience and effectively deliver either directly or through our ecosystem of partners the business process planning it systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful if we fail to meet any of these requirements our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

delays in the release of or actual or perceived defects in new or updated products may slow the adoption of our most recent technologies reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services decrease customer satisfaction increase our vulnerability to cyber attacks and adversely impact sales of additional products to our customers 

we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products the success of any release depends on a number of factors including our ability to manage the risks associated with quality or other defects or deficiencies delays in the timing of releases and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introduction if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted customer satisfaction may decrease our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced and our growth prospects may be harmed 

various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us or our partners may cause implementations of our products to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful 

our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers increasingly we as well as our customers rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand further various factors including our customers’ business integration migration and security requirements or errors by us or our partners may cause implementations to be delayed inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful for example changes in the functional requirements of our customers delays in timeline or deviation from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project as a result of these and other risks we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase and implementation of our products some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers’ expectations which may delay our ability to upsell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented unsuccessful lengthy or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers harm to our reputation and opportunities for competitors to displace our products each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future for example we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their own businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors some of which are beyond our control for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to vary widely or cause our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include 



 

changes in our effective tax rate could impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in us federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us many countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly changes how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and affect our results of operations in the period issued 

the tax act requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law as such the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain further compliance with the tax act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced as a result we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our financial statements as additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities accounting treatment is clarified we perform additional analysis on the application of the law and we refine estimates in calculating the impact our final analysis which will be recorded in the period completed may be different from our current provisional amounts which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap which are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future which may have a significant effect on our financial results for example in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap under this new standard revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services this new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2018 and we expect this new standard to have a material impact on the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our contracts related to onpremises offerings and on our deferred commissions asset and the related amortization expense refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the new guidance and its impact on us adoption of this standard and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles including the ability to modify our accounting systems and internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods in addition the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union adversely impacted global markets including currencies and resulted in a decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets may continue due to a number of factors including the continued negotiation of the united kingdoms exit from the european union and the recent political and economic uncertainty globally 

while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date in 2018 we expect to begin using derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards swaps and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts may reduce but cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements further unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary moreover for a number of reasons including our limited experience with these hedging contracts we may not seek or be able to establish a perfect or effective correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss 

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we compete primarily with large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors established and emerging cloud vendors and vendors of products and services for development operations many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to our enterprise cloud solutions many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services we have expanded the breadth of our services to include offerings in the markets for it operations management customer service management security operations management hr service delivery and use of our platform by developers of custom applications as a result we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions we expect that smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressures including in the it service management market which is our more mature offering and from which we derive the substantial majority of our revenues for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

lawsuits against us by thirdparties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry many companies in our industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us 

moreover the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses from time to time our competitors or other third parties including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example we recorded charges for aggregate legal settlements of 2700 million in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended december 31 2016 the charge covers the fulfillment by us of all financial obligations under settlement agreements with bmc and hpe with no remaining financial obligations under either settlement 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue we may incur substantial attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages and make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering our products and services modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us further upon expiration of the term of any thirdparty agreements that allow us to use their intellectual property we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all in which case we may face intellectual property litigation the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the courts press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers and could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors in our common stock and could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock accordingly any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under a combination of patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents acquired in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented approximately 33  and 32  of our total revenues for each of the years ended   december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and will subject us to regulatory and economic risks that are different from those in the united states we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new global 2000 customers a key factor effecting our growth has generally been lower in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established as compared to north america australia and areas within western europe over time an increasing proportion of the global 2000 companies that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including in hiring qualified sales management personnel and managing foreign operations 

risks inherent with international sales include without limitation 

 

if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team including our chief executive officer and many key individual contributors from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives for example in 2017 frank slootman stepped down as our president and chief executive officer and john j donahoe was appointed as his successor such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business 

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense our employees including our executive officers are employed by us on an “atwill” basis which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to personal data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

national and local governments or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data changing laws regulations and standards applying to the collection transfer processing storage or use of personal data could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services and in some cases could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally for example the european union eu and united states agreed to a framework to facilitate the transfer of data from the eu to the united states called privacy shield but this new framework has been challenged by private parties and may face additional challenges by national regulators or private parties additionally in 2016 the eu adopted a new regulation governing data privacy called the general data protection regulation gdpr which takes effect in may 2018 further laws such as the eu’s proposed eprivacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals’ online activities 

  

the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by gdpr the eprivacy regulation and other privacy laws regulations and standards may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services in addition noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others significant fines and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries have established or may establish various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could reduce demand for our applications and adversely affect our business 

because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our operating results for that period 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions as a result most of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods consequently a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period in addition our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited 

further a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a given period will negatively affect our revenues in future periods accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under topic 606 will depend on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenues from period to period 

a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our billings results for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease 

a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period due to factors that may offset the decrease such as an increase in billings duration the dollar value of contracts with future start dates or the dollar value of collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

we have acquired or invested in companies and technologies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings functionality or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity or equitylinked securities to pay for any future acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we may continue to incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses new accounting principles such as the new revenue recognition standards that became effective for us beginning january 1 2018 require significant changes to our existing processes and controls we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness 

  

global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us from time to time the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by geopolitical instability high levels of bad debt globally falling demand for a variety of goods and services high levels of persistent unemployment and wage and income stagnation in some geographic markets restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics terrorism political unrest and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

risks related to our 0 convertible senior notes due 2022 2022 notes and our 0 convertible senior notes due 2018 2018 notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible senior notes in cash or to repurchase the convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible senior notes 

holders of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 notes and 2018 notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for each of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes as applicable at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition if a makewhole fundamental change as defined in the indenture for each of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes as applicable occurs prior to the maturity date of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 2022 notes or 2018 notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change upon conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the 2022 notes or 2018 notes being converted 

we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing each of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the 2022 notes and 2018 notes when due furthermore the indentures for each of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 2022 notes and 2018 notes and their respective indentures these and other provisions in each of the indentures could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase 2022 notes or 2018 notes at a time when the repurchase is required by each indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes as required by each indenture would constitute a default a default under each indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under each indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 notes or 2018 notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

the holders of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes may elect to convert their notes during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 17518  in the case of the 2022 notes or 9604  in the case of the 2018 notes in each case the conversion condition the conversion condition was met for the 2018 notes during the three months ended june 30 2017 september 30 2017 and december 31 2017 respectively accordingly the 2018 notes were convertible at the holders’ option during each of the three months ended september 30 2017 and december 31 2017 and will continue to be convertible at the holders’ option through the three months ending march 31 2018 during the year ended december 31 2017  we paid cash to settle an immaterial  principal amount of the 2018 notes based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of 373 million  in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the first quarter of 2018 and 73 million  in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the second quarter of 2018 we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter or the remainder of the year 2018 if one or more holders elect to convert their 2018 notes or 2022 notes if the conversion condition is triggered in future periods unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on extinguishment of the 2018 notes or 2022 notes if the conversion condition is triggered converted by noteholders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes we entered into convertible note hedge the 2022 note hedge and 2018 note hedge respectively transactions with certain financial institutions option counterparties we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock the 2022 warrants and 2018 warrants respectively the 2022 note hedge and 2018 note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2022 notes or 2018 notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the 2022 warrants or 2018 warrants which is 20340 and 10746 respectively 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2022 notes or 2018 notes or following any repurchase of 2022 notes or 2018 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indentures for the 2022 notes and 2018 notes or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2022 notes or 2018 notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the 2022 notes or 2018 notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 2022 notes or 2018 notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2022 notes and 2018 notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any 2022 notes or 2018 notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the 2022 notes or 2018 notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2022 notes or 2018 notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2022 note hedge and 2018 note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2022 note hedge or 2018 note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties   

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock some of which are beyond our control include 

 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business this could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law our 2022 notes and our 2018 notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our 2022 notes or 2018 notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change

new revenue recognition standard under topic 606 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers topic 606 which is effective beginning january 1 2018 topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard topic 605 for periods beginning january 1 2018 the most significant impacts of the standard relate to the timing of revenue recognition related to our onpremises offerings in which we grant customers the right to deploy our software on the customer’s own servers without significant penalty the accounting for incremental costs to obtain a contract and the classification of proceeds from knowledge and other user forums as a reduction in sales and marketing expenses instead of professional services and other revenues 

our results of operations below are presented under topic 605 our expectations for 2018  revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses including the comparison period amounts used to derive the expected trends are based on topic 606 in addition our expectations for 2018 revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2017  refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding topic 606 including adjusted amounts for historical periods 

key business metrics 

  

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 500  350  and 231 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate gult data universal numbering system duns number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million 

g2k customer count the global 2000 g2k customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics sales profit assets and market value the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity for example we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company or any of its related subsidiaries or any combination of entities within a g2k company we count only one g2k customer we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering which is our entrylevel it service management solution our g2k customer count was 840  737  and 637 as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

average acv per g2k customer we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking aggregate acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of g2k customers as of the end of the period acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into and as a result foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer prior g2k customer counts used in calculating acv per g2k are adjusted for the most recent forbes global 2000 list for comparability purposes our average acv per g2k customer was approximately 13 million  11 million  and 09 million as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

renewal rate  we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and total acv from all customers lost during the period accordingly our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customers acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number our renewal rate was 97 for the year ended december 31 2017  and 98  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful 

billings we define billings a nongaap financial measure as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represents the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into us dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business 

a calculation of billings is provided below 



billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers renewals upsells and new customers and contracts for professional services training and our knowledge and other user forum events factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following 

 

 

 

 

accordingly while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings results we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multiyear billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented notwithstanding the adjustments described above the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals for which no adjustments have been presented 

foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable  impact of 83 million  and an unfavorable  impact of 84 million  on billings for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively changes in billings duration had a favorable  impact of 16 million  and 163 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers topic 606 which is effective beginning on january 1 2018 under topic 606 due to the change in timing of revenue recognition under certain of our contracts our definition of billings will be revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue unbilled receivables and customer deposits as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding topic 606 

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies a calculation of free cash flow is provided below 

  

1 free cash flow includes the effect of a 2675 million  payment for aggregate legal settlements for the year ended december 31 2016 refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

average contract term  we calculate the average contract term for new customers upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv the average new customer contract term was 32  months for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the average upsell contract term was 26  months for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the average renewal contract term was 27  months 28  months and 25  months for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively

our service management products include our platform itsm itbm customer service management hr service delivery and security operations which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis our itom products which improve visibility availability and agility of enterprise services are generally priced on a per node basis 

professional services and other revenues increased   244 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base included within our total professional services and other revenues are the revenues from our annual knowledge user conference which increased to 171 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to 128 million  in the prior year due to an increase in registration and sponsorship fees in the current year 

we expect professional services and other revenues under topic 606 for the year ending december 31 2018 to remain flat in absolute dollar terms when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 as adjusted for topic 606 this reflects our plan to focus on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource while relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery as described above under the section entitled “new revenue recognition standard under topic 606” with the adoption of topic 606 proceeds from knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of as professional services and other revenues 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 33  and 32  of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general weakening  of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound sterling from the year ended december 31 2016  to the year ended december 31 2017  had a favorable  impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2017  at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2016  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our reported subscription revenues would have been  63 million   lower  the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended   december 31 2016  to the year ended   december 31 2017  is not material to professional services and other revenues 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 

  



  

cost of subscription revenues increased   802 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 308 million  in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 80 million  in other overhead expenses and an increase of 69 million  in stockbased compensation in addition there was an increase of 178 million  in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers an increase of 72 million  in data center capacity costs primarily due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers and an increase of 23 million  in amortization of intangibles as a result of acquisitions service and technical support agreement and software subscription costs increased 50 million  and outside service costs increased 12 million during year ended   december 31 2017 compared to the prior year 

our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 82  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 81  for the year ended december 31 2016  due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31   2018  as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased   209 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 117 million  in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 21 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 10 million  in stockbased compensation outside service costs increased 46 million during year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased utilization of contracted thirdparty partners for the implementation and configuration of our subscription services 

our professional services and other gross profit percentage increased to 5  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to 3  in the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 171 million  or 10  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31   2017  knowledge contributed 128 million  or 8  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31 2016  

the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended   december 31 2016  to the year ended   december 31   2017 is not material to cost of revenues 

  

sales and marketing 



  

sales and marketing expenses increased   2462 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 1207 million  in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 390 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 220 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 302 million  in commission expense commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 7  of subscription revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased 82 million  from 240 million  for the year ended   december 31 2016  to 322 million  for the year ended   december 31 2017  due to a 29  increase in registrations yearoveryear other marketing program expenses which include expenses related to events other than knowledge and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data increased 174 million  for the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year outside services increased 70 million  primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions 

because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales and marketing expenses outside of the united states the general weakening  of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended   december 31 2016  to the year ended   december 31 2017  had an unfavorable  impact on our sales and marketing expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended   december 31 2017  at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended   december 31 2016  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our sales and marketing expenses would have been  25 million   lower  

 we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2018  in absolute dollar terms when compared to sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 as adjusted for topic 606 but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events as described above under the section entitled “new revenue recognition standard under topic 606” with the adoption of topic 606 proceeds from knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of professional services and other revenues 

research and development 



  

research and development expenses increased   923 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 602 million  in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 144 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 103 million  in stockbased compensation outside services increased 36 million  primarily due to an increase in contractors and consultants that support our research and development functions research and development expenses also increased 18 million  due to depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes 

because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for research and development expenses outside of the united states the general weakening  of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended   december 31 2016  to the year ended   december 31 2017  had an unfavorable  impact on our research and development expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended   december 31 2017  at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended   december 31 2016  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our research and development expenses would have been 13 million   lower  

  we expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2018  in absolute dollar terms but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform 

general and administrative 



  

general and administrative expenses increased   516 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 224 million  in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 193 million  in stockbased compensation and an increase of 23 million  in overhead expenses software subscription costs increased 46 million  and outside services costs which include costs related to contractors and consultants increased 23 million  to support our administrative function amortization of intangibles increased 15 million  and acquisitionrelated costs increased 14 million  from acquisitions in 2017  

 the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended   december 31 2016  to the year ended   december 31 2017  is not material to general and administrative expenses 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2018  in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire new employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

legal settlements 



nm  not meaningful 

legal settlements expense decreased   2700 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year reflecting the legal settlement agreements with hpe and bmc in the prior year refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

  

stockbased compensation 

  



stockbased compensation expense increased   765 million during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount and increased weightedaverage grant date fair value of equity awards 

stockbased compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2017  we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to increase for the year ended   december 31   2018  in absolute dollar terms but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

interest expense 



interest expense increased   201 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes including the 2022 notes issued in the three months ended june 30 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018  we expect to incur approximately 633 million  in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the convertible notes 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



nm  not meaningful 

interest income and other income expense net decreased   02 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss partially offset by increased interest income foreign exchange losses  increased 89 million  for the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest income increased 81 million  due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the prior year 

our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we currently expect to initiate a hedging program to hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in 2018 

  

  provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 0  for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  our tax expense decreased 16 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to the prior year primarily due to the tax effects of unrealized gains in investment securities see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted into law changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations significant changes include but are not limited to a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system we are required to recognize the effect of the tax act in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the tax act enactment date since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements the impact of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates prior to the enactment of the tax act we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the tax act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the sec we expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period described above 

net loss 



net loss decreased   3027 million  during the year ended   december 31 2017  primarily reflecting the settlement agreements we entered into with hpe and bmc during the prior year refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details we expect to continue to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31   2018  due to increased costs and expenses including noncash charges associated with equity awards amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions and other expenses

revenues 

  



  

subscription revenues increased 3734 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year driven by upsells and an increase in customer count

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 32 and 30 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily euro and the british pound sterling from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional 63 million the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 173 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 80 million in personnelrelated costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 32 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 34 million in overhead expenses 

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3 during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 7 in the prior year due to lower utilization rates as we invested in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stockbased compensation of 14 compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7 partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 128 million or 8 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2016 knowledge contributed 109 million or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2015 

because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues outside of the united states the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31 2016 our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional 33 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional 16 million

in addition expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased 30 million from 210 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 240 million for the year ended december 31 2016 due to a 35  increase in registration yearoveryear all other marketing program expenses which include expenses related to events other than knowledge and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data increased 186 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year 

because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales and marketing expenses outside of the united states the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had a favorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional 63 million

  provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 0 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 3 for the prior year our tax expense decreased 37 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to a partial release of valuation allowance in connection with business combinations see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



 

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the subscription agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements including the timing of capital expenditures we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2017  we had 18 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 2506 million  represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries 1915 million  of the 18 billion are denominated in currencies other than us dollar in addition we had  3914 million  in longterm investments that provide additional capital resources we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 

prior to the enactment of the tax act we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the tax act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the sec we expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

in november 2013 we issued the 2018 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million the 2018 notes mature on november 1 2018 unless converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date in connection with the issuance of the 2018 notes we entered into the 2018 note hedge transactions and 2018 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions the option counterparties we may elect to settle the 2018 notes in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares if the 2018 note hedges are exercised we may elect to receive cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares 

the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price of the 2018 notes for at least 20  trading days during the 30  consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30 2017 september 30 2017 and december 31 2017 therefore the 2018 notes first became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on july 1 2017 and continue to be convertible at the holders option through march 31 2018 the impact of the conversion of the 2018 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect for each instrument described above we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2018 notes in cash 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we paid cash to settle an immaterial  principal amount of the 2018 notes due to early conversion requests based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of 373 million  in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the first quarter of 2018 and 73 million  in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the second quarter of 2018 we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter or the remainder of the year 2018 

in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million we currently intend to use approximately 5750 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 notes to repay the 2018 notes in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions refer to note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the 2022 notes the 2022 notes hedges and the 2022 warrants in addition in may 2017 we used approximately 550 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 notes to repurchase shares of our common stock sold by certain purchasers of the 2022 notes and during the three months ended june 30 2017 we used approximately 739 million to pay the cost of the 2022 note hedges after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 warrants 

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the repayment of our 2018 notes expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets intangibles and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions andor debt retirements if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing

cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization amortization of premiums on investments amortization of deferred commissions amortization of issuance cost and debt discount stockbased compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6428 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 1599 million  for the prior year the increase  in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss by 3027 million  the remaining change was due to an increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1599 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 3178 million for the prior year the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to 2675 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31 2016 refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details the remaining change was due to an increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2017  was 8839 million  compared to 1082 million  for the prior year the increase  in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a 7147 million   increase  in net purchases of investments a 449 million   increase  in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth a 239 million   increase  in business combinations net of cash and restricted cash acquired and a 43 million   increase  in purchases of strategic investments the increase  in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a 121 million   decrease  in purchases of other intangibles 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 was 1082 million  compared to 2315 million  for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a 1816 million decrease in net purchases of investments and a 100 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments partially offset by a 332 million increase in business combinations net of cash and restricted cash acquired a 170 million increase in purchases of other intangibles and a 181 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth 

  financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended   december 31 2017  was 5389 million  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 558 million  for the prior year the change was primarily due to a 6982 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 notes and the 2022 note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions entered into during the year ended december 31 2017 and a 162 million   increase  in proceeds from employee stock plans partially offset by a 620 million   increase  in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a 550 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 was 558 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 803 million for the prior year the change was primarily due to a 1071 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all us employees starting in 2016 and a 270 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table represents our future noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  aggregated by type 



 

in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 48 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2017  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues from two sources i subscriptions and ii professional services and other subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term 

our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with services provided to customers for process design implementation configuration and optimization of our products professional services and other revenues also include customer training and registration and sponsorship fees for our annual knowledge user conference and other user forums 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

• there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

• the service has been provided to the customer 

• the collection of related fees is reasonably assured and 

• the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

we use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer in subsequent transactions with an existing customer including an upsell or a renewal we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers once our services are available to customers we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue to the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date 

our professional services arrangements are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met 

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us in addition the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development modification or customization we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term in determining whether professional services have standalone value we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services have standalone value 

the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price besp we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and current pricing practices in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis 

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software as we never sell the nonsoftware elements separately from the software elements we have determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value for all undelivered nonsoftware elements consequently we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered once the delivery of the last element has commenced we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred commissions 

  

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related customer contracts we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized the commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer’s initial service under the contract commences 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included but are not limited to cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future discount rates the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform a goodwill impairment test to calculate any potential impairment we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down we have determined that we have a single reporting unit we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit 

we periodically review the carrying amounts of longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate if we consider any of these assets to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value in addition we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months  to ten years  

screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred including market conditions operating fundamentals competition and general economic conditions requires significant judgment additionally changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly therefore there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets impairment tests 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units rsus on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years for rsus granted with a performance condition the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp on a straightline basis over the offering period we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

new accounting pronouncements 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted into law and significantly changed how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations changes include but are not limited to a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system we are required to recognize the effect of the tax act in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the tax act enactment date since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements the impact of the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers topic 606 which is effective beginning january 1 2018 topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard topic 605 under topic 606 for our on‑premises offerings we will recognize a portion of the subscription revenue when the onpremises offering is made available resulting in a larger amount of upfront subscription revenue and a smaller amount of deferred revenue compared with topic 605 which required ratable revenue recognition over the contract period due to the complexity of certain customer contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under topic 606 will depend on contractspecific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period 

under topic 606 we will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts including indirect costs that are not tied to a specific contract on initial contracts only the portion equivalent to a renewal commission will be amortized over the contract term while the portion incremental to a renewal commission will be amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years on renewal contracts these costs will be amortized over the renewal term additionally for our onpremises offerings consistent with the recognition of subscription revenue for onpremises offerings as described above a portion of the commission costs will be expensed upfront when the onpremises offering is made available under topic 605 we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over the contract term which is generally 12 to 36 months 

for details regarding these and other recently issued accounting standards refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and conversely are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 73  during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  and 74  during the year ended december 31 2015  changes in exchange rates have recently positively affected and may continue to positively affect our total revenues 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded we recognized net foreign currency loss es of 111 million  and 22 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may do so in 2018 

a hypothetical 10 increase in the us dollar against other currencies would have resulted in an increase in operating loss of approximately 137 million  and 77 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the hypothetical increase in operating loss for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  is due to an assumed decrease in the mix of foreign currency revenue relative to foreign currency expenses this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 22 billion  in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments as of december 31 2017  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poors baa2 by moodys or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 

as of december 31 2017  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 107 million  decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of 12 billion  in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 57 million  decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued the 2018 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million and in may and june 2017 we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of 7825 million we carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because these instruments does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2017  we had 58 million  invested in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value

customers 

  

we primarily sell our services to large enterprise customers we host and support large enterprisewide deployments for our customers as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 3600 enterprise customers including more than 30 of the global 2000 an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine our customers operate in a wide variety of industries including financial services consumer products it services health care technology and government no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues for any of the periods presented 

  

backlog 

backlog represents future unearned revenue amounts to be invoiced under our existing agreements and is not included in the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016 and 2015  we had backlog of approximately 19 billion and 13 billion  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we manage our operations and allocate resources as a single organizational entity and therefore we manage monitor and report our financials as a single reporting segment for information regarding our revenue revenue by geographic area and longlived assets by geographic area please refer to note 2 and note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segment please refer to the section entitled “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii and to our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding risks associated with our international operations please refer to the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

  

our research and development organization is responsible for the design development testing and certification of our software solutions we focus on developing new services and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality reliability and performance of existing solutions we focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand and then bringing new services and new versions of existing services to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing applications expand the number of applications on our platform and develop additional automation and machine intelligence technologies total research and development expense was 2852 million  2174 million and 1483 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

competition 

  

the markets for our solutions and enterprise cloud services generally are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we compete primarily with large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud vendors many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud solution accordingly we compete with both enterprise application software vendors that provide onpremise software and with vendors providing cloud based services 

our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc microsoft corporation oracle corporation sap and salesforcecom further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services as we continue to expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets 

various factors influence purchase decisions in our industry including total cost of ownership level of customer satisfaction breadth and depth of product functionality security and adherence to industry standards brand awareness flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors also have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale as competition intensifies we expect pricing competition to continue or increase 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our intellectual property ip rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees partners vendors consultants and other third parties and control access to our ip and other proprietary information we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services 

we continue to grow our patent portfolio and ip rights around the world that relate to our products services research and development and other activities and our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and ip we file patent applications to protect our ip and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products however we cannot be certain that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of value or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our solutions policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our customers in addition based on our greater visibility and market exposure as a public company we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties for example in 2016 we settled two patentrelated litigation matters and recorded a onetime charge of 2700 million related to aggregate legal settlements see “risk factorsclaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” and “legal proceedings” below for additional information 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had 4801 fulltime employees worldwide including 1225 in cloud operations professional services training and customer support 1875 in sales and marketing 1054 in research and development and 647 in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries are represented by workers councils and also have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we consider our relations with our employees to be very good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes report before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline and we expect to continue to incur losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods however our revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business even if our revenues continue to increase we expect to continue to incur a loss in accordance with gaap during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards business combinations and other expenses additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unforeseen or unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs furthermore it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market customer demand for our products customer adoption and renewal rates and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products as a result we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future our gross margins may be negatively impacted and our ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to grow our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our business operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected 

we have recently introduced products in new markets that are important to our growth prospects and for which we do not have a substantial operating history if we are unsuccessful in competing in these new markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we have recently introduced products in the markets for it operations management customer service security operations hr service management and the use of our platform for other service management applications outside of enterprise it our successful entry into these and other new markets is important to our revenue growth prospects we do not have a substantial operating history with these products which limits our ability to forecast operating results and the success of our efforts to address these markets depends on many factors including the degree of differentiation of our products and services from those offered by more established competitors in these markets whether our product and services offer compelling benefits and value to customers the timeframe and quality of our research and development efforts the rigor and effectiveness of our quality testing and controls and our ability to successfully market and sell into new markets with which our marketing and sales personnel are less experienced we may not have the necessary resources including employees with the required product management engineering marketing and sales expertise to compete effectively in these new markets any new service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner may not be priced appropriately may not offer compelling customer benefits compared to competing products and services and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues in addition the partner ecosystem for some of our new products is less developed than for our more mature products and some of our new products require a commitment of resources and expertise by our customers which they may lack to ensure a successful implementation if we are not able to successfully develop market sell and implement these and other newly introduced products and services to our existing customers and prospective new customers our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

if we suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive information including in some cases personally identifiable information protected health information and credit card and other sensitive financial information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss they may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information moreover computer malware viruses and hacking phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as cybersecurity threats develop and grow it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure a security breach or unauthorized access or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service litigation the triggering of indemnification and other contractual obligations regulatory investigations government fines and penalties reputational damage loss of sales and customers mitigation and remediation expenses and other liabilities we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches 

disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future for example we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control including denial of service attacks we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their own businesses and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our warranty provisions or service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

our stock price can be volatile including if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts and the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows or our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors or otherwise cause our stock price to be volatile include 

 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could impact our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such determination is made our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

additionally our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles changes in us federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings for example the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings many countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws such as legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom and in australia in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development released guidance and is expected to continue to issue guidance and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business and which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities any changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap which are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future which may have a significant effect on our financial results for example in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap under the new standard revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services this new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2018 and we expect the new standard to have a material impact on the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our contracts related to onpremises offerings and on our deferred commissions asset and the related amortization expense we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and our preliminary assessments are subject to change refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the new guidance and its potential impact on us adoption of this standard and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles including the ability to modify our accounting systems could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar may impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods in addition the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union adversely impacted global markets including currencies and resulted in a decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies volatility in exchange rates may continue as the united kingdom negotiates its exit from the european union 

we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies however in the future we may use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place moreover the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments 

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we compete primarily with large wellestablished enterprise application software vendors inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud vendors our primary competitors include bmc software inc microsoft corporation oracle corporation sap and salesforcecom many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud solution many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in the markets for it operations management customer service security operations hr service management and use of our platform for other service management applications outside of enterprise it we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions we expect that smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate pricing pressure including in the it service management market which is our more mature offering and from which we derive the substantial majority of our revenues for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

lawsuits against us by thirdparties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry many companies in our industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us 

moreover the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses from time to time our competitors or other third parties including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example in 2016 we settled two patentrelated litigation matters and recorded a onetime charge of 2700 million related to aggregate legal settlements 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue we may incur substantial attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses and if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages and make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering our products and services modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us moreover the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the courts press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers and could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors in our common stock and could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock accordingly any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under a combination of patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented approximately 32 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and will subject us to regulatory and economic risks that are different from those in the united states we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful our rate of acquisition of new global 2000 customers a key factor effecting our growth has generally been lower in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established as compared to north america australia and areas within western europe over time an increasing proportion of the global 2000 companies that are not yet our customers are located in emerging markets where we are less established we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including in hiring qualified sales management personnel and managing foreign operations 

risks inherent with international sales include without limitation 

 

if we are unable to manage these risks if our required investments in these international markets are greater than anticipated or if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales in emerging markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continuously enhance our products and services to deliver consumer productlike experiences mobility messaging and ease of use they could become less competitive or obsolete and our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we believe that enterprises are increasingly focused on delivering a consumer productlike technology experience to users within the enterprise such as employees and to individuals interacting with the enterprise such as customers partners and suppliers accordingly our ability to attract new customers and to renew and increase revenues from existing customers depends on our ability to continuously enhance our products and services and provide them in ways that are broadly accepted in particular we need to continuously modify and improve our products and services to keep pace with changes in user expectations including for intuitive and attractive consumer productlike interfaces use and mobility features messaging social networking and communication database hardware and security technologies if we are unable to consistently and timely meet these requirements our products and services may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of employees which could disrupt our business for example our founder and chief product officer frederic luddy retired in october 2016 although he continues to serve as a member of our board of directors and daniel r mcgee resigned as our chief operating officer in december 2016 effective as of april 3 2017 frank slootman will resign and john j donahoe will be appointed as our president and chief executive officer although mr slootman will continue to serve as the chairman of our board of directors our employees are generally employed on an atwill basis which means that our employees could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could have a serious impact on our business in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing crossborder data transfer restrictions other foreign and domestic regulations and standards related to personal data and the internet may adversely affect our business 

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data changing laws regulations and standards applying to the solicitation collection transfer processing storage or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services and in some cases could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally for example the european court of justice in october 2015 issued a ruling immediately invalidating the useu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which our customers relied upon to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states in compliance with applicable european data protection laws notwithstanding the recent adoption of the privacy shield framework by the european union and the united states there is uncertainty surrounding how data transfers from the european economic area to the united states will be authorized in the future in addition the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above 

moreover complying with the recently adopted eu general data protection regulation or other new data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services in addition noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and may otherwise adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries have established or may establish various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards it could reduce demand for our applications and adversely affect our business 

because we recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions as a result most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small and perhaps no apparent impact on our revenue results for that quarter further a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that quarter due to factors that may offset the decline such as an increase in billings duration a decline in the amount of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current quarter related to contracts with future start dates billings consists of amounts invoiced for contracts with new customers upsells renewals backlog professional services training and our knowledge and other customer forum events while we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services customers sometimes request and we accommodate billings durations that differ from the typical twelve month term in addition we frequently enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date factors such as the weighted average billings duration and the timing of contract start dates and the timing of collections create variability in billings 

further a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any given quarter will negatively affect our revenues and billings in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

we have acquired or invested in companies in the past as part of our business strategy and may continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity or equity linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock furthermore if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we may continue to incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses new accounting principles such as the new revenue recognition standards that are effective for us beginning january 1 2018 require significant changes to our existing processes and controls we may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for the new standards on a timely basis any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness 

  

weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by high levels of bad debt globally geopolitical instability slowing economic growth in china falling demand for a variety of goods and services including oil and other commodities high levels of persistent unemployment and wage and income stagnation in some geographic markets restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy in addition the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union creates significant future economic uncertainties across the european economic area including the united kingdom these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics terrorism political unrest and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and would cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california and washington customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

risks related to our 0 convertible senior notes due 2018 notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes 

holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition if a makewhole fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the notes occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted 

we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due furthermore the indenture for the notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to note holders 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions option counterparties we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock or warrants the note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indenture for the notes or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock some of which are beyond our control include 

 

following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business this could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law and our notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 4801 as of december 31 2016 from 3686 as of december 31 2015  

key business metrics 

  

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 341  227 and 157 customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively for purposes of customer count a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate gult data universal numbering system duns and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to government of the united states under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than 1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than 1 million 

g2k customer count the global 2000 g2k customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics sales profit assets and market value the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity to ensure the g2k customer count is accurately captured for example we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company or any of its related subsidiaries or any combination of entities within a g2k company we count only one g2k customer we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering which is our entrylevel it service management solution 

our g2k customer count was 735  633 and 533 as of december 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

average acv per g2k customer we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking cumulative acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by cumulative count of g2k customers as of the end of the period foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer our average acv per g2k customer was approximately 11 million  09 million and 07 million as of december 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

renewal rate we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from lost customers divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and total acv from all lost customers accordingly our renewal rate is a calculation based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customers acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer for our renewal rate calculation we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number our renewal rate was 98 for the years ended   december 31 2016 and 2015 and 97 for the year ended december 31 2014  as renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals which could occur in advance of or subsequent to the original contract end date periodtoperiod comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful 

billings we define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into us dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business 

a calculation of billings is provided below 



billings consists of amounts invoiced for contracts with new customers upsells renewals backlog professional services training and our knowledge and other customer forum events while we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services customers sometimes request and we accommodate billings durations that differ from the typical twelve month term in addition from time to time we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date factors such as the weighted average billings duration the timing of contract start dates and timing of collections create variability in billings accordingly while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline such as an increase in billings duration a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

to facilitate greater yearoveryear comparability in our billings information we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by applying the weighted average billings duration in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual weighted average billings duration in effect during the current period weighted average billings duration refers to the weighted average billings duration for all our customer contracts commencing during the period unless such amounts have been paid during the period although we believe these adjustments improve comparability of our billings information from period to period a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline such as a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates 

foreign currency rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 84 million and 743 million on billings for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively changes in weighted average billings duration had a favorable impact of 246 million and 18 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively

comparison of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 

  

revenues 

  



  

subscription revenues increased 3734 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year driven by upsells and an increase in customer count we expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended december 31 2017 as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers our expectations for 2017 revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2016  

subscription revenues consist of the following 



our service management solutions include servicenow platform it service management it business management customer service human resources and security operations which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis our it operations management solutions which improve visibility availability and agility of enterprise services are generally priced on a per node basis 

professional services and other revenues increased 117 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to 128 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 109 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year we expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 32 and 30 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively as a result the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily euro from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional  63 million  the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues 

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 

  



  

cost of subscription revenues increased 520 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 173 million in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 50 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 72 million in other overhead expenses in addition there was an increase of 103 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers an increase of 53 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the expansion of our data centers and an increase of 15 million in amortization of intangible assets as a result of acquisitions in 2016 

our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 81 for the year ended december 31 2016  from 78 for the year ended december 31 2015  due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2017 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 173 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 80 million in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 32 million in stockbased compensation and an increase of 34 million in overhead expenses 

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3 during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 7 in the prior year due to lower utilization rates as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stockbased compensation of 14 compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7  partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 128 million  or 8 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2016  knowledge contributed 109 million  or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2015  we expect cost of professional services and other revenues to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in professional services and other revenues leading to an increase in professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2017  

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31 2016  our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional  33 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional  16 million

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 had a favorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional  63 million  

we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended december 31 2017 in absolute dollar terms but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 

research and development

the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 is not material to research and development expenses

general and administrative

legal settlements 



legal settlements increased 2700 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year related to the settlement agreements with hpe and bmc refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details of these matters 

  

stockbased compensation 

  



stockbased compensation increased 599 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to equity grants to new employees and additional grants to current employees 

stockbased compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price based upon our stock price as of december 31 2016  we expect stockbased compensation to continue to increase for the year ended december 31 2017 in absolute dollar terms but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

interest expense 



interest expense increased 22 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes notes issued in november 2013 during the year ended december 31 2017  we expect to incur approximately 356 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



interest income and other income expense net increased 16 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased interest income partially offset by increased foreign exchange losses we had foreign exchange losses of 22 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to gains of 01 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest income increased 33 million due to the higher yields during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year 

our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

our effective tax rate was 0 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 3 for the prior year our tax expense decreased 37 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to a partial release of valuation allowance in connection with acquisitions see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

net loss 



net loss increased 2534 million during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to legal settlements refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details of these matters we expect to continue to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31 2017  due to increased costs and expenses including noncash charges associated with equity awards amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations and other expenses

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings similarly this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers we have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended september 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended june 30 our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements including the timing of capital expenditures we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above 

liquidity and capital resources 



  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2016  we had 8994 million in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 1845 million represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries in addition we had  2627 million in longterm investments that provide additional capital resources 

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets intangibles and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions andor debt retirements if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing 

  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization amortization of premiums on investments amortization of deferred commissions amortization of issuance cost and debt discount stockbased compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1599 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 3178 million for the prior year the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to 2675 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31 2016 refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details the remaining change was due to an increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3178 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1409 million for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31 2015 net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30 for the year ended december 31 2015 as well as timing of our cash payments 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 was 1084 million compared to 2317 million for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the 1816 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and 100 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments partially offset by 332 million increase in business combinations net of cash acquired 170 million increase in purchase of other intangibles and 181 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2015 was 2317 million compared to 3169 million for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the 320 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the 987 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions offset by the 331 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth and the 105 million increase in the purchases of strategic investments 

  financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 was 558 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 803 million for the prior year the change was primarily due to the 1071 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all us employees starting in 2016 and 270 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years based upon our stock price as of december 31 2016  we expect an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards for the year ended december 31 2017  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015 was 803 million compared to 687 million for the prior year the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the 240 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans offset by the 121 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table represents our future noncancelable contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  aggregated by type 



 

subsequent to the year ended december 31 2016 we entered into certain lease agreements for additional office space total future minimum lease payments under these operating leases of approximately 521 million in aggregate are not included in the table above 296 million of the 521 million relates to an expansion and lease term extension of our existing san diego office facility 

in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 40 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2016  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues from two sources i subscriptions and ii professional services and other subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term 

our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge our annual user conference and other customer forums 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

the service has been provided to the customer 

the collection of related fees is reasonably assured and 

the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

we use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer in subsequent transactions with an existing customer including an upsell or a renewal we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers once our services are available to customers we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue to the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date 

our professional services arrangements are primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met 

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us in addition the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development modification or customization we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term in determining whether professional services have standalone value we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services have standalone value 

the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price besp we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and current pricing practices in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis 

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software as we never sell the nonsoftware elements separately from the software elements we have determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value for all undelivered nonsoftware elements consequently we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered once the delivery of the last element has commenced we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred commissions 

  

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related customer contracts we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized the commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer’s initial service under the contract commences 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included but are not limited to cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future discount rates the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform a twostep impairment test the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment under the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill we have determined that we have a single reporting unit we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit 

we periodically review the carrying amounts of longlived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate if we consider any of these assets to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value in addition we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to ten years  

screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred including market conditions operating fundamentals competition and general economic conditions requires significant judgment additionally changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly therefore there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets impairment tests 

legal contingencies 

  

from time to time we are a party to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we accrue for loss contingencies when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss or range of loss and when based on the advice of counsel it is probable that we will incur the loss because of uncertainties related to these matters we base our estimate on the information available at the time of our assessment as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimate any revisions in the estimate of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units rsus on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years for rsus granted with a performance condition the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp on a straightline basis over the offering period we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

  

new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2016 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification in the statement of cash flows this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2017 and early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended june 30 2016 the impact of the early adoption was as follows

pending accounting pronouncements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test the standard requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value in addition this new standard eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 “business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses the definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions disposals goodwill and consolidation this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 financial instrumentsoverall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities which addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments this new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements

the guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective method we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented 

  

we expect the new standard to impact the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our contracts related to onpremises offerings in which we grant customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customer’s own servers under this new standard the requirement to have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for undelivered elements is eliminated as such we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software compared to the current practice of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated subscription period due to the lack of vsoe currently revenues from our onpremises offerings under the ratable recognition model represent less than 10 of our total revenues costs associated with our onpremises offerings including commissions paid on the software will be expensed immediately under the new standard 

in addition we expect the new standard to impact our deferred commissions asset and the related amortization expense as the types of incremental costs requiring capitalization as well as the expense amortization period could change from our current practice we currently expect the deferred commissions asset to increase and the related amortization expense in each reporting period to decrease under the new standard due to an increase in the average term over which such commissions are amortized 

we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and our preliminary assessments are subject to change 



foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 73  74 and 72 during the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our total revenues 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded we recognized a net foreign currency loss of 22 million and a foreign currency gain 01 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may do so in the future 

a hypothetical 10 decrease in the us dollar against other currencies would result in a decrease in operating loss of approximately 94 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the change in hypothetical reduction in operating loss for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 is due to an increase in the mix of foreign currency revenue relative to foreign currency expenses this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 12 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments at december 31 2016  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poors baa2 by moodys or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 57 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of 12 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 74 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because this instrument does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2016  we had 110 million invested in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value

a hypothetical 10 decrease in the us dollar against other currencies would result in a decrease in operating loss of approximately 94 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the change in hypothetical reduction in operating loss for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 is due to an increase in the mix of foreign currency revenue relative to foreign currency expenses this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 12 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments at december 31 2016  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poors baa2 by moodys or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 57 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of 12 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 74 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because this instrument does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

as of december 31 2016  we had 110 million invested in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value

in the first quarter of 2015 we changed our definition of customer count to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking refer to the “total customers” paragraph section in item 7 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for further details of the change 

  

backlog 

backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our existing agreements and is not included in the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had backlog of approximately 13 billion  and 10 billion  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment for information regarding our revenue revenue by geographic area and longlived assets by geographic area please refer to note 2 and note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segment please refer to the section entitled “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii and to our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding risks associated with our international operations please refer to the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10k

competition 

  

the markets in which we compete to manage service across the enterprise are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company international business machines corporation and salesforcecom further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets 

the principal competitive factors in our industry include total cost of ownership product functionality breadth of offerings security flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish protect and grow our proprietary rights we also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees consultants and other third parties and control access to our proprietary information 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our solutions policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

companies in our industry own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights we currently face and we expect we will face in the future allegations that we have infringed the trademarks copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties including our competitors and nonpracticing entities as we face increasing competition and as our business grows we will likely face more claims of infringement for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company “hewlettpackard” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of hewlettpackards patents hewlettpackard is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction on september 23 2014 bmc software inc “bmc” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of seven bmc patents on february 12 2016 bmc filed a second lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of five bmc patents bmc is seeking damages and an injunction for additional information see the sections entitled risk factors in item 1a and legal proceedings in item 3 of part i of this annual report on form 10k 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had 3686  fulltime employees worldwide including 1065  in operations professional services training and customer support 1416  in sales and marketing 756  in research and development and 449  in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes report before making an investment decision we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline and we expect to continue to incur losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 

from the year ended june 30 2009 to the year ended december 31 2015  our revenues grew from 193 million to 10 billion  although we experienced revenue growth in prior periods our revenue growth rate is declining and we expect that it will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business even if our revenues continue to increase we expect to continue to incur a loss in accordance with gaap during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards business combinations and other expenses additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unforeseen or unpredictable factors that may result in increased costs furthermore it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market customer demand for our products customer adoption and renewal rates and the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products as a result we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future our gross margins may be negatively impacted and our ability to generate cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted if we fail to grow our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our business operations operating results and growth prospects will be adversely affected 

we have recently introduced products in new markets that are important to our growth prospects and for which we do not have an operating history if we are unsuccessful in competing in these new markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we have recently introduced products in the markets for it operations management customer service security incident management and use of our platform for service management outside of enterprise it our successful entry into these and other new markets is important to our revenue growth prospects we do not have a substantial operating history with these products which limits our ability to forecast operating results and the success of our efforts to address these markets depends on many factors including the degree of differentiation of our products and services from those offered by more established competitors in these markets whether our product and services offer compelling benefits and value to customers the timeframe and quality of our research and development efforts the rigor and effectiveness of our quality testing and controls and our ability to successfully market and sell into new markets with which our marketing and sales personnel are less experienced we may not have the necessary resources including employees with the required product management engineering marketing and sales expertise to compete effectively in these markets any new service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner may not be priced appropriately may not offer compelling customer benefits compared to competing products and services and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues if we are not able to successfully develop market and sell these and other newly introduced products and services to our existing customers and prospective new customers our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

if we are unsuccessful in increasing our rate of growth in new geographic markets our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

sales outside of north america represented approximately 30  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business additionally operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and will subject us to regulatory and economic risks that are different from those in the united states we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure sales marketing personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets such as brazil and various countries within asia when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether and when sales in the new market will justify our investments and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful or whether we will be successful for example our rate of acquisition of new global 2000 customers a key factor effecting our growth has generally been greater in north america australia and in areas within europe than it has been in africa asia eastern europe south america and other markets in which we are less established accordingly if we continue to further penetrate the global 2000 at a higher rate in our established markets than in our emerging markets over time an increasing percentage of the overall global 2000 enterprises that are not yet our customers are in markets in which we have generally had a lower rate of customer acquisition or in which we are not yet competing additionally currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions or the effective prices we realize in our reporting currency we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in some of our investments in geographic expansion including in hiring qualified sales management personnel if we are unsuccessful in making these investments or if our required investments are greater than anticipated our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we expect competition to cause the sales prices of our products to decline which may harm our financial results 

the sales prices for our products subscriptions and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and subscriptions anticipation of the introduction of new products or subscriptions or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions in addition we expect that smaller competitors and new entrants may accelerate the decline of prices in the it service management market which is our more mature offering from which we derive the substantial majority of our revenues and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we may not be successful in developing and introducing new offerings on a timely basis and any new product and subscription offerings if introduced may not enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain positive gross margins 

if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

for any quarterly or annual period there is a risk that our financial performance will not meet the financial guidance we have previously given for that period or that we may otherwise fail to meet the financial performance expectations of the securities analysts who issue reports on our company and our common stock price or of investors in our common stock there is also a risk that we may issue forwardlooking financial guidance for a quarterly or annual period that fails to meet the expectations of such securities analysts or investors if any of the foregoing occurs for any reason either within or outside of our control the price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows or our forwardlooking financial guidance to fall below the expectations of such securities analysts or investors include

lawsuits against us by thirdparties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry our success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or services from time to time our competitors or other third parties including patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights 

  

for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company “hewlettpackard” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of us patent nos 6331229 the “’229 patent” 7027411 the “’411 patent” 7392300 the “’300 patent” 7610512 the “’512 patent” 7890802 the “’802 patent” 7925981 the “’981 patent” 7945860 the “’860 patent” and 8224683 the “’683 patent” hewlettpackard is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction we filed an answer to the complaint on march 28 2014 denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses the parties are currently conducting discovery hewlettpackard served infringement contentions on july 3 2014 and november 18 2014 we served invalidity contentions on january 9 2015 on march 10 2015 the court granted our motion for summary judgment finding that the asserted claims of four of the eight asserted hewlettpackard patents are invalid for failing to claim patentable subject matter on october 13 2015 the court granted in part our renewed motion for a stay of litigation staying all proceedings as to two of the four remaining asserted patents pending final decisions from the united states patent and trademark office on our petitions for inter partes  review a claim construction hearing for the two asserted patents not subject to the court’s stay is scheduled for april 29 2016 the trial is currently scheduled to begin on may 22 2017 we filed petitions for inter partes  review with the united states patent trial and appeal board “ptab” seeking to invalidate all eight hewlett packard patents the ptab granted our petitions for inter partes  review of the ‘229 ‘411 ‘300 and ‘683 patents and denied our petitions of the remaining four patents we also filed petitions for covered business method “cbm” review with the ptab seeking to invalidate the ‘981 and ‘860 patents the ptab denied our petitions for cbm review of the ‘981 and ‘860 patents 

on or about november 1 2015 hewlettpackard separated into two independently publicly traded companies i hewlett packard enterprise company “hpe” and ii hp inc as part of this separation hewlettpackard assigned to hpe all right title and interest in the eight hewlettpackard patents in suit on or about november 4 2015 hewlettpackard filed a stipulated request to substitute hpe for hewlettpackard and the court granted the stipulated request substituting hpe for hewlettpackard as plaintiff in the litigation 

on september 23 2014 bmc software inc “bmc” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of us patent nos 5978594 the “‘594 patent” 6816898 the “‘898 patent” 6895586 the “‘586 patent” 7062683 the “‘683 patent” 7617073 the “‘073 patent” 8646093 the “‘093 patent” and 8674992 the “‘992 patent” bmc is seeking damages and an injunction bmc served infringement contentions on january 6 2015 we served invalidity contentions on march 3 2015 we filed an answer to the complaint on june 1 2015 denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses a claim construction hearing occurred on july 10 2015 followed by the courts claim construction order on august 13 2015 on january 25 2016 the court issued an order dismissing all of bmc’s claims related to the ‘594 and ‘093 patents without prejudice on february 23 2016 bmc voluntarily withdrew all claims related to the ‘073 patent the trial is currently scheduled to begin on march 11 2016 we filed petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate the ‘594 ‘073 ‘898 ‘586 ‘093 and ‘992 patents the ptab granted our petitions for inter partes review of the ‘594 ‘073 and ‘992 patents and denied our petitions of the ‘586 ‘093 and ‘898 patents we also filed petitions for cbm review with the ptab seeking to invalidate the ‘683 and ‘093 patents the ptab granted our petition for cbm review of the ‘093 patent and denied our petition for cbm review of the ‘683 patent 

on february 12 2016 bmc filed an additional lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of us patent nos 7877783 the “‘783 patent” 7966398 the “‘398 patent” 8554750 the “‘750 patent” the ‘586 patent and the ‘898 patent bmc is seeking damages and an injunction the court has not yet set a schedule for this lawsuit 

we intend to vigorously defend against hpe’s and bmcs lawsuits the final outcome with respect to the claims in the lawsuits including our liability if any is uncertain furthermore we cannot be certain that any claims by hpe or bmc would be resolved in our favor for example an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us could result in injunctive relief could result in a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments and could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us moreover to the extent we are found to infringe on any valid claims asserted against us our attempt to modify our products so that they are no longer infringing may be unsuccessful could cause us to incur substantial expense could be a distraction to management and any such modified products may not be well received in the market to the extent that we reach a negotiated settlement the settlement could require that we pay substantial royalties and could require that we make modifications to our products that may not be well received in the market 

at this stage in these litigation matters any possible monetary loss or range of monetary loss cannot be estimated the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period or settled on unfavorable terms our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

in any intellectual property litigation regardless of the scope or merits of the claims at issue we may incur substantial attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses and if the claims are successfully asserted against us we could be required to pay substantial damages and make substantial ongoing royalty payments cease offering our products and services modify our products and services comply with other unfavorable terms including settlement terms and indemnify our customers and business partners and obtain costly licenses on their behalf and refund fees or other payments previously paid to us moreover the mere existence of any lawsuit or any interim or final outcomes and the course of its conduct and the public statements related to it or absence of such statements by the courts press analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers and could cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and cause us to lose potential sales and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors in our common stock and could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock accordingly any claim or litigation against us could be costly timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results 

if we suffer a cybersecurity event we may lose customers lose future sales experience business interruption and injury to our competitive position and incur significant liabilities any of which would harm our business and operating results 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive information including in some cases personally identifiable information protected health information proprietary information and credit card and other sensitive financial information while we have security measures in place designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss they may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information a security breach or unauthorized access could result in the loss or exposure of this data litigation indemnity and other contractual obligations government fines and penalties mitigation expenses and other liabilities additionally the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as cybersecurity threats develop and grow it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we could suffer severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed we could lose potential sales and existing customers our ability to deliver our services or operate our business may be impaired we may be subject to litigation or regulatory investigations or orders and we may incur significant liabilities we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches 

disruptions in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and any disruptions in our services could damage our customers businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results from time to time we experience defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may also result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any such adverse event despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our warranty provisions or service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

if we are unable to continuously enhance our products and services to deliver consumer productlike experiences mobility messaging and ease of use they could become less competitive or obsolete and our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

we believe that enterprises are increasingly focused on delivering a consumerlike technology experience to users within the enterprise such as employees and to individuals interacting with the enterprise such as customers partners and suppliers accordingly our ability to attract new customers and to renew and increase revenues from existing customers depends on our ability to continuously enhance our products and services and provide them in ways that are broadly accepted in particular we need to continuously modify and improve our products and services to keep pace with changes in user expectations including intuitive and attractive user interfaces use and mobility features messaging social networking and communication database hardware and security technologies if we are unable to consistently and timely meet these requirements our products and services may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

the markets in which we compete to manage services across the enterprise are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do furthermore third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition may acquire our current or potential competitors our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company international business machines corporation and salesforcecom further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings in the markets for it operations management customer service security incident management and use of our platform for service management outside of enterprise it we expect increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition to product and technology competition we face pricing competition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of employees which could disrupt our business our employees are generally employed on an atwill basis which means that our employees could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could have a serious impact on our business in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in particular competition for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities 

increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our services will depend to a significant extent on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers during the year ended december 31 2015  our sales and marketing organization increased from 1011  to 1416  employees we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals newly hired employees require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity particularly in new sales territories and our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we plan or at all further in our less established markets such as in brazil and various countries within asia we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing sales and marketing campaigns and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct such campaigns our business will be adversely affected if our sales and marketing expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenues 

our business depends substantially on our existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions from us and renewing their subscriptions upon expiration of their subscription term any decline in customer additional purchases or renewals would harm our business and operating results 

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our existing customers expand their use of our services by adding new users and applying our products and services in new ways across the enterprise and renew their subscriptions upon expiration of the subscription contract term our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and our customers may not renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of users although our renewal rates have historically been high some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates moreover in some cases some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the term our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers satisfaction with our products and services and customer support our prices and pricing policies and the prices of competing products and services mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base customer personnel changes global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels our renewal rates may also decline based on our customers’ satisfaction with the implementation and other professional services of our partners or the quality of implementations by our customers all of which are generally outside of our control if our customers do not renew their subscriptions renew on less favorable terms fail to add more authorized users fail to purchase additional professional services decline to act as enthusiastic reference accounts for our customer prospects or disparage our products and services our revenue growth rate business and operating results will be adversely affected 

our revenue growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance 

we depend on our channel partners including our implementation partners systems integrators managed services providers and sales partners in order to grow our business our sales efforts have focused on large enterprise customers and there are a limited number of partners with the capacity to provide these customers an effective level of services in order to continue our revenue growth we need to recruit these partners and these partners need to devote substantial resources to our solutions accordingly we need to build services implement partner programs and provide training and other resources to recruit retain and enable these partners our agreements with partners are typically nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing solutions our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their solutions or otherwise disrupt the relationships we have with our partners in addition global economic conditions could harm the businesses of our partners and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the additional resources we expect to the relationship if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with our channel partners our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer to compete in the markets for our newly introduced products in the markets for it operations management customer service security incident management and use of our platform for service management outside of enterprise it we may need to establish relationships with additional sales and implementation partners further reliance on third parties exposes us to risk of poor performance and failed customer expectations if our channel partners do not effectively provide services or support to the satisfaction of our endcustomers we may incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction could damage our reputation or ability to obtain additional revenues from that customer or prospective customers 

privacy laws and concerns evolving regulation of cloud computing and the changes in laws regulations and standards related to the internet may cause our business to suffer 

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas changing laws regulations and standards applying to the solicitation collection transfer processing storage or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services and in some cases could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally for example the european court of justice in october 2015 issued a ruling immediately invalidating the useu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which facilitated the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states in compliance with applicable european data protection laws while other adequate legal mechanisms for lawfully transferring european personal data to the united states remain there is regulatory uncertainty surrounding how data transfers from the european economic area to the united states will be authorized in the future future laws regulations standards and other obligations and changes in the interpretation of existing laws regulations standards and other obligations could impair our or our customers’ ability to collect use or disclose information relating to individuals which could decrease demand for our applications require us to restrict our business operations increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet commerce conducted via the internet or validation that particular processes follow the latest standards these changes could limit the viability of cloud computing services such as ours if we are not able to adjust to changing laws regulations and standards related to the internet our business may be adversely affected 

prospective customers that have not yet embraced cloud computing solutions may continue to be reluctant slow or unwilling to do so any of which could harm our business and operating results 

we do not know whether the trend of adoption of enterprise cloud computing solutions from which we have benefited in the past will continue in the future at the same overall growth rates many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate enterprise software into their businesses over time and some have been reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud computing solutions furthermore some organizations have been reluctant or unwilling to use cloud computing solutions because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security of their data the physical location of data centers in which their data is stored and processed and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions in addition if either we or other cloud computing providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for cloud computing solutions as a whole including for our products and services will be negatively impacted for these and other reasons there is a substantial risk that enterprises including global 2000 enterprises on which we are dependent for sales growth that have not yet embraced cloud computing solutions will continue to be reluctant slow or be unwilling to do so or willing to do so only to a limited extent any of which could harm our business 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results 

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar can affect our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings for example the us dollar has strengthened relative to the euro and other currencies in the past year this has and if this trend continues it will continue to negatively impact our consolidated revenues it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods 

we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies however in the future we may use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place moreover the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments 

because we recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions as a result most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small and perhaps no apparent impact on our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenues in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of earnings and losses in differing jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

our tax provision could be impacted by changes in federal state or international tax laws or tax rulings for example the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings in addition many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws certain proposals or newly enacted laws include provisions that could significantly increase our tax obligations in some countries these changes in taxation may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

we may acquire or invest in companies and technologies which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments 

as part of our business strategy we have acquired companies in the past and may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies an acquisition investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in particular we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership management or otherwise 

negotiating these transactions can be timeconsuming difficult and expensive and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control consequently these transactions even if undertaken and announced may not close for one or more of those transactions we may 

 17 

 

acquisitions or other strategic investments may also disrupt our business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities 

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

our sales cycles are long and if they lengthen further or if our substantial upfront sales investments do not result in sufficient sales our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers because these customers are often making an enterprisewide decision to deploy our services sometimes on a global basis we face long and variable sales cycles complex customer requirements substantial upfront presales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales our sales cycle is generally six to nine months but is variable and difficult to predict and can be much longer furthermore large enterprises often undertake a prolonged evaluation of our services including whether they need professional services performed by us or a third party for their service management needs and a comparison of our services to products offered by our competitors some of our large enterprise customers initially deploy our services on a limited basis with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our services widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial presales investment if our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront presales investments do not result in sufficient subscription revenues to justify our investments our operating results could be adversely affected 

sales to customers outside north america expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

because we sell our services throughout the world we are subject to risks that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in north america the business conduct and ethical standards of many other countries including the emerging market countries that we are expanding into are substantially different and much less rigorous than the united states risks inherent with international sales include without limitation 

 18 

 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under a combination of patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other jurisdictions though we seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be adversely affected 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

our products incorporate software licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses and we may continue to incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and would cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by high levels of bad debt globally geopolitical instability slowing economic growth in china falling demand for a variety of goods and services including oil and other commodities high levels of persistent unemployment and wage and income stagnation in some geographic markets restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results in addition the effects if any of global financial conditions on our business can be difficult to distinguish from the effects on our business from product pricing and other developments in the markets specific to our products and our relative competitive strength if we make incorrect judgments about our business for this reason our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our 0 convertible senior notes due 2018 or the notes 

although the notes are referred to as convertible senior notes they are effectively subordinated to any of our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries 

the notes will rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up our assets that secure debt ranking senior in right of payment to the notes will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all claims senior to the notes have been repaid in full there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the notes then outstanding the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt nor does it prohibit any of our current or future subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities 

as of december 31 2015  we and our subsidiaries had 4745 million  in consolidated indebtedness and our subsidiaries had 2316 million  of liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with gaap to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated 

recent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the notes 

we expect that many investors in and potential purchasers of the notes will employ or seek to employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the notes investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the notes investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock 

the sec and other regulatory and selfregulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities including our common stock such rules and actions include rule 201 of sec regulation sho the adoption by the financial industry regulatory authority inc and the national securities exchanges of a “limit uplimit down” program the imposition of marketwide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in or potential purchasers of the notes to effect short sales of our common stock borrow our common stock or enter into swaps on our common stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the notes 

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would diminish our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes 

holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

in may 2008 financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement which has subsequently been codified as accounting standards codification 47020 debt with conversion and other options or asc 47020 under asc 47020 an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of asc 47020 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we are required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we will report lower net income or larger net losses in our financial results because asc 47020 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s nonconvertible coupon interest rate which could adversely affect our future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent our conversion obligation includes shares of our common stock 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock including without limitation voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock prior to the conversion date relating to such notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion but holders of notes will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock for example if an amendment is proposed to our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the conversion date related to a holder’s conversion of its notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion such holder will not be entitled to vote on the amendment although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our common stock 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in note holders receiving less than the value of our common stock into which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 1 2018 holders of our notes may convert their notes only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the cash common stock or a combination of cash and common stock as applicable into which their notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes note holders may receive less valuable consideration than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after holders exercise their conversion right but before we settle our conversion obligation 

under the notes a converting holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our common stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation 

upon conversion of the notes we have the option to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock the amount of consideration that a note holder will receive upon conversion of such holder’s notes will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for each trading day in a 30 tradingday observation period this period would be i if the relevant conversion date occurs prior to july 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the second trading day immediately succeeding such conversion date and ii if the relevant conversion date occurs during the period from and including july 1 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding november 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the 32nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the amount andor value of consideration note holders receive will be adversely affected in addition if the market price of our common stock at the end of such period is below the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock during such period the value of any shares of our common stock that note holders will receive in satisfaction of our conversion obligation will be less than the value used to determine the number of shares that holders will receive 

if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes we will be required to deliver the shares of our common stock together with cash for any fractional share on the third business day following the relevant conversion date or for conversions occurring on or after july 1 2018 on the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the value of the shares that holders receive will be adversely affected and would be less than the conversion value of the notes on the conversion date 

the notes are not protected by restrictive covenants 

the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries the indenture contains no covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us except in certain cases described in the indenture connected with fundamental changes consolidations mergers or sales of assets 

the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders of the notes for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction 

if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under certain circumstances we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of our common stock for notes converted in connection with such makewhole fundamental change the increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid or deemed to be paid per share of our common stock in such transaction the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction in addition if the price of our common stock in the transaction is greater than 25000 per share or less than 5373 per share in each case subject to adjustment no additional shares will be added to the conversion rate moreover in no event will the conversion rate per 1000 principal amount of notes as a result of this adjustment exceed 186115 shares of common stock subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate 

our obligation to increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change could be considered a penalty in which case the enforceability thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness and equitable remedies 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment for certain events including but not limited to the issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as a thirdparty tender or exchange offer or an issuance of common stock for cash that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or our common stock an event that adversely affects the value of the notes may occur and that event may not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate 

provisions in the indenture for the notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to note holders 

if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes holders of the notes will have the right at their option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes in addition if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change furthermore the indenture for the notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to note holders 

some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a fundamental change in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the notes 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change note holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes however the fundamental change provisions will not afford protection to holders of notes in the event of other transactions that could adversely affect the notes for example transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations refinancings restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a fundamental change requiring us to offer to repurchase the notes in the event of any such transaction the holders would not have the right to require us to repurchase the notes even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings thereby adversely affecting the holders of notes 

in addition absent the occurrence of a fundamental change or a makewhole fundamental change changes in the composition of our board of directors will not provide holders with the right to require us to repurchase the notes or to an increase in the conversion rate upon conversion 

we have not registered the notes or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any which will limit the ability of note holders to resell them 

the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act or any state securities laws unless the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have been registered they may not be transferred or resold except in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws we do not intend to file a registration statement for the resale of the notes and the common stock if any into which the notes are convertible 

we cannot guarantee an active trading market for the notes 

we have not listed and do not intend to apply to list the notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system moreover the initial purchasers of the notes may cease making a market in the notes at any time without notice in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally as a result we cannot assure note holders that there will be an active trading market for the notes if an active trading market is not maintained the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected in that case note holders might not be able to sell the notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

any adverse rating of the notes may cause their trading price to fall 

we have not obtained and do not intend to seek a rating on the notes however if a rating service were to rate the notes and if such rating service were to lower its rating on the notes below the rating initially assigned to the notes or otherwise announces its intention to put the notes on credit watch the trading price of the notes could decline 

note holders may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the notes even though note holders do not receive a corresponding cash distribution 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including the payment of cash dividends if the conversion rate is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to our common stockholders such as a cash dividend note holders may be deemed to have received a dividend subject to us federal income tax without the receipt of any cash in addition a failure to adjust or to adjust adequately the conversion rate after an event that increases a note holder’s proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to such note holder if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under some circumstances we will increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with the makewhole fundamental change such increase may also be treated as a distribution subject to us federal income tax as a dividend if a holder is a nonus holder any deemed dividend generally would be subject to us federal withholding tax at a 30 rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty which may be set off against subsequent payments on the notes 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the notes 

in the future we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options the vesting of restricted stock settlement of restricted stock units and issuance of performance shares pursuant to our employee benefit plans for purchase by employees under our employee stock purchase plan upon conversion of the notes and in relation to the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of the notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge or note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions the “option counterparties” we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock or warrants the note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile could adversely impact the trading price of the notes and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

  

 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us a decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of our notes the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock this trading activity could in turn affect the trading price of the notes some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

  

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents delaware law and our notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the notes

we intend to vigorously defend against hpe’s and bmcs lawsuits the final outcome with respect to the claims in the lawsuits including our liability if any is uncertain furthermore we cannot be certain that any claims by hpe or bmc would be resolved in our favor for example an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us could result in injunctive relief could result in a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments and could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us moreover to the extent we are found to infringe on any valid claims asserted against us our attempt to modify our products so that they are no longer infringing may be unsuccessful could cause us to incur substantial expense could be a distraction to management and any such modified products may not be well received in the market to the extent that we reach a negotiated settlement the settlement could require that we pay substantial royalties and could require that we make modifications to our products that may not be well received in the market 

at this stage in these litigation matters any possible monetary loss or range of monetary loss cannot be estimated the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period or settled on unfavorable terms our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

overview 

  

servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define structure manage and automate services across the global enterprise our mission is to help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable by applying a serviceoriented lens to the activities tasks and processes that comprise daytoday work life our solutions and the custom solutions built by our customers and partners are empowering enterprises to change the way people work we offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users we generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

  

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 3686  as of december 31 2015  from 2826  as of december 31 2014  

  

key factors affecting our performance 

  

renewal rate  we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annualized contract value or acv from lost customers divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period excluding changes in price or users and total acv from all lost customers a lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring that in our judgment will not be renewed typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customers acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer our renewal rate was 98  97  and 96  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

upsell rate  to grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers which we refer to as our upsell rate we calculate our upsell rate as the acv of upsells net of losses and reductions in acv from existing customers during the period divided by our total acv signed during the period our upsell rate was 38  43  and 39  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we expect our upsell rate to decrease in the long term as our renewal base continues to grow 

our upsells are primarily derived from an increase in the number of user seats purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services in the first quarter of 2015 we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking refer to the “total customers” paragraph below for further details about the change the change in customer count definition increased the upsell rate we had disclosed in the prior year from 36 to 43 for the year ended december 31 2014 and from 31 to 39 for the year ended december 31 2013 

total customers  we believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration growth and future revenues we have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force and partnerships with our indirect sales channel in order to grow our customer base based on our new definition of customer count as described below our total enterprise customer count was approximately 3000  2300  and 1800  as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 400 customers that have purchased our express product offering “express customers” which is our entrylevel it service management solution our express customer count as of december 31 2014 and 2013 was less than 100 

in the first quarter of 2015 we changed our definition of customer count to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking previously we generally defined a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date in situations where a single contract applied to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions universities or governmental organizations each entity that contracted for a separate production instance of our services was counted as a separate customer beginning on january 1 2015 a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn  bradstreet global ultimate or gult data universal numbering system or duns and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking we will make exceptions for holding companies government entities and other organizations for which the gult in our judgment does not accurately represent the servicenow customer for example while all us government agencies roll up to government of the united states under the gult we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer 

the change in customer count definition reduced our enterprise customer count by approximately 14  and 12  as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we did not previously disclose our express customer count as the enterprise customer definition is a factor used in the calculation of other metrics we disclose upsell rate number of customers with acv greater than 1 million number of deals with net new acv greater than 1 million and average contract term for new customers upsells and renewals we have revised previously disclosed numbers for the impacted metrics to ensure comparability across the periods 

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 230  153  and 81  customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the change in customer count definition increased the total number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2014 from 129  to 153  for the year ended december 31 2014 and from 67  to 81  for the year ended december 31 2013 

the number of deals with net new acv greater than 1 million entered into during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were 36  34  and 15  respectively we define net new acv as acv from new customers and upsells to existing customers net of losses to those customers the change in customer count definition decreased the total number of deals with acv greater than 1 million we had disclosed in the prior year from 36  to 34  for the year ended december 31 2014 and increased the total number of deals with acv greater than 1 million from 14  to 15  for the year ended december 31 2013 

g2k customer count   the global 2000 or g2k customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics sales profit assets and market value the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity to ensure the g2k customer count is accurately captured for example we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company or any of its related subsidiaries or any combination of entities within a g2k company we count only one g2k customer we do not count further penetration into entities within the g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count our g2k customer count based on the most recent forbes global 2000 and adjusted for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity was 638  538  and 445  as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

average acv per g2k customer  we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking cumulative acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the cumulative count of g2k customers as of the end of the period our average acv per g2k customer was approximately 868000  711000  and 515000  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

billings  we define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into us dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate and is a better approximation of actual billings as it is more aligned with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings we believe billings offers investors useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volume and performance of our business 

a calculation of billings is provided below 



our international operations provide a significant portion of our total billings and revenues as a result the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily the euro from the year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2015  had an unfavorable impact on our billings and revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2015  at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2014  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our total billings would have increased by an additional 743 million  with 601 million  of the increase relating to an increase in total revenues and 142 million  of the increase relating to the change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows 

the impact of currency movement from the year ended december 31 2013  to the year ended december 31 2014  did not have a significant impact on billings and revenues 

average contract term  we calculate the average contract term for new customers upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv the average new customer contract term was 31  months 32  months and 34  months for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the average upsell contract term was 26  months 25  months and 24  months for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the average renewal contract term was 24  months for the year ended december 31 2015  and 26  months for each of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  

in the first quarter of 2015 we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking refer to the “total customers” paragraph section above for further details of the change the change in customer count definition decreased the average new customer contract term from 34  months as disclosed in the prior year to 32  months for the year ended december 31 2014  and increased the average new customer contract term from 33  months as previously disclosed to 34  months for the year ended december 31 2013  the change in customer count increased the average upsell contract term from 24  months as disclosed in the prior year to 25  months for the year ended december 31 2014  the change in customer count definition had no impact to our disclosures in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2014 for the average upsell for the year ended december 31 2013  and the average renewal contract term for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  

free cash flow we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment we believe information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to invest in our business and fund ongoing operations however our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies a calculation of free cash flow is provided below

comparison of the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014   

  

revenues 

  



  

subscription revenues increased 2811 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year driven by our upsells renewals and an increase in our customer count 

subscription revenues consist of the following 



our enterprise service management solutions include service management business management and servicenow platform which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis our it operations management solutions which improve visibility availability and agility of enterprise services are generally priced on a per node basis we expect subscription revenues for our it operations management solutions to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31   2016  

professional services and other revenues increased 419 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to 109 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to 82 million  in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year we expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery 

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues revenues outside north america represented 30  and 32  of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively as a result the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies primarily euro from the year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2015  had an unfavorable impact on our revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31 2015  at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2014  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional 480 million  and our professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional 120 million  

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 

  



  

cost of subscription revenues increased 407 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 112 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 84 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 60 million  in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of 60 million  in other overhead expenses data center capacity costs increased 10 million  primarily due to the expansion of our data centers amortization of intangible assets increased 48 million  as a result of the acquisition of neebula systems ltd or neebula in july 2014 

our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 78  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 75  for the year ended december 31 2014  due to data center density and improved economies of scale we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31   2016  as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired our forecast for revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2015  

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 399 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 112 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 101 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 53 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 132 million  in contracted thirdparty party costs 

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 7  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to 8  in the prior year due to increased stockbased compensation the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 109 million  or 7  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31   2015  knowledge contributed 82 million  or 7  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31 2014  

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended   december 31 2014  to the year ended   december 31 2015  had an impact on our cost of revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended   december 31 2015  at the exchange rates for the year ended   december 31 2014  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended   december 31 2015  our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional 80 million  and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional 78 million  

  

sales and marketing 

  



  

sales and marketing expenses increased 1573 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of 577 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 483 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 190 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 153 million  in commission expense commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 8  and 10  of subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

in addition expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased 57 million  from 153 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  to 210 million  for the year ended   december 31 2015  due to a 31  increase in attendance yearoveryear all other marketing program expenses which include events advertising and market data increased 102 million  for the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended   december 31 2014  to the year ended   december 31 2015  had an impact on our sales and marketing expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended   december 31 2015  at the exchange rates for the year ended   december 31 2014  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional 209 million  

we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2016  in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 

research and development 

  



  

research and development expenses increased 691 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of 278 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 254 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation and an increase of 106 million  in overhead expenses research and development expenses also increased 35 million  due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended   december 31 2014  to the year ended   december 31 2015  had an impact on our research and development expenses for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar if we had translated our results for the year ended   december 31 2015  at the exchange rates for the year ended   december 31 2014  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended   december 31 2015  our research and development expenses would have increased by an additional 42 million  

  

we expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2016  in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

general and administrative expenses increased 304 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase of 142 million  in outside services primarily driven by an increase in legal fees associated with our litigation and an increase in the number of contractors to support our administrative functions in addition stockbased compensation increased 87 million  and personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation increased 74 million  primarily driven by the increased headcount 

 the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended   december 31 2014  to the year ended   december 31 2015  is not material to general and administrative expenses 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2016  in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people and incur costs associated with our litigations but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow this includes anticipated attorney’s fees and expenses for our outstanding litigations with bmc and hpe but not any forecast related to their outcomes the trials are currently scheduled for march 2016 and may 2017 respectively refer to “legal proceedings” in item 3 of this filing for details on the litigation matters 

  

stockbased compensation 

  



stockbased compensation increased 1034 million during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to additional annual grants of equity incentive awards increased headcount an increase in the weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards and performance rsus granted to our executives in the current year the new equity incentive awards granted in the current year including the performance rsus resulted in an increase of 1021 million  in stockbased compensation the weightedaverage grant date exercise price per stock option share was 7576  and 6140  for the year ended   december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the weightedaverage grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was 7398  and 6113  for the year ended   december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

stockbased compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price and the uncertainty around the achievement of performance criteria associated with our performance rsus we expect stockbased compensation to continue to increase for the year ended   december 31   2016  in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

interest expense 



interest expense increased 20 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes or the notes issued in november 2013 during the year ended december 31 2016  we expect to incur approximately 333 million  in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



interest income and other expense net decreased 09 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower foreign currency gain partially offset by increased interest income our foreign currency exchange gain decreased  24 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations interest income increased 18 million  due to the higher investment balances during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the prior year 

our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

  

  provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 3  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2  for the prior year our tax expense increased 16 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 

net loss 



net loss increased 190 million  during the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to the prior year as the growth in our expenses particularly stockbased compensation exceeded our revenue growth we expect to continue to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31   2016  due to increased costs and expenses including increased noncash charges associated with equity awards and amortization of intangibles and other expenses 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 8 during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 10 in the prior year due to increased stockbased compensation the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 82 million or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2014 knowledge contributed 50 million in revenue or 6 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2013 

  

sales and marketing

stockbased compensation increased 887 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount an increase in the weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards and performance rsus granted to our executives in the current year the new equity incentive awards granted in the current year including the performance rsus resulted in an increase of 751 million in stockbased compensation the weightedaverage grant date exercise price per stock option share was 6140 and 3807 for the year ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the weightedaverage grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was 6113 and 3815 for the year ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in addition stockbased compensation increased 199 million related to equity incentive awards granted in the prior year for which a partial year of expense was recognized in the prior year and 24 million related to increased participation in our employee stock purchase plan the increase in stockbased compensation was partially offset by stock awards forfeited in the current year and stock awards fully vesting in the current year 

interest expense 



interest expense increased 256 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



interest income and other income expense net increased 68 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to a gain from foreign currency transactions and increased interest income we had a foreign currency transaction gain of 25 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to a loss of 25 million for the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations interest income increased 19 million due to the higher investment balances during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year

our effective tax rate was 2 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 4 for the prior year our tax expense increased 13 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

net loss 



net loss increased 1057 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year as the growth in our expenses particularly stockbased compensation exceeded our revenue growth 

quarterly results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

  

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality in our billings is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers we have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended september 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended june 30 our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  



  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2015  we had 8013 million in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 923 million  represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries in addition we had 4227 million  in longterm investments which provide additional capital resources 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million and concurrently entered into a hedge or note hedge and warrant transaction or warrants the net proceeds of this debt issuance are being used for general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions the warrants are exercisable at a strike price of 10746 per share upon conversion of the notes we may choose to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock as of december 31 2015  the notes were not convertible 

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing 

  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net loss adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization amortization of issuance cost and debt discount stockbased compensation tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3151 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 1389 million  for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31 2015  net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30  for the year ended december 31 2015  as well as timing of our cash payments 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 817 million for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 54 for the year ended december 31 2014 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2015  was 2317 million  compared to 3169 million  for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the 320 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the 987 million  decrease in cash used for acquisitions offset by the 331 million  increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth and the 105 million  increase in the purchases of strategic investments 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014 was 3169 million compared to 4028 million for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of 1713 million the decrease was offset by an increase of 865 million in acquisition activity due to the neebula acquisition in 2014 

  financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended   december 31 2015  was 830 million  compared to 708 million  for the prior year the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the 240 million  increase in proceeds from employee stock plans offset by the 121 million  increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014 was 708 million compared to 5686 million for the prior year the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of 5117 million from issuance of the notes and warrants and purchase of the note hedge in 2013 the decrease was offset by 132 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan or espp and related tax benefit 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 

the following table represents our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  aggregated by type 

  



in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 26 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2015  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of 02 million  and interest of 03 million  related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

  

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

  

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues from two sources i subscriptions and ii professional services and other subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates if any to the subscribed service during the subscription term 

our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge our annual user conference 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

• there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

• the service has been provided to the customer 

• the collection of related fees is reasonably assured and 

• the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

we use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer in subsequent transactions with an existing customer including an upsell or a renewal we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers once our services are available to customers we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue we price professional services primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model such services are delivered over a short period of time in instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met 

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements are generally noncancelable and do not contain refundtype provisions 

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us in addition the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development modification or customization we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term in determining whether professional services have standalone value we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services have standalone value 

the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price or besp we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and current pricing practices in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis 

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software we have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services consequently we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started to be delivered once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred commissions 

  

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related customer contracts we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized the commission payments are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform a twostep impairment test the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment under the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill we have determined that we have a single reporting unit since the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months  to 10 years  each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization we periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate if we consider any of these assets to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 

screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred including market conditions operating fundamentals competition and general economic conditions requires significant judgment additionally changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly therefore there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets impairment tests 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units or rsus on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years for rsus granted with a performance condition the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the espp on a straightline basis over the offering period we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an update to asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers or asc 606 that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance under this update an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services as such an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance this update should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings this update is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2018 early adoption is permitted for us on january 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs this new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts this guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance as of december 31 2015 on a retrospective basis as a result of the adoption we reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of 02 million and 03 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively from other assets and reflected them as a reduction in convertible senior notes net on the consolidated balance sheets adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss or consolidated statements of cash flows 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201505 intangibles—goodwill and other—internaluse software subtopic 35040 customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement asu 201505 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract the new guidance does not change the customer’s accounting for service contracts this guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2016 we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments topic 805 which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments asu 201516 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment including the impact on prior periods be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures as we do not have any business combinations within the measurement period 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes to simplify presentation the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet as a result each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability this guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance during the three months ended december 31 2015 on a prospective basis resulting in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets which decreased 155 million of other current assets and 152 million of other longterm liabilities and increased 03 million of other assets prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted 



  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 74  72  and 77  during the years ended december 31   2015  2014  and 2013  respectively changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our total revenues 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 01 million  and 25 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may do so in the future 

a hypothetical 10 decrease in the us dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately 24 million   decrease and 35 million increase in operating loss for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an aggregate of 12 billion  in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments at december 31 2015  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds time deposits corporate notes and bonds government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of bbb by standard  poors baa2 by moodys or bbb by fitch the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments as of december 31 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 74 million  decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

as of december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of 09 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate 56 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because this instrument does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates 

we hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we invested 105 million in privatelyheld companies that are in the development stage the fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value

overview 

servicenow is a leading provider of cloudbased solutions that define structure manage and automate services across the global enterprise by applying a serviceoriented lens to the activities tasks and processes that comprise daytoday work life we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before 

services are any of the varied and frequent transactions across an enterprise between a requester and a provider such as a request for a new cell phone asking about employer benefits a request to onboard a new employee reporting a facilities or information technology it problem or provisioning a new server or application these transactions can be internal to the enterprise or with outside parties such as customers suppliers or partners 

typically many of these interactions are through email phone or voicemail and are not systematically tracked or are tracked in spreadsheets or other disparate databases this lack of a single structured and persistent system to manage all enterprise services reduces efficiencies and limits scalability for example when services are delivered through email providers generally have no systematic view into what causes requests and how to reduce or eliminate them in addition the enterprise often gains little insight into team workloads service quality or how departments are faring against service level agreements further the lack of a single system to manage services within the enterprise can create a fragmentation of tools and databases that is difficult and expensive to manage leads to poor communication between departments and hinders or prevents compliance with reporting and other regulatory obligations 

to address these issues the it industry has developed a standard framework to define and automate it services among its attributes this model helps enterprises define and structure services and workflows provide an intuitive user experience and knowledge base implement service delivery establish service level agreements and provide analytics this service model improves it service quality efficiency and scalability and is a best practice that can be applied to other departments throughout the enterprise

competition 

  

the markets in which we compete to manage service across the enterprise are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services moreover as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we face and will face additional competition from platform vendors including salesforcecom and from application development vendors focused on these other markets 

the principal competitive factors in our industry include total cost of ownership product functionality breadth of offerings flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition we are seeking patent protection for our technology we pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our service offerings policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

companies in our industry own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights we currently face and we expect we will face in the future allegations that we have infringed the trademarks copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties including our competitors and nonpracticing entities as we face increasing competition and as our business grows we will likely face more claims of infringement for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of hewlettpackards patents hewlettpackard is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction on september 23 2014 bmc software inc filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas that alleges that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of seven of bmc’s patents bmc is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction for additional information see the sections entitled risk factors in item 1a and legal proceedings in item 3 of part i in this annual report

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

we expect our revenue growth rate to decline but we may not accurately predict the rate or magnitude of such decline our capacity is largely driven by production factors such as facilities data centers and a trained workforce that require long term investments and expense commitments which we cannot easily adjust in the short term as our costs increase we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to generate or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations 

  

from the year ended june 30 2009 to the year ended december 31 2014  our revenues grew from 193 million to 6826 million  we expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to decline into the foreseeable future we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity in order to support anticipated growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business even if our revenue continues to increase we expect to continue to incur a generally accepted accounting principles gaap loss during future periods due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may result in increased costs as a result we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations if we fail to grow our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our operating results will be harmed 

our quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance we give does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors our stock price could decline substantially 

  

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock or we fail to meet or exceed any forwardlooking financial guidance we have issued or if any forwardlooking financial guidance we give is below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock the price of our common stock could decline substantially some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter or which could impact any forwardlooking financial guidance we give for any period include 

  

 8 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we face cybersecurity risks including but not limited to unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data theft of proprietary information denial of service attacks loss or corruption of customer data and computer hacking attacks if any of these risks occur our reputation may be harmed our services may be perceived as not secure we may lose prospective customers existing customers may curtail or stop using our services our ability to operate our business may be impaired and we may incur significant liabilities 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive information including in some cases personally identifiable information protected health information proprietary intellectual property and credit card and other sensitive financial information we do not control or monitor the information that customers process in our services we are unaware of the type sensitivity and value of the customer information processed in our services and we do not vary our service offering and security measures due to the content of customer data we have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of customer data cybersecurity risks including but not limited to unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data theft of proprietary information denial of service attacks loss or corruption of customer data and computer hacking attacks could expose us to substantial litigation expenses and damages indemnity and other contractual obligations government fines and penalties mitigation expenses and other liability additionally unauthorized persons may obtain access to our own sensitive proprietary or confidential information or systems including our intellectual property and other confidential business information and our information technology systems such access could be used to compromise our competitive position our ability to deliver our services or our ability to manage and operate our business the security measures protecting our customers and our own information and systems could be breached as a result of third party action employee error or employee misconduct because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we could suffer severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed we could lose potential sales and existing customers our ability to operate our business may be impaired we may be subject to litigation or regulatory investigations or orders and we may incur significant liabilities we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches 

disruptions in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and any disruptions in our services could damage our customers businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results from time to time we have found defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may also result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any adverse event despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our reputation and business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our warranty provisions or service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

we depend on our senior management team and if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need to support our operations and growth our business could be harmed 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of employees which could disrupt our business our employees are generally employed on an atwill basis which means that our employees could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could have a serious impact on our business in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in particular competition for experienced software and cloudbased infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be harmed 

if we are not able to enhance our existing service develop new applications and promote our services for the development of custom applications our business and operating results could be harmed 

  

our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends on our ability to enhance our services and provide it in a way that is broadly accepted in particular we need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in user expectations including increased demand for intuitive and attractive user interfaces internet software practices and communication database hardware and security technologies in addition we must effectively make our services available in additional ways including on mobile devices if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid developments our services may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete our success also depends on our ability to develop new applications and promote our services for the development of custom applications we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from subscriptions to our suite of applications for use within it and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future we are expanding the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and mediumsized businesses the success of any enhancement or new application and the success of our efforts to promote the use of our services for development of custom applications depends on several factors including timely completion adequate quality testing introduction and market acceptance any new service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner may not be priced appropriately and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues for instance from time to time we have changed the way that we price and package our services and we anticipate that we will continue to make periodic adjustments to our pricing and packaging in the future and prospective or existing customers may not accept any new pricing or services packaging we have adopted or may adopt in the future in addition sales of new services may erode sales of our existing similar services if we are unable to enhance our existing service successfully develop new applications or promote the use of our services for the development of custom applications our business and operating results could be harmed 

we may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements 

  

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the expanding needs of our customers as their use of our services grows we expect the number of users and transactions we manage the amount of data we transfer process and store the number of locations from which our services are being accessed and the number of processes and systems we manage to continue to grow in the past a few of our largest customers experienced reduced levels of availability performance and functionality due to the scale at which they implemented our services in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers we intend to continue making significant investments to develop and implement new technologies in our services and cloudbased infrastructure operations these technologies which include databases applications and server optimizations network and hosting strategies and automation are often advanced complex new and untested we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies in addition it takes a significant amount of time to plan develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements we are also dependent upon open source and other thirdparty technologies and may be unable to quickly effect changes to such technologies which may prevent us from rapidly responding to evolving customer requirements to the extent that we do not effectively scale our services and operations to meet the growing needs of our customers we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate our customers may reduce or cancel use of our services we may be unable to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

  

the markets in which we compete to manage services across the enterprise are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for service management matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging cloud and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services moreover as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we will face additional competition from platform vendors including salesforcecom inc and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition to product and technology competition we face pricing competition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

we may acquire or invest in companies which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments 

  

we have acquired companies in the past and may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies an acquisition investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in particular we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership management or otherwise 

  

negotiating these transactions can be timeconsuming difficult and expensive and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control consequently these transactions even if undertaken and announced may not close for one or more of those transactions we may 

  

 

acquisitions may also disrupt our business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities for example in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of a privatelyheld company based in israel neebula systems ltd or neebula to succeed with this acquisition we need to successfully retain neebula’s key personnel and implement neebula’s technology on the servicenow platform we may experience difficulties in this integration due to differences in operations technology and culture between servicenow and neebula and other challenges associated with operating a business in a geography in which we did not previously have substantial engineering operations and which is currently involved in regional conflicts 

if the market for our technology delivery model develops more slowly than we expect our growth may slow or stall and our operating results would be harmed 

  

use of cloudbased applications to automate and manage service relationships is at an early stage we do not know whether the trend of adoption of enterprise cloudbased solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future in particular many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy software into their businesses over time and some have been reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloudbased solutions furthermore some organizations particularly large enterprises upon which we are dependent have been reluctant or unwilling to use cloudbased solutions because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security of their data the physical location of data centers in which their data is stored and processed and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions it is possible that various governmental jurisdictions around the world in which we compete will adopt laws regarding access to the processing of or the location of storage of data that prevents or imposes prohibitively expensive hurdles for us to provide our cloudbased solutions to enterprises within such jurisdictions in addition if either we or other cloudbased providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for cloudbased solutions as a whole including our services will be negatively impacted if the adoption of cloudbased solutions does not continue the market for these solutions may stop developing or may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would harm our operating results 

failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our services 

  

increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our services will depend to a significant extent on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 our sales and marketing organization increased from 615  to 1011  employees we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals further new hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity particularly in new sales territories and our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we plan or at all moreover we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas sales and marketing campaigns and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct such campaigns our business will be harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenues 

our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance 

  

we depend on various third parties such as implementation partners systems integrators managed services providers and sales partners in order to grow our business our sales efforts have focused on large enterprise customers and there are a limited number of partners with the capacity to provide these customers a significant level of services in order to continue our growth we need to recruit these partners and these partners need to devote substantial resources to our solutions accordingly we need to build services implement partner programs and provide training and other resources to recruit retain and enable these partners our agreements with partners are typically nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing solutions our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their solutions or otherwise disrupt the relationships we have with our partners in addition global economic conditions could harm the businesses of our partners and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the additional resources we expect to the relationship if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we may need to establish relationships with additional sales and implementation partners further reliance on third parties exposes us to risk of poor performance and failed customer expectations if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by a third party we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction could damage our reputation or ability to obtain additional revenues from that customer or prospective customers 

our business depends substantially on our existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions from us and renewing their subscriptions upon expiration of the subscription term any decline in customer additional purchases or renewals would harm our operating results 

  

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our existing customers expand their use of our service by adding new users and new applications of our service across the enterprise and renew their subscriptions upon expiration of the subscription contract term our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and our customers may not renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of users although our renewal rates have historically been high some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates moreover in some cases some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the term our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers satisfaction with our subscription service professional services customer support or prices the prices of competing solutions mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base the effects of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels our growth also depends in part on our ability to sell more subscriptions and additional professional services to our current customers if our customers do not renew their subscriptions renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more authorized users or fail to purchase additional professional services our revenues may decline and our operating results would be harmed 

because our sales efforts are targeted at large enterprise customers we face longer sales cycles substantial upfront presales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales if our sales cycle lengthens or if our sales investments do not result in sufficient sales our operating results could be harmed 

  

we target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers because these customers are often making an enterprisewide decision to deploy our services sometimes on a global basis we face long sales cycles complex customer requirements substantial upfront presales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales our sales cycle is generally six to nine months but is variable and difficult to predict and can be much longer large enterprises often undertake a prolonged evaluation of our services including whether they need professional services performed by us or a third party for their service management needs and a comparison of our services to products offered by our competitors some of our large enterprise customers initially deploy our services on a limited basis with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our services widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial presales investment if our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront presales investments do not result in sufficient subscription revenues to justify our investments our operating results could be harmed 

we may be unable to develop or obtain intellectual property that provides us with a competitive advantage or prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights we have recently begun to seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be harmed 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

  

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry our success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or services from time to time our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights 

  

for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of hewlettpackards patents hewlettpackard is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction we filed an answer to the complaint on march 28 2014 denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses the court held case management conferences on june 26 2014 september 4 2014 and february 5 2015 the parties are currently conducting discovery hewlettpackard served infringement contentions on july 3 2014 and november 18 2014 we served invalidity contentions on january 9 2015 a claim construction hearing is scheduled for june 12 2015 trial is currently scheduled to begin on may 16 2016 we have filed petitions for inter partes  review of all eight asserted patents with the united states patent and trademark office 

on september 23 2014 bmc software inc filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas that alleges that some of our services willfully infringe the claims of seven of bmc’s patents bmc is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction motions to dismiss and transfer venue are currently pending bmc served infringement contentions on january 6 2015 our invalidity contentions are due march 3 2015 a claim construction hearing is scheduled for july 10 2015 trial is currently scheduled to begin on march 14 2016 

we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits these litigation matters are still in their early stages and the final outcome including our liability if any with respect to the claims in the lawsuits is uncertain if an unfavorable outcome were to occur in either litigation the impact could be material to our business financial condition cash flow or results of operations depending on the specific circumstances of the outcome 

any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses modify our services or refund fees such disputes could also cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and could cause us to lose potential sales even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our operating results 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

  

a significant portion of the technologies licensed or developed by us incorporate open source software and we may incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

we need to continue to invest in the growth of our worldwide operations by opening new geographic markets if our required investments in these markets are greater than anticipated or if our customer growth in these markets does not meet our expectations our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

we are continuing to expand worldwide and have recently significantly expanded our presence in brazil and asia we have made and will continue to make substantial investments as we enter these and other new geographic markets these include investments in data centers and cloudbased infrastructure sales marketing and administrative personnel and facilities often we must make these investments when it is still unclear whether future sales in the new market will justify the investments in addition these investments may be more expensive than we initially anticipate if our required investments are greater than anticipated or if our customer growth does not meet our expectations our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

sales to customers outside north america expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

  

because we sell our services throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in north america sales outside of north america represented 32  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside north america are different in some ways from those associated with sales in north america and we have a limited history addressing those risks and meeting those challenges furthermore the business conduct and ethical standards of many other countries including the emerging market countries that we are expanding into are substantially different and much less rigorous than the united states the risks and challenges inherent with international sales include 

  

 longer and potentially more complex sales cycles 

 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

because we recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions as a result most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small and perhaps no apparent impact on our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenues in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

we face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  

we conduct significant transactions including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar can affect our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings for example the us dollar has recently begun to strengthen relative to the euro and other currencies if this trend continues it would have a negative impact on our consolidated revenues it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is a risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods 

we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies however in the future we may use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place moreover the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments 

  

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future results 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of earnings and losses in differing jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

  

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloudbased companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

  

the sarbanesoxley act requires us among other things to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses 

changes in laws regulations and standards related to the internet may cause our business to suffer 

  

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy the use of the internet as a commercial medium and data sovereignty requirements concerning the location of data centers that store and process data industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area for instance we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and changing laws regulations and standards applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet commerce conducted via the internet or validation that particular processes follow the latest standards these changes could limit the viability of internetbased services such as ours if we are not able to adjust to changing laws regulations and standards related to the internet our business may be harmed 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

  

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and would cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

  

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

  

risks related to our 0 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes 

although the notes are referred to as convertible senior notes they are effectively subordinated to any of our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries 

the notes will rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up our assets that secure debt ranking senior in right of payment to the notes will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all claims senior to the notes have been repaid in full there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the notes then outstanding the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt nor does it prohibit any of our current or future subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities 

as of december 31 2014 we and our subsidiaries had 4438 million  in consolidated indebtedness and our subsidiaries had 1628 million  of liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with gaap to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated 

recent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the notes 

we expect that many investors in and potential purchasers of the notes will employ or seek to employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the notes investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the notes investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock 

the sec and other regulatory and selfregulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities including our common stock such rules and actions include rule 201 of sec regulation sho the adoption by the financial industry regulatory authority inc and the national securities exchanges of a “limit uplimit down” program the imposition of marketwide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in or potential purchasers of the notes to effect short sales of our common stock borrow our common stock or enter into swaps on our common stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the notes 

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would diminish our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes 

holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

in may 2008 fasb issued fasb staff position no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement which has subsequently been codified as accounting standards codification 47020 debt with conversion and other options “asc 47020” under asc 47020 an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of asc 47020 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we are required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we will report lower net income or larger net losses in our financial results because asc 47020 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s nonconvertible coupon interest rate which could adversely affect our future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent our conversion obligation includes shares of our common stock 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock including without limitation voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock prior to the conversion date relating to such notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion but holders of notes will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock for example if an amendment is proposed to our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the conversion date related to a holder’s conversion of its notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion such holder will not be entitled to vote on the amendment although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our common stock 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in note holders receiving less than the value of our common stock into which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 1 2018 holders of our notes may convert their notes only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the cash common stock or a combination of cash and common stock as applicable into which their notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes note holders may receive less valuable consideration than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after holders exercise their conversion right but before we settle our conversion obligation 

under the notes a converting holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our common stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation 

upon conversion of the notes we have the option to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock the amount of consideration that a note holder will receive upon conversion of such holder’s notes will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for each trading day in a 30 tradingday observation period this period would be i if the relevant conversion date occurs prior to july 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the second trading day immediately succeeding such conversion date and ii if the relevant conversion date occurs during the period from and including july 1 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding november 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the 32nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the amount andor value of consideration note holders receive will be adversely affected in addition if the market price of our common stock at the end of such period is below the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock during such period the value of any shares of our common stock that note holders will receive in satisfaction of our conversion obligation will be less than the value used to determine the number of shares that holders will receive 

if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes we will be required to deliver the shares of our common stock together with cash for any fractional share on the third business day following the relevant conversion date or for conversions occurring on or after july 1 2018 on the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the value of the shares that holders receive will be adversely affected and would be less than the conversion value of the notes on the conversion date 

the notes are not protected by restrictive covenants 

the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries the indenture contains no covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us except in certain cases described in the indenture connected with fundamental changes consolidations mergers or sales of assets 

the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders of the notes for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction 

if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under certain circumstances we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of our common stock for notes converted in connection with such makewhole fundamental change the increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid or deemed to be paid per share of our common stock in such transaction the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction in addition if the price of our common stock in the transaction is greater than 25000 per share or less than 5373 per share in each case subject to adjustment no additional shares will be added to the conversion rate moreover in no event will the conversion rate per 1000 principal amount of notes as a result of this adjustment exceed 186115 shares of common stock subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate 

our obligation to increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change could be considered a penalty in which case the enforceability thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness and equitable remedies 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment for certain events including but not limited to the issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as a thirdparty tender or exchange offer or an issuance of common stock for cash that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or our common stock an event that adversely affects the value of the notes may occur and that event may not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate 

provisions in the indenture for the notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to note holders 

if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes holders of the notes will have the right at their option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes in addition if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change furthermore the indenture for the notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to note holders 

some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a fundamental change in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the notes 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change note holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes however the fundamental change provisions will not afford protection to holders of notes in the event of other transactions that could adversely affect the notes for example transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations refinancings restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a fundamental change requiring us to offer to repurchase the notes in the event of any such transaction the holders would not have the right to require us to repurchase the notes even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings thereby adversely affecting the holders of notes 

in addition absent the occurrence of a fundamental change or a makewhole fundamental change changes in the composition of our board of directors will not provide holders with the right to require us to repurchase the notes or to an increase in the conversion rate upon conversion 

we have not registered the notes or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any which will limit the ability of note holders to resell them 

the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act or any state securities laws unless the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have been registered they may not be transferred or resold except in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws we do not intend to file a registration statement for the resale of the notes and the common stock if any into which the notes are convertible 

we cannot guarantee an active trading market for the notes 

we have not listed and do not intend to apply to list the notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system moreover the initial purchasers of the notes may cease making a market in the notes at any time without notice in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally as a result we cannot assure note holders that there will be an active trading market for the notes if an active trading market is not maintained the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected in that case note holders might not be able to sell the notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

any adverse rating of the notes may cause their trading price to fall 

we have not obtained and do not intend to seek a rating on the notes however if a rating service were to rate the notes and if such rating service were to lower its rating on the notes below the rating initially assigned to the notes or otherwise announces its intention to put the notes on credit watch the trading price of the notes could decline 

note holders may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the notes even though note holders do not receive a corresponding cash distribution 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including the payment of cash dividends if the conversion rate is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to our common stockholders such as a cash dividend note holders may be deemed to have received a dividend subject to us federal income tax without the receipt of any cash in addition a failure to adjust or to adjust adequately the conversion rate after an event that increases a note holder’s proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to such note holder if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under some circumstances we will increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with the makewhole fundamental change such increase may also be treated as a distribution subject to us federal income tax as a dividend if a holder is a nonus holder any deemed dividend generally would be subject to us federal withholding tax at a 30 rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty which may be set off against subsequent payments on the notes 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the notes 

in the future we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options the vesting of restricted stock settlement of restricted stock units and issuance of performance shares pursuant to our employee benefit plans for purchase by employees under our employee stock purchase plan upon conversion of the notes and in relation to the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of the notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions the “option counterparties” we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock warrants the note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile could adversely impact the trading price of the notes and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2012 at a price of 1800 per share our stock price has ranged from 2262  to 7180  through december 31 2014 in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

  

 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us a decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of our notes the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock this trading activity could in turn affect the trading price of the notes some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

  

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

  

our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

  

as of december 31 2014 our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 11  of our outstanding voting stock together these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position for example these stockholders may be able to influence elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or the approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

  

provisions in our charter documents delaware law and our notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the notes

overview 

  

servicenow is a leading provider of cloudbased solutions that define structure manage and automate services across the global enterprise by applying a serviceoriented lens to the activities tasks and processes that comprise daytoday work life we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before we offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users we generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

  

a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 2826  as of december 31 2014  from 1830  as of december 31 2013  

  

  

key factors affecting our performance 

  

upsell rate  to grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers which we refer to as our upsell rate we calculate our upsell rate as the annualized contract value or acv of upsells net of losses during the period divided by our total acv signed during the period the upsell rate was 36  31  and 30 for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services 

renewal rate  we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from lost customers divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers a lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring in the period and that in our judgment will not renew typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customers acv we may deem the renewal as a lost customer our renewal rate was 97  96  and 97  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

total customers  we believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration growth and future revenues we have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force and additional partnerships with our indirect sales channel we generally define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date in situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions universities or governmental organizations each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our services are counted as a separate customer as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  our total customer count was 2725  2061  and 1512  respectively our customer count excludes customers of our express product offering which is our recently launched standardized it service management solution 

number of customers with acv greater than 1 million we count the total number of customers with acv greater than 1 million as of the end of the period we had 129  67  and 37  customers with acv greater than 1 million as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

g2k customer count   the global 2000 g2k customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics sales profit assets and market value the forbes list is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions spinoffs and other market activity to ensure the g2k customer count is accurately captured for example when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company a new g2k customer will be added in the quarter the acquisition occurs when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company or any of its related subsidiaries or any combination of entities within a g2k company only one g2k customer will be counted further penetration into entities within the g2k customer is not counted as a new customer in the g2k customer count our g2k customer count was 522  400  and 265  as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively

comparison of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013   

  

revenues 

  



  

subscription revenues increased 2174 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year driven by our upsells renewals and an increase in our customer count the number of deals with new acv greater than 1 million entered into during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were 36  and 14  respectively we define new acv as acv from new customers and upsells to existing customers the average new customer contract term were 34  months and 33  months for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the average upsell contract term and average renewal contract term remained at 24  months and 26  months respectively for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we calculate the average contract term for new customers upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv revenues from our direct sales organization and channel partners represented 87  and 13  respectively for the year ended december 31 2014  and 88  and 12  respectively for the year ended december 31 2013  

professional services and other revenues increased 405 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to 82 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to 50 million  in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year 

our annual total revenues per customer increased to approximately 287000  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to approximately 238000  for the year ended   december 31 2013  our annual total revenues per customer is the sum of average quarterly revenues for the trailing four quarters we calculate average quarterly revenues per customer by dividing the quarter’s revenues by the average number of customers in the quarter in the second quarter of 2014 we made a change to our calculation to improve the accuracy of our average revenues per customer in this filing we have used this updated calculation for each of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  the change in methodology increased the annual total revenues per customer that we had disclosed in the prior year by 3  

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 

  



  

cost of subscription revenues increased 548 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 229 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 66 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 63 million  in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of 44 million  in other overhead expenses data center capacity costs increased 54 million  primarily due to the expansion of our data centers amortization of intangible assets increased 54 million  as a result of the acquisition of neebula systems ltd or neebula in july 2014 

our subscription gross profit percentage was 75  for each of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2015 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure to the extent future acquisitions are consummated our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional noncash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired 

we expect to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31 2015 due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses 

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 388 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 216 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 84 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 32 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 60 million  in contracted thirdparty vendor costs 

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 8  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to 10  in the prior year due to increased stockbased compensation the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense knowledge contributed 82 million  or 7  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31   2014  knowledge contributed 50 million  in revenue or 6  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended   december 31 2013  we expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to remain relatively flat for the year ended   december 31   2015  

  

sales and marketing 

  



  

sales and marketing expenses increased 1459 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of 675 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 324 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 86 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 216 million  in commission expense commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 10  of subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  

in addition expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased 70 million from 83 million for the year ended   december 31 2013  to 153 million for the year ended   december 31 2014  due to an increase in attendance of more than 50 yearoveryear all other marketing program expenses which include events advertising and market data increased 61 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year 

we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2015  in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 

research and development 

  



  

research and development expenses increased 696 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of 349 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 263 million  in stockbased compensation and an increase of 67 million  in overhead expenses 

  

we expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2015  in absolute dollar terms but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

general and administrative expenses increased 345 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of 103 million  in personnel related costs excluding stockbased compensation an increase of 151 million  in stockbased compensation and an increase of 30 million  in overhead expenses outside services increased 45 million  primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with our litigation an increase in the number of contractors to support our administrative functions and costs associated with the acquisition of neebula 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended   december 31   2015  in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people and incur costs associated with our litigation but to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

stockbased compensation 

  



stockbased compensation increased 887 million during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount an increase in the weightedaverage grant date fair value of stock awards and performance rsus granted to our executives in the current year the new equity incentive awards granted in the current year including the performance rsus resulted in an increase of 751 million in stockbased compensation the weightedaverage grant date exercise price per stock option share was 6140  and 3807  for the year ended   december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the weightedaverage grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was 6113  and 3815  for the year ended   december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

in addition stockbased compensation increased 199 million related to equity incentive awards granted in the prior year for which a partial year of expense was recognized in the prior year and 24 million related to increased participation in our employee stock purchase plan the increase in stockbased compensation was partially offset by stock awards forfeited in the current year and stock awards fully vesting in the current year 

stockbased compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price and the uncertainty around the achievement of performance criteria associated with our performance rsus we expect stockbased compensation to continue to increase for the year ended   december 31   2015  in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenues 

we expect to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31 2015 due to increased costs such as noncash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses 

interest and other income expense net 

  



interest and other expense net increased 188 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 256 million  increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes the notes issued in november 2013 partially offset by a gain from foreign currency transactions and increased interest income we had a foreign currency transaction gain of 25 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to a loss of 25 million  for the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations interest income increased 19 million  due to the higher investment balances during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the prior year during the year ended december 31 2015  we expect to incur approximately 311 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements 

while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in the future 

  

  provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 2  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 4  for the prior year our tax expense increased 13 million  during the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states

our effective tax rate remained at 4 during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 our tax expense increased 11 million during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the prior year due to a higher proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with high statutory tax rates a higher loss from us operations the tax effect of acquired companies and the issuance of the notes see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

quarterly results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

  

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers we have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended september 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended june 30 our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30 and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2014  we had 6688 million in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 784 million  represented cash located overseas in addition we had  2668 million  in longterm investments which provide additional capital resources 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million and concurrently entered into a hedge or note hedge and warrant transaction or warrants the net proceeds of this debt issuance are being used for general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions the warrants are exercisable at a strike price of 10746 per share upon conversion of the notes we may choose to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock as of december 31 2014  the notes were not convertible 

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results cash utilized for acquisitions if any are consummated and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing 

  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization amortization of issuance cost and debt discount stockbased compensation tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1389 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 817 million  for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31 2014  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 54  for the year ended december 31 2014  

net cash provided by operating activities was 817 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 488 million  for the prior year the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in noncash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 70  for the year ended december 31 2013  

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended   december 31 2014  was 3169 million  compared to 4028 million  for the prior year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of 1713 million the decrease was offset by an increase of 865 million in acquisition activity due to the neebula acquisition in 2014 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 was 4028 million compared to 2391 million for the prior year the increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to increases in the net purchases of investments of 1368 million and capital expenditures of 133 million related to the purchase of cloudbased infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth additionally in 2013 we paid 133 million for the acquisition of mirror42 holding bv 

  financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended   december 31 2014  was 708 million  compared to 5686 million  for the prior year the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of 5117 million from issuance of the notes and warrants and purchase of the note hedge in 2013 the decrease was offset by 132 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan or espp and related tax benefit 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 was 5686 million compared to 2418 million for the prior year the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of 5117 million from issuance of the notes and warrants and purchase of the note hedge and 388 million increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and 132 million proceeds from our espp for the year ended december 31 2012 we received 1698 million net proceeds from our ipo 506 million net proceeds from our followon offering and 178 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 

the following table represents our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  aggregated by type 

  



  

 

in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 29 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2014  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of 02 million  and interest of 02 million  related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

  

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 

  

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues from two sources i subscriptions and ii professional services and other subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term 

our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services 

professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge our annual user conference 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

  

• there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

• the service has been provided to the customer 

• the collection of related fees is reasonably assured and 

• the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 

we use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer in subsequent transactions with an existing customer including an upsell or a renewal we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers once our services are available to customers we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue we price professional services primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model such services are delivered over a short period of time in instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met 

  

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements do not include general rights of return 

  

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us in addition the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development modification or customization we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term in determining whether professional services have standalone value we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services have standalone value 

  

we determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy under the selling price hierarchy the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price or besp the selling price for each unit of accounting is based on the besp since vsoe and tpe are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other the besp for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and current pricing practices in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis the total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price the besp for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables 

  

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software we have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services consequently we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started to be delivered once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred commissions 

  

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable terms of the related customer contracts we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we perform a twostep impairment test the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment under the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill we have determined that we have only one reporting unit we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months  to seven years  each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization we periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate if we consider any of these assets to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 

screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred including market conditions operating fundamentals competition and general economic conditions requires significant judgment additionally changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly therefore there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets impairment tests 

  stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units or rsus on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years for rsus granted with a performance condition the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria this has the impact of greater stockbased compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stockbased compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were in substance multiple awards we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the espp on a straightline basis over the offering period we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity which is based on historical forfeiture rates we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed this may cause a fluctuation in our stockbased compensation in the period of change 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law or guidance correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an update to asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers or asc 606 that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance under this update an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services as such an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance this update should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings this guidance will become effective for us for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 



  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling we are a net receiver of euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these currencies revenues denominated in us dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 72 77 and 80 during the years ended december 31   2014  2013  and 2012 respectively changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our revenues as denominated in us dollars 

  

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded we are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 25 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  and net foreign currency losses of 25 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31   2013  and 2012 respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

we estimate that a decline in the value of the us dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended december 31 2014 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the us dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately 35 million increase in operating loss for the year ended december 31 2014 this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

in february 2012 we began investing in corporate debt securities the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments as of december 31 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 56 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities and a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate 50 million increase of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet because this instrument does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates

transforming it 

all too often legacy it service management products are inflexible and it demands from lines of business and shared services in the enterprise are unmet the result has been the proliferation of applications outside the control of the it organization it organizations have often lacked visibility into the full range of applications being used across the enterprise and have been confronted with the challenge of managing disparate systems and the underlying infrastructure further this fragmentation has resulted in an inability to audit govern and meet compliance obligations work that should flow smoothly from one process to the next with easytouse technology and full transparency is forced to migrate through different opaque and complex data models interfaces and technologies often with human involvement

scalability  our services are designed to support concurrent user sessions within a global enterprise across our customer base we process billions of recordproducing transactions per month and manage multiple petabytes of data while enabling bestinclass transaction processing time 

  

availability  our customers are highly dependent on our services for the daytoday operations of their it infrastructure our services are designed as an “always on” solution 

  

security and compliance  we employ a number of technologies policies and procedures designed to protect customer data we offer services that have received ssae 16 soc1 type 1 and type 2 soc 2 and iso 27001 thirdparty attestation our us federal services have received a fisma moderate authorization ato attestation that can be used by our us federal customer base additionally our data centers have an iso27001 or ssae16 attestation or equivalent 

we have a standardized javabased development environment with the majority of our software written in industry standard software programming languages we also use web 20 technologies like ajax and html that give users an intuitive and familiar experience our hardware primarily consists of industry standard servers and network components our standard operating system and database are linux and mysql respectively and the system is highly portable across multiple platforms including microsoft windows microsoft sql server and oracle databases 

unlike many saas vendors we operate a multiinstance architecture that provides all customers with dedicated applications and databases most customers run on shared infrastructure servers while larger customers may run on dedicated servers this architecture reduces risk associated with infrastructure outages improves system scalability and security and allows for flexibility in deployment location we are also investing in enhancements to our cloud architecture which are designed to provide all our customers with increased data reliability and availability 

  

for an increased subscription fee we offer our customers the option to be deployed on dedicated hardware in our data centers in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers own servers without significant penalty our multiinstance architecture gives us the added flexibility to deploy our applications onpremises at a customer data center in order to support regulatory or security requirements when our software is installed at the customer site we define the hardware requirements that the customers must install and manage we then work with the customers to remotely install the applications and provide ongoing customer support in a similar way to how we support customer instances deployed in our own managed data centers a small percentage of our customers run an onpremises solution 

sales and marketing 

  

we sell our services through direct field sales and indirect channel sales our primary sales channel is direct sales and we also partner with systems integrators managed services providers and resale partners particularly in less developed markets in the past year we have made significant investments in direct sales in many markets outside of the united states and we intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force globally 

  

our marketing efforts and lead generation activities consist primarily of customer referrals internet advertising trade shows industry events and press releases we also host our annual knowledge global user conference and webinars where customers and partners both participate in and present a variety of programs designed to help accelerate marketing success with our services and platform 

we are investing in new geographies including investment in direct and indirect sales channels professional services capabilities customer support resources and implementation partners in addition to adding new geographies we also plan to increase our investment in our existing locations in order to achieve scale efficiencies in our sales and marketing efforts 

customers 

  

we primarily market our services to large enterprises we have proven scalability supporting large enterprisewide deployments as of december 31 2013  we had 2061  customers that operate in a wide variety of industries including financial services consumer products it services health care and technology no  single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for any of the periods presented 

backlog 

backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had backlog of approximately 608 million  and 379 million  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment for information regarding our revenue revenue by geographic area and longlived assets by geographic area please refer to note 2 and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segment please refer to the section entitled “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii and to our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding risks associated with our international operations please refer to the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10k 

data center operations 

  

we currently run our services from data centers located in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands switzerland and australia we are also in the process of establishing a data center in brazil our data centers operate in a mirrored 

configuration to provide high availability we plan to add data centers or expand our existing data center operations as required to meet regulatory requirements and accommodate growth 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development organization is responsible for the design development testing and certification of our services we focus on developing new services and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality reliability performance and flexibility of existing solutions we focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand and then bringing new services and new versions of existing services to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing applications expand the number of applications on our platform and develop additional automation technologies 

competition 

  

the markets in which we compete to automate and manage it service relationships are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for automating and managing it service relationships matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging saas and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services moreover as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we face and will face additional competition from platform vendors including salesforcecom and from application development vendors focused on these other markets 

the principal competitive factors in our industry include total cost of ownership product functionality breadth of offerings flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale 

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements and licenses to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition we have recently begun to seek patent protection for our technology we pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our service offerings policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

companies in our industry own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights we currently face and we expect we will face in the future allegations that we have infringed the trademarks copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties including our competitors and nonpracticing entities as we face increasing competition and as our business grows we will likely face more claims of infringement for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of hewlettpackards patents for additional information see item 1arisk factors in this annual report 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2013  we had 1830  fulltime employees worldwide including 636  in operations professional services training and customer support 615  in sales and marketing 352  in research and development and 227  in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

we expect our revenue growth rate to decline as our costs increase we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to generate or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations 

  

from fiscal 2009 to the year ended december 31 2013  our revenues grew from 193 million to 4247 million  we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our growth these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may result in increased costs as a result we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations if we fail to grow our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses our operating results will be harmed 

our quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued guidance our stock price could decline substantially 

  

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock or we fail to meet or exceed any forward guidance we have issued or if any forward guidance we give is below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock the price of our common stock could decline substantially some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

  

 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods if we are not able to manage this growth and expansion or if our business does not grow as we expect our operating results may suffer 

  

we continue to experience rapid growth in our customer base and have significantly expanded our operations during the last several years our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management operations infrastructure facilities and other resources our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to expand our sales force facilities infrastructure and operations and refine our operational financial and management controls human resource policies and reporting systems and procedures if we fail to effectively manage our growth our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may lose the ability to close customer opportunities enhance our existing service develop new applications satisfy customer requirements respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan 

disruptions in our services could damage our customers’ businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results 

our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses and any disruptions in our services could damage our customers businesses subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results from time to time we have found defects in our services and new defects may be detected in the future we provide regular updates to our services which frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including open source software disruptions may also result from errors we make in delivering configuring or hosting our services or designing installing expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and colocated in thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world these centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any adverse event despite precautions taken at these facilities problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and the loss of customer data in addition our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers our reputation and business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable disruptions in our services may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers the occurrence of payment delays or service credit warranty or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our warranty provisions or service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions in our services 

we face security risks including but not limited to unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data theft of proprietary information denial of service attacks loss or corruption of customer data and computer hacking attacks if any of these risks occur our services may be perceived as not secure we may lose prospective customers existing customers may curtail or stop using our services our ability to operate our business may be impaired and we may incur significant liabilities 

our operations involve the storage transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential proprietary and sensitive information including in some cases personally identifiable information protected health information proprietary intellectual property and credit card information we do not control or monitor the information that customers process in our services we are unaware of the type sensitivity and value of the customer information processed in our services and we do not vary our service offering and security measures due to the content of customer data we have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of customer data security risks including but not limited to unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data theft of proprietary information denial of service attacks loss or corruption of customer data and computer hacking attacks could expose us to substantial litigation expenses and damages indemnity and other contractual obligations government fines and penalties mitigation expenses and other liability additionally unauthorized persons may obtain access to our own sensitive proprietary or confidential information or systems including our intellectual property and other confidential business information and our information technology systems such access could be used to compromise our competitive position our ability to deliver our services or our ability to manage and operate our business the security measures protecting our customers and our own information and systems could be breached as a result of third party action employee error or misconduct because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed we could lose potential sales and existing customers our ability to operate our business may be impaired and 

we may incur significant liabilities we do not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches 

if we are not able to enhance our existing service develop new applications and promote our services for the development of custom applications our business and operating results could be harmed 

  

our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends on our ability to enhance our services and provide it in a way that is broadly accepted in particular we need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in user expectations internet software practices and communication database hardware and security technologies in addition we must effectively make our services available in additional ways including on mobile devices if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid developments our services may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete our success also depends on our ability to develop new applications and promote our services for the development of custom applications we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from subscriptions to our suite of applications for use within it and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future we are expanding the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and mediumsized businesses the success of any enhancement or new application and the success of our efforts to promote the use of our services for development of custom applications depends on several factors including timely completion adequate quality testing introduction and market acceptance any new service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner may not be priced appropriately and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues for instance we recently changed the way that we price and package our services and prospective or existing customers may not accept the new pricing in addition sales of new services may erode sales of our existing similar services if we are unable to enhance our existing service successfully develop new applications or promote the use of our services for the development of custom applications our business and operating results could be harmed 

we may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements 

  

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the expanding needs of our customers as their use of our services grows we expect the number of users and transactions we manage the amount of data we transfer process and store the number of locations from which our services are being accessed and the number of processes and systems we manage to continue to grow in the past a few of our largest customers experienced reduced levels of availability performance and functionality due to the scale at which they implemented our services in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers we intend to continue making significant investments to develop and implement new technologies in our services and cloudbased infrastructure operations these technologies which include databases applications and server optimizations network and hosting strategies and automation are often advanced complex new and untested we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies in addition it takes a significant amount of time to plan develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements we are also dependent upon open source and other thirdparty technologies and may be unable to quickly effect changes to such technologies which may prevent us from rapidly responding to evolving customer requirements to the extent that we do not effectively scale our services and operations to meet the growing needs of our customers we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate our customers may reduce or cancel use of our services we may be unable to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we may acquire or invest in companies which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments 

  

we may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies an acquisition investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in particular we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership management or otherwise 

  

negotiating these transactions can be timeconsuming difficult and expensive and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control consequently these transactions even if undertaken and announced may not close for one or more of those transactions we may 

  

 

acquisitions may also disrupt our business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities 

the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

  

the markets in which we compete to automate and manage it service relationships are fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry as the market for automating and managing it service relationships matures we expect competition to intensify we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and established and emerging saas and software vendors our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and greater resources than we do our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation further other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services moreover as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we will face additional competition from platform vendors including salesforcecom and from application development vendors focused on these other markets our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards and customer requirements an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services in addition to product and technology competition we face pricing competition some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully and competition could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

if the market for our technology delivery model develops more slowly than we expect our growth may slow or stall and our operating results would be harmed 

  

use of saas applications to automate and manage it service relationships is at an early stage we do not know whether the trend of adoption of enterprise saas solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future in particular many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy software into their businesses over time and some have been reluctant or unwilling to migrate to saas furthermore some organizations particularly large enterprises upon which we are dependent have been reluctant or unwilling to use saas because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security of their data and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions in addition if other saas providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for saas solutions as a whole including our services will be negatively impacted if the adoption of saas solutions does not continue the market for these solutions may stop developing or may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would harm our operating results 

failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our services 

  

increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our services will depend to a significant extent on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 our sales and marketing organization increased from 350  to 615  employees we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals further new hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity particularly in new sales territories 

and our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we plan or at all moreover we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas marketing campaigns and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement our business will be harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenues 

our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance 

  

we depend on various third parties such as implementation partners systems integrators managed services providers and sales partners in order to grow our business our sales efforts have focused on large enterprise customers and there are a limited number of partners with the capacity to provide these customers a significant level of services in order to continue our growth we need to recruit these partners and these partners need to devote substantial resources to our solutions accordingly we need to build services implement partner programs and provide training and other resources to recruit retain and enable these partners our agreements with partners are typically nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing solutions our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their solutions or otherwise disrupt the relationships we have with our partners in addition global economic conditions could harm the businesses of our partners and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the additional resources we expect to the relationship if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of it and offerings for small and medium sized businesses we may need to establish relationships with additional sales and implementation partners further reliance on third parties exposes us to risk of poor performance and failed customer expectations if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by a third party we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction could damage our reputation or ability to obtain additional revenues from that customer or prospective customers 

our business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions from us any decline in customer renewals or additional purchases would harm our operating results 

  

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the initial contract term expires and add additional authorized users to their subscriptions our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and our customers may not renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of authorized users although our renewal rates have been historically high some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates moreover in some cases some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the term our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers satisfaction with our subscription service professional services customer support or prices the prices of competing solutions mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base the effects of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels our growth also depends in part on our ability to sell more subscriptions and additional professional services to our current customers if our customers do not renew their subscriptions renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more authorized users or fail to purchase additional professional services our revenues may decline and our operating results would be harmed 

because our sales efforts are targeted at large enterprise customers we face longer sales cycles substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales if our sales cycle lengthens or if our sales investments do not result in sufficient sales our operating results could be harmed 

  

we target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers because these customers are often making an enterprisewide decision to deploy our services sometimes on a global basis we face long sales cycles complex customer requirements substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales our sales cycle is generally six to nine months but is variable and difficult to predict and can be much longer large enterprises often undertake a prolonged evaluation of our services including whether they need professional services performed by us or a third party for their it and business process needs and a comparison of our services to products offered by our competitors moreover our large enterprise customers often begin to deploy our services on a limited basis but nevertheless demand extensive configuration integration services and pricing concessions which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our services widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment if our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient subscription revenues to justify our investments our operating results could be harmed 

we depend on our senior management team and if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need to support our operations and growth our business could be harmed 

  

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of employees which could disrupt our business our employees are generally employed on an atwill basis which means that our employees could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could have a serious impact on our business in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in particular competition for experienced software and cloudbased infrastructure engineers in the san francisco bay area san diego seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be harmed 

we may be unable to develop or obtain intellectual property that provides us with a competitive advantage or prevents third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights we have recently begun to seek patent protection for our technology we may not be successful in obtaining patent protection and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we have and in the future may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses in defending our intellectual property rights our business and operating results may be harmed 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

  

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry our success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or services from time to time our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights 

  

for example on february 6 2014 hewlettpackard company filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of hewlettpackards patents hewlettpackard is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit this litigation is still in its early stages and the final outcome including our liability if any with respect to hewlettpackard’s claims is uncertain if an unfavorable outcome were to occur in this litigation the impact could be material to our business financial condition or results of operations depending on the specific circumstances of the outcome 

any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses modify our services or refund fees such disputes could also cause an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates and could cause us to lose potential sales even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our operating results 

our use of open source software could harm our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 

  

a significant portion of the technologies licensed or developed by us incorporate open source software and we may incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our services to adverse licensing conditions however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our services and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our services or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our services to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license moreover if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our services 

we need to continue to invest in the growth of our worldwide operations by opening new geographic markets if our required investments in these markets are greater than anticipated or if our customer growth in these markets does not meet our expectations our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

we are continuing to expand worldwide and have recently significantly expanded our presence in brazil and asia we have made and will continue to make substantial investments as we enter these and other new geographic markets these include investments in data centers and cloudbased infrastructure sales marketing and administrative personnel and facilities often we must make these investments when it is still unclear whether future sales in the new market will justify the investments in addition these investments may be more expensive than we initially anticipate if our required investments are greater than anticipated or if our customer growth does not meet our expectations our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

sales to customers outside north america expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

  

because we sell our services throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in north america sales outside of north america represented 30  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside north america are different in some ways from those associated with sales in north america and we have a limited history addressing those risks and meeting those challenges furthermore the business conduct and ethical standards of many other countries including the emerging market countries that we are expanding into are substantially different and much less rigorous than the united states the risks and challenges inherent with international sales include 

  

 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our services selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them we could be subject to increased liability from our customers or regulators even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our services to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

because we recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions which on average are approximately 33  months in duration for initial contract terms although terms can range from 12 to 120 months as a result most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small and perhaps no apparent impact on our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenues in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

we face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  

we conduct significant transactions including intercompany transactions in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of currencies relative to the us dollar can affect our revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies however in the future we may use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place moreover the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is a risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods 

  

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future results 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of earnings and losses in differing jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

  

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of saasbased companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

  

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act annually our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal material weaknesses if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities and we could incur substantial expenses 

changes in laws regulations and standards related to the internet may cause our business to suffer 

  

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy and the use of the internet as a commercial medium industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area for instance we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and changing laws regulations and standards applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in connection with providing our services in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet commerce conducted via the internet or validation that particular processes follow the latest standards these changes could limit the viability of internetbased services such as ours if we are not able to adjust to changing laws regulations and standards related to the internet our business may be harmed 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

  

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters flooding fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services and would cause us to incur substantial expense our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain in connection with any natural disaster the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event 

weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

  

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

  

risks related to our 0 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes 

although the notes are referred to as convertible senior notes they are effectively subordinated to any of our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries 

the notes will rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up our assets that secure debt ranking senior in right of payment to the notes will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all claims senior to the notes have been repaid in full there may not 

be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the notes then outstanding the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt nor does it prohibit any of our current or future subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities 

as of december 31 2013 we and our subsidiaries had 4148 million  in consolidated indebtedness and our subsidiaries had 926 million  of liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with gaap to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated 

recent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the notes 

we expect that many investors in and potential purchasers of the notes will employ or seek to employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the notes investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the notes investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock 

the sec and other regulatory and selfregulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities including our common stock such rules and actions include rule 201 of sec regulation sho the adoption by the financial industry regulatory authority inc and the national securities exchanges of a “limit uplimit down” program the imposition of marketwide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in or potential purchasers of the notes to effect short sales of our common stock borrow our common stock or enter into swaps on our common stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the notes 

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would diminish our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt instruments some of which may be secured debt we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes 

holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted 

in addition our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness moreover the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash such as the notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

in may 2008 fasb issued fasb staff position no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement which has subsequently been codified as accounting standards codification 47020 debt with conversion and other options “asc 47020” under asc 47020 an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of asc 47020 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes as a result we are required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes we will report lower net income or larger net losses in our financial results because asc 47020 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s nonconvertible coupon interest rate which could adversely affect our future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent our conversion obligation includes shares of our common stock 

holders of notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock including without limitation voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock prior to the conversion date relating to such notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion but holders of notes will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock for example if an amendment is proposed to our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the conversion date related to a holder’s conversion of its notes if we have elected to settle the relevant conversion by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share or the last trading day of the relevant observation period if we elect to pay and deliver as the case may be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in respect of the relevant conversion such holder will not be entitled to vote on the amendment although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our common stock 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in note holders receiving less than the value of our common stock into which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 1 2018 holders of our notes may convert their notes only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the cash common stock or a combination of cash and common stock as applicable into which their notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes note holders may receive less valuable consideration than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after holders exercise their conversion right but before we settle our conversion obligation 

under the notes a converting holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our common stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation 

upon conversion of the notes we have the option to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock the amount of consideration that a note holder will receive upon conversion of such 

holder’s notes will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for each trading day in a 30 tradingday observation period this period would be i if the relevant conversion date occurs prior to july 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the second trading day immediately succeeding such conversion date and ii if the relevant conversion date occurs during the period from and including july 1 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding november 1 2018 the 30 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the 32nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the amount andor value of consideration note holders receive will be adversely affected in addition if the market price of our common stock at the end of such period is below the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock during such period the value of any shares of our common stock that note holders will receive in satisfaction of our conversion obligation will be less than the value used to determine the number of shares that holders will receive 

if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes we will be required to deliver the shares of our common stock together with cash for any fractional share on the third business day following the relevant conversion date or for conversions occurring on or after july 1 2018 on the maturity date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases during this period the value of the shares that holders receive will be adversely affected and would be less than the conversion value of the notes on the conversion date 

the notes are not protected by restrictive covenants 

the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries the indenture contains no covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us except in certain cases described in the indenture connected with fundamental changes consolidations mergers or sales of assets 

the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders of the notes for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction 

if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under certain circumstances we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of our common stock for notes converted in connection with such makewhole fundamental change the increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid or deemed to be paid per share of our common stock in such transaction the increase in the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change may not adequately compensate holders for any lost value of the notes as a result of such transaction in addition if the price of our common stock in the transaction is greater than 25000 per share or less than 5373 per share in each case subject to adjustment no additional shares will be added to the conversion rate moreover in no event will the conversion rate per 1000 principal amount of notes as a result of this adjustment exceed 186115 shares of common stock subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate 

our obligation to increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with a makewhole fundamental change could be considered a penalty in which case the enforceability thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness and equitable remedies 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment for certain events including but not limited to the issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as a thirdparty tender or exchange offer or an issuance of common stock for cash that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or our common stock an event that adversely affects the value of the notes may occur and that event may not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate 

provisions in the indenture for the notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to note holders 

if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes holders of the notes will have the right at their option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes in addition if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the notes we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such makewhole fundamental change furthermore the indenture for the notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless among other things the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the 

notes and the indenture these and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to note holders 

some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a fundamental change in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the notes 

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change note holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes however the fundamental change provisions will not afford protection to holders of notes in the event of other transactions that could adversely affect the notes for example transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations refinancings restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a fundamental change requiring us to offer to repurchase the notes in the event of any such transaction the holders would not have the right to require us to repurchase the notes even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings thereby adversely affecting the holders of notes 

in addition absent the occurrence of a fundamental change or a makewhole fundamental change changes in the composition of our board of directors will not provide holders with the right to require us to repurchase the notes or to an increase in the conversion rate upon conversion 

we have not registered the notes or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any which will limit the ability of note holders to resell them 

the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes if any have not been registered under the securities act or any state securities laws unless the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have been registered they may not be transferred or resold except in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws we do not intend to file a registration statement for the resale of the notes and the common stock if any into which the notes are convertible 

we cannot guarantee an active trading market for the notes 

we have not listed and do not intend to apply to list the notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system moreover the initial purchasers of the notes may cease making a market in the notes at any time without notice in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally as a result we cannot assure note holders that there will be an active trading market for the notes if an active trading market is not maintained the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected in that case note holders might not be able to sell the notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

any adverse rating of the notes may cause their trading price to fall 

we have not obtained and do not intend to seek a rating on the notes however if a rating service were to rate the notes and if such rating service were to lower its rating on the notes below the rating initially assigned to the notes or otherwise announces its intention to put the notes on credit watch the trading price of the notes could decline 

note holders may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the notes even though note holders do not receive a corresponding cash distribution 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including the payment of cash dividends if the conversion rate is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to our common stockholders such as a cash dividend note holders may be deemed to have received a dividend subject to us federal income tax without the receipt of any cash in addition a failure to adjust or to adjust adequately the conversion rate after an event that increases a note holder’s proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to such note holder if a makewhole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity under some circumstances we will increase the conversion rate for notes converted in connection with the makewhole fundamental change such increase may also be treated as a distribution subject to us federal income tax as a dividend if a holder is a nonus holder any deemed dividend generally would be subject to us federal withholding tax at a 30 rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty which may be set off against subsequent payments on the notes 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the notes 

in the future we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options the vesting of restricted stock settlement of restricted stock units and issuance of performance shares pursuant to our employee benefit plans for purchase by employees under our employee stock purchase plan upon conversion of the notes and in relation to the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of the notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the sale of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions the “option counterparties” we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock warrants the note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes as the case may be the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 

the option counterparties andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes which could affect note holders’ ability to convert the notes and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the notes 

the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes and as a result the value of the consideration the amount of cash andor the number of shares if any that note holders would receive upon the conversion of any notes and under certain circumstances the ability of the note holders to convert the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by an option counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile could adversely impact the trading price of the notes and could subject us to litigation 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2012 at a price of 1800 per share our stock price has ranged from 2262  to 5841  through 

december 31 2013 in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

  

 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us a decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of our notes the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock this trading activity could in turn affect the trading price of the notes some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

  

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

  

our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

  

as of december 31 2013 our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 15  of our outstanding voting stock together these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position for example these stockholders may be able to influence elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or the approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

  

provisions in our charter documents delaware law and our notes might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock 

further the fundamental change provisions of our notes may delay or prevent a change in control of our company because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the notes

we offer our services under a saas business model our subscription fees include access to the ordered subscription service and related support and include updates of the subscribed service during the subscription term we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users we generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed 

  

many customers initially subscribe to our services to solve a specific and immediate problem once that problem is solved many of our customers deploy additional applications as they become more familiar with our services and apply them to new it processes in addition many customers either repurpose our it applications or build custom applications that automate various processes for business uses outside of it such as human resources facilities and quality control management a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers we continue to invest in the development of our services infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 1830  as of december 31 2013  from 1077  as of december 31 2012  

  

fiscal year end 

  

on february 3 2012 our board of directors approved a change to our fiscal yearend from june 30 to december 31 included in this filing is the transition period for the six months ended december 31 2011 references to “fiscal 2011” and “fiscal 2010” refer to the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

key factors affecting our performance 

  

upsell rate  to grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers which we refer to as our upsell rate we calculate our upsell rate as the annual contract value of upsells signed during the period net of any decreases in annual contract value of renewals during the period divided by our total annual contract value signed during the period the upsell rate was 31  30 and 29 for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011 respectively and 28 and 25 for the six months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 27 and 25 for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services 

  

renewal rate  we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annual contract value from lost customers divided by the total annual contract value from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers a lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring in the period and that in our judgment will not renew annual contract value is equal to the first 12 months of expected subscription revenues under a contract typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer however in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customers annual contract value we may deem the renewal as a lost customer we believe our renewal rate is an important metric to measure the longterm value of customer agreements and our ability to retain our customers our renewal rate was 96  97 and 97 for the years ended december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively 97 and 99 for the six months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 97 and 95 for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively 

total customers  we believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration growth and future revenues we have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force and additional partnerships with our indirect sales channel we generally define a customer as an entity with an active service contract as of the measurement date in situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions universities or governmental organizations each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our services are counted as a separate customer as of december 31 2013  and 2012 our total customer count was 2061  and 1512  respectively 

investment in growth  we have invested and intend to continue to invest in expanding our operations including increasing our headcount expanding our cloudbased infrastructure increasing access for our partners to utilize our tools and resources and developing technology to support our growth we have recently and may in the future also enter into acquisition transactions 

expansion beyond it  our customers can purchase access to our application suite for use outside of the it department customers may also purchase access to our services to develop custom applications using our platform although in the near term we expect our revenue growth to be primarily driven by adoption and penetration of our suite of applications for use within it we continue to enhance the development capabilities within our platform allowing custom application development to expand within our customer base we believe the extensibility and simplicity of our platform is resulting in an increased use of our application suite outside of the it department as well as an increase in customer application development

we generate sales directly through our sales team and to a lesser extent through our channel partners sales to our channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met from time to time our channel partners also provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee we pay referral fees to channel partners and other third parties typically ranging from 2  to 34  of the first year’s annual contract value these fees are included in sales and marketing expense

backlog  backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had backlog of approximately 6084 million  and 3790 million  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals

infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of 27 million  in other overhead expenses employeerelated costs primarily consist of salaries and wages benefits and travel hosting expenses decreased 18 million  primarily due to the migration of customers from our managed service data centers to our colocation data centers

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 266 million  during the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of 173 million  in employeerelated costs an increase of 32 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 21 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 37 million  in outside services costs 

our professional services and other gross profit loss percentage increased to 10  during the year ended   december 31 2013  compared to 4  in the prior year due to improved scoping and pricing on customer engagements better resource utilization and an increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference which contributed six  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31   2013  and 2012  all related expenses from our annual knowledge user conference are recorded in sales and marketing we expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to remain relatively flat for the year ended december 31 2014  primarily due to the anticipated increase in headcount in the professional services organization 

  

sales and marketing 

  



  

sales and marketing expenses increased 914 million  during the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of 452 million  in employeerelated costs an increase of 114 million  in stockbased compensation an increase of 52 million  in overhead expenses and an increase of 175 million  in commissions expense commissions increased primarily due to growth in bookings and current year changes to our commission plans that place more emphasis on achieving quarterly targets and allow for participants in the plan to increase their compensation at a higher rate for exceeding their annual targets commissions and referral fees amounted to 10  and 8  of subscription revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively marketing and event expenses increased 107 million  which included a 47 million  increase in expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference due to attendance more than doubling compared to the prior year 

we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended  december 31 2014 in terms of dollars and as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 

research and development

general and administrative

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended december 31 2014 in absolute dollar terms but to remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow 

  

interest and other income net 

  



interest and other income expense net decreased 65 million  during the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year primarily due to a loss from foreign currency transactions and 35 million  in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes the notes issued in november 2013 we had a foreign currency transaction loss of 25 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to a gain of 11 million  for the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations the decrease was partially offset by an increase of 07 million  in interest income due to the higher investment balances during the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the prior year during 2014 we expect to incur approximately 291 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements 

while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in the future

our effective tax rate remained at 4  during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  our tax expense increased 11 million during the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year due to a higher proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with high statutory tax rates a higher loss from us operations the tax effect of acquired companies and the issuance of the notes see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits given the full valuation allowance sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states

quarterly results of operations 

  

the following table set forth our quarterly consolidated statements of operations we have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

  

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarter ended december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers our operating expenses have increased sequentially every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  



  

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2013  we had 6346 million in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 334 million  represented cash located overseas in addition we had  2554 million  in longterm investments which provide additional capital resources 

in november 2013 we issued 5750 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and concurrently entered into a hedge the note hedge and warrant transaction the warrants the net proceeds of this debt issuance will be used for general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions the warrants are exercisable at a strike price of 10746 per share upon conversion of the notes we may choose to pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock as of december 31 2013  the notes were not convertible 

we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers lease obligations expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth operating results and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 

the following table represents our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  aggregated by type 

  



  

 

in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 09 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2013  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of 03 million  and interest of 01 million  related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

  

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenues from two sources i subscriptions and ii professional services and other subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term 

our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge our annual user conference 

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

  

 

we use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer in subsequent transactions with an existing customer including an upsell or a renewal we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract the date we make our services available to our customers once our services are available to customers we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue we price professional services primarily on a timeandmaterials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model such services are delivered over a short period of time in instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met 

  

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements do not include general rights of return 

  

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb ratified authoritative accounting guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after june 15 2010 as a result this guidance was applied to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since july 1 2010 for fiscal 2011 total revenues increased 64 million and deferred revenue decreased 64 million due to adoption of the new guidance 

upon adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance we began to account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us in addition the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development modification or customization we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term in determining whether professional services have standalone value we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services have standalone value 

  

we determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy under the selling price hierarchy the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price or besp the selling price for each unit of accounting is based on the besp since vsoe and tpe are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other the besp for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and current pricing practices in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis the total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price the besp for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables 

  

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software we have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services consequently we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started 

to be delivered once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

  

deferred revenue 

  

deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met we generally invoice our customers in annual installments for our subscription service accordingly the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear subscription license agreements deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12month period is recorded as current portion of deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as longterm 

deferred commissions 

  

deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our noncancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable terms of the related customer contracts we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable 

intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months  to six years  each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 

we periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate if we consider any of these assets to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 

stockbased compensation 

  

we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units or rsus on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term of four years we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the espp on a straightline basis over the offering period we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity we estimate the fair value of options using the blackscholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 

income taxes 

  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 

we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns 

when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal state and foreign tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update that provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward exists under the new standard update unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit is to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward the new guidance becomes effective for us on january 1 2014 and it should be applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date with retrospective application permitted we determined the impact of this new guidance is not material to the consolidated financial statements

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling revenues outside of north america as a percentage of revenue was 30  29   and 27 during the year ended   december 31   2013  2012  and 2011 respectively 29 and 26 during the six months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 25 and 28 in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

  

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded for the most part we are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations we recognized foreign currency net losses of 25 million  13 million 06 million and 03 million for the year ended december 31 2013  and 2011 fiscal 2011 and the six months ended december 31 2010 respectively we recognized foreign currency net gains of 11 million 16 million and 05 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the six months ended december 31 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

we estimate that a decline in the value of the us dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended december 31 2013  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the us dollar against other currencies would result in an approximate 03 million increase in operating loss for the year ended december 31 2013  this analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

in february 2012 we began investing in corporate debt securities the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate 26 million decline of the fair value of our availableforsale securities this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 

market risk 

in november 2013 we issued notes with aggregate principal amount of 5750 million we carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet because this instrument does not bear interest we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change and in the case of convertible notes when the market price of our stock fluctuates

we primarily market our service to large enterprises which we define as companies with over 750 million in revenues and a minimum of 200 it employees and public sector organizations we have proven scalability supporting large enterprisewide deployments as of december 31 2012  we had 1512  customers that operate in a wide variety of industries including financial services consumer products it services health care and technology no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for any of the periods presented 

backlog 

backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had backlog of approximately 379 million  and 210 million  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment for information regarding our revenue revenue by geographic area and longlived assets by geographic area please refer to note 2 and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segment please refer to the section entitled “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of part ii and to our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding risks associated with our international operations please refer to the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i in this annual report on form 10k

research and development 

  

our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to timely introduce new products technologies features and functionality our research and development organization is responsible for the design development testing and certification of our products and services our efforts are focused on developing new products and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality reliability performance and flexibility of existing solutions we focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand and then bringing new products and new versions of existing products to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace we have made and 

will continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing applications expand the number of applications on our platform and develop additional automation technologies 

competition 

  

the market for enterprise it management solutions is fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and smaller companies with point solutions our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation all of which can bundle competing products and services with other software offerings or offer them at a low price as part of a larger sale with the introduction of new technologies evolution of our product offerings and new market entrants we expect competition to intensify in the future 

  

the principal competitive factors in our industry include total cost of ownership product functionality breadth of offerings flexibility and performance we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors however many of our primary competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do 

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely upon a combination of copyright trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements and licenses to establish and protect our proprietary rights we have only recently begun to develop a strategy to seek patent protections for our technology we pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our service offerings policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult the laws of the countries in which we market our service may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it which would significantly harm our business 

we expect that we and others in our industry may be subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and services overlaps our competitors could decide to make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our service and underlying technology whether or not actually merited third parties may currently have or may eventually be issued patents upon which our current solution or future technology infringe any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2012  we had 1077  fulltime employees worldwide including 350  in sales and marketing 401  in operations professional services training and customer support 200  in research and development and 126  in general and administrative roles none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment employees in certain european countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level we have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service harm our financial results and subject us to substantial liability 

  

our customers use our service to manage important aspects of their businesses and any errors defects disruptions to our service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses from time to time we have found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future for example recently a few of our largest customers experienced reduced levels of availability performance and functionality due to the scale at which they had implemented our service we cannot be sure that we will not experience similar or other issues at even larger scales in the future we provide regular product updates which frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or released defects may also be introduced by our use of thirdparty software including opensource software defects can be hard to detect and may result in disruptions to our service in addition our customers may use our service in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers in some of these instances customers have delayed and may in the future delay payment to us may elect not to renew and may make service credit claims warranty claims or other claims against us such instances may also adversely impact our future sales further if we do not meet the stated service level commitments we have guaranteed to our customers or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our service we have provided and in the future may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future service the occurrence of payment delays service credit warranty or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable an increase to our warranty provisions or service level credit accruals or other increased expenses or risks of litigation we do not carry insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from defects or disruptions in our service or the potential harm to the future growth of our business due to defects or disruptions 

  

we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods if we are not able to manage this growth and expansion or if our business does not grow as we expect our operating results may suffer 

  

we continue to experience rapid growth in our customer base and have significantly expanded our operations during the last several years in particular we are aggressively investing in significant expansion of our cloud infrastructure and associated service capacity our global sales marketing and operations activities and personnel and additional office facility lease commitments and administrative employees our employee headcount has increased to 1077  as of december 31 2012  from 603  as of december 31 2011  we signed new leases for a larger corporate office in san diego in february 2012 additional office space in amsterdam in september 2012 in san jose in november 2012 and in london in december 2012 in addition we hired new senior management in 2011 and 2012 our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure facilities and other resources our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to expand our sales force facilities infrastructure and operations and refine our operational financial and management controls human resource policies and reporting systems and procedures for instance in 2012 we implemented a new financial enterprise resource planning system to help manage our future growth and are in the process of integrating that system with our customer relationship management system if we fail to efficiently expand our sales force operations cloud infrastructure or it and financial systems or if we fail to implement or maintain effective internal controls and procedures our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may lose the ability to close customer opportunities enhance our existing service develop new applications satisfy customer requirements respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan additionally as our operating expenses increase in anticipation of the growth of our business if such growth does not meet our expectations our financial results likely would be harmed 

we have a limited history of operating profits did not generate a profit in the year ended   december 31 2012  and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

  

we have not been consistently profitable on a quarterly or annual basis and experienced a net loss of 373 million  for the year ended   december 31 2012  as of december 31 2012  our accumulated deficit was 1055 million  while we have experienced significant revenue growth over recent periods this growth rate is likely to decrease and we may not return to profitability over the past year we have significantly increased our expenditures to support the development and expansion of our business which has resulted in increased losses we plan to continue to invest for future growth and as a result we do not expect to be profitable 

for the foreseeable future in addition as a public company we will continue to incur significant accounting legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company as a result of these increased expenditures we will have to generate and sustain increased revenues to achieve future profitability we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons including without limitation the other risks and uncertainties described in this filing additionally we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods if these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods our financial performance will be harmed 

we face security risks including but not limited to theft of personal data theft of proprietary information denial of service attacks and other hacking attacks if our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained our service may be perceived as not being secure customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities 

  

our operations involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ confidential information and security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation indemnity obligations and other liability for example our thirdparty data center facility in london was subjected to a distributed denial of service attack in january 2012 that prevented some of our customers hosted in that data center from using our service intermittently for a period of about three hours while we have administrative technical and physical security measures in place and try to contractually require third parties to whom we transfer data to implement and maintain appropriate security measures if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to our customers’ data including personally identifiable information regarding users our reputation will be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability additionally third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose potential sales and existing customers 

  

we need to continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud infrastructure and if our required investments are greater than anticipated or fail to yield anticipated cost savings and performance benefits our financial results will be negatively impacted 

  

we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in new equipment to support growth at our data centers provide enhanced levels of service to our customers and reduce future costs of subscription revenues in the year ended   december 31 2012  we purchased 208 million  in equipment for use in our data centers ongoing improvements to our cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits in addition we may be required to reinvest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers we may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments which could harm our financial results 

  

we may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements 

  

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our service grows as our customers gain more experience with our service the number of users and transactions managed by our service the amount of data transferred processed and stored by us the number of locations where our service is being accessed and the number of processes and systems managed by our service on behalf of these customers have in some cases and may in the future expand rapidly recently a few of our largest customers have experienced reduced levels of availability performance and functionality due to the scale at which they have implemented our service in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers we intend to continue to make significant investments to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations these technologies which include databases applications and server optimizations network and hosting strategies and automation are often advanced complex new and untested we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies in addition it takes a significant amount of time to plan develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements we are also dependent upon open source and other thirdparty technologies and may be unable to quickly effect changes to such technologies which may prevent us from rapidly responding to evolving customer requirements to the extent that we do not effectively scale our service and operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our service we may not be able to 

grow as quickly as we anticipate our customers may reduce or cancel use of our services and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

interruptions or delays in service from our thirdparty data center facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 

  

we currently serve our customers from thirdparty data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world with the largest located in virginia california london and amsterdam any damage to or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty data centers could result in interruptions in our service impairment of or interruptions in our service may reduce our revenues cause us to issue credits or pay penalties subject us to claims and litigation cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 

  

we do not control or in some cases have limited control over the operation of the data center facilities we use and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes floods fires power loss and similar events they may also be subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct and to adverse events caused by operator error we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any adverse event despite precautions taken at these facilities the occurrence of a natural disaster an act of terrorism or other act of malfeasance a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service and the loss of customer data 

  

if the market for our technology delivery model and saas develops more slowly than we expect our growth may slow or stall and our operating results would be harmed 

  

use of saas applications to manage and automate enterprise it is at an early stage we do not know whether the trend of adoption of enterprise saas solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future in particular many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy software into their businesses over time and some have been reluctant or unwilling to migrate to saas furthermore some organizations particularly large enterprises upon which we are dependent have been reluctant or unwilling to use saas because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security of their data and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions in addition if other saas providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for saas solutions as a whole including our service will be negatively impacted if the adoption of saas solutions does not continue the market for these solutions may stop developing or may develop more slowly than we expect either of which would harm our operating results 

  

the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed 

  

the market for enterprise it operations management solutions is fragmented rapidly evolving and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition much longer operating histories more established customer relationships larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do as a result our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements with the introduction of new technologies the evolution of our service and new market entrants we expect competition to intensify in the future if we fail to compete effectively our business will be harmed some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price which has resulted in pricing pressures if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels our operating results would be negatively impacted in addition pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales reduced margins losses or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance any of which could harm our business 

  

we face competition from inhouse solutions large integrated systems vendors and smaller companies with point solutions including saas offerings our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered our primary competitors include bmc software inc ca inc hewlettpackard company and international business machines corporation all of which are much larger and have substantially more financial resources than we do and have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale in addition many of our competitors offer saas solutions and may make acquisitions of businesses or assets that improve their service offerings further other established saas providers not currently operating in enterprise it operations management may expand their services to compete with our service many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger customer bases preexisting customer relationships and major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers in addition some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited 

number of enterprise it operation functions at lower prices or with greater depth than our service moreover as we expand the scope of our service we may face additional competition from platform and application development vendors additionally some potential customers particularly large enterprises may elect to develop their own internal solutions for all of these reasons we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

  

because our sales efforts are targeted at large enterprise customers we face longer sales cycles substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales if our sales cycle lengthens or if our substantial upfront sales investments do not result in sufficient sales our operating results could be harmed 

  

we target our sales efforts at large enterprises which we define as companies with over 750 million in revenues and a minimum of 200 it employees for instance we derived approximately 11  of our revenues from large enterprise customers in the financial services industry for the year ended   december 31 2012  because our large enterprise customers are often making an enterprisewide decision to deploy our service sometimes on a global basis we face long sales cycles complex customer requirements substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales our sales cycle is generally six to nine months but is variable and difficult to predict and can be much longer large enterprises often undertake a prolonged evaluation of our service including whether the customer needs professional services performed by us or a third party for its unique it and business process needs and a comparison of our service to products offered by our competitors moreover our large enterprise customers often begin to deploy our service on a limited basis but nevertheless demand extensive configuration integration services and pricing concessions which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our service widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment it is possible in the future we may experience even longer sales cycles more complex customer needs higher upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales as we continue to expand our direct sales force and thereby increase the percentage of our sales personnel with less experience in selling our service expand into new territories and expand into functional areas outside of the traditional itil processes if our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient sales to justify our investments our operating results may be harmed 

  

our business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions from us any decline in our customer renewals would harm our future operating results 

  

in order for us to maintain or improve our operating results it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the initial contract term expires and add additional authorized users to their subscriptions our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and we cannot assure you that our customers will renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of authorized users although our renewal rates have been historically high some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates moreover in some cases some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the term 

  

our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including our customers satisfaction with our subscription service professional services customer support or prices the prices of competing solutions mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base the effects of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell more subscriptions and additional professional services to our current customers if our customers do not renew their subscriptions renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more authorized users or fail to purchase additional professional services our revenues may decline and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer base 

  

if we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments our business could be harmed 

  

our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing service and to introduce new services in order to grow our business we must develop a service that reflects future updates to the itil framework and extends beyond the itil framework into other areas of enterprise it operations management we are also dependent on achieving growth in demand for our platform the success of any enhancement or new service depends on several factors including timely completion adequate quality testing introduction and market acceptance any new service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues if we are unable to successfully develop new applications or enhance our existing service to meet the evolving requirements of our customers our business and operating results will be harmed 

  

because we designed our service to be provided over the internet we need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware software communication database and security technologies and standards 

if we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner to these rapid technological developments and standards changes our service may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be harmed 

  

if we fail to integrate our service with a variety of operating systems software applications and hardware that are developed by others our service may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results would be harmed 

  

our service must integrate with a variety of network hardware and software platforms and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloudenabled hardware software networking browser security and database technologies any failure of our service to operate effectively with future infrastructure platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business if we are unable to respond to these changes in a costeffective manner our service may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be negatively impacted in addition an increasing number of individuals within the enterprise are utilizing mobile devices to access the internet and corporate resources and to conduct business if we cannot effectively make our service available on these mobile devices and offer the information services and functionality required by enterprises that widely use mobile devices we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers 

  

a portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities and heavily regulated organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

a portion of our sales are to governmental agencies additionally many of our current and prospective customers such as those in the financial services and health care industries are highly regulated and may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our service selling to these entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a sale furthermore engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces incremental compliance risks specific to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate government and highly regulated entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose compliance requirements that are complicated require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy due to the additional requirements of the us federal government we are in the process of establishing compliance with the federal information security management act and other federal standards relating to our operations security controls processes and architecture individual agencies also have unique requirements such as requirements that we use usonly personnel or a requirement to use our service in a nonhosted environment we may not be able to meet these standards or requirements even if we do meet them the additional costs associated with providing our service to government and highly regulated customers could harm our margins moreover changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our service to them and to grow or maintain our customer base 

  

failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service 

  

increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our service will depend to a significant extent on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers from december 31 2011  to december 31 2012  our sales and marketing organization increased from 242  to 350  employees we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally we believe there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel new hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity particularly in new sales territories our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we would like and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business because we do not have a long history of expansion in our sales force we cannot predict whether or to what extent our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive moreover we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas marketing campaigns and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement our business will be harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenues 

  

our current management team is new and if we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth our business may be harmed 

  

each of our executive officers either joined us recently or has taken on a new role in the organization these changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business our success depends substantially upon the continued services of this new group of executive officers particularly frank slootman our chief executive officer who joined us in may 2011 and 

frederic b luddy our founder and chief product officer who are critical to our vision strategic direction culture services and technology from time to time there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives our executive officers are generally employed on an atwill basis which means that our executive officers could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of one or more of our executive officers or the failure by our executive team to effectively work with our employees and lead our company could harm our business 

  

in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing developing and managing software and internetrelated solutions as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications in particular competition for experienced software and cloud infrastructure engineers in san diego san jose seattle london and amsterdam our primary operating locations is intense if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could be harmed 

  

our quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued guidance our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 

  

our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock or fail to meet or exceed any forward guidance we issue the price of our common stock could decline substantially some of the important factors that may cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include 

  

 

many of these factors are outside of our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely as such we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

  

we expect our revenue growth rate to decline and as our costs increase we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to generate or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations net of our investments over the long term 

  

from fiscal 2009 to the year ended   december 31 2012  our revenues grew from 193 million to 2437 million  we expect that in the future as our revenues increase to higher levels our revenue growth rate will decline however we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve and sustain profitability as we also expect our costs to increase in future periods we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on 

  

 

these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business we may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations net of investments if we fail to continue to grow our revenues and overall business our operating results and business would be harmed 

  

because we recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results 

  

we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions which on average are approximately 32  months in duration for initial contract terms although terms can range from 12 to 120 months as a result most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small and perhaps no apparent impact on our revenue results for that quarter such a decline however will negatively affect our revenues in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term in addition we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues 

  

if we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services our operating results will be harmed 

  

our professional services business which performs implementation and configuration of our subscription service and training for our customers has grown as our revenues from subscriptions have grown we believe our investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our subscription service as a result our sales efforts have been focused primarily on our subscription service rather than the profitability of our professional services business historically our pricing for professional services was predominantly on a fixedfee basis and the cost of the time and materials incurred to complete these services was greater than the amount charged to the customer these factors contributed to our negative gross profit percentages from professional services and other of 4  for the year ended   december 31 2012  51  and 43  for the six months ended   december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  and 21 and 202  for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010  the improvement in gross profit percentages was due in part to the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance commencing on july 1 2010 in addition in december 2011 we began shifting our pricing model to a timeandmaterials basis and pricing our services predominantly based on the anticipated cost of those services if we are unable to manage the growth of our professional services business and sustain our projected utilization rate for our professional services personnel our operating results including our profit margins will be harmed 

  

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 

  

there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry our success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others however we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or services from time to time our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights in the future we may receive claims that our applications and underlying technology infringe or violate the claimant’s intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us could 

require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments prevent us from offering our service or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses modify our service or refund fees which could further exhaust our resources in addition we may pay substantial settlement costs to resolve claims or litigation whether or not legitimately or successfully asserted against us which could include royalty or settlement payments in connection with any such litigation or to obtain licenses modify our service or refund fees which could further exhaust our resources even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such disputes could also disrupt our service causing an adverse impact to our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates 

  

our use of “open source” software could harm our ability to sell our service and subject us to possible litigation 

  

a significant portion of the technologies licensed or developed by us incorporate socalled “open source” software and we may incorporate open source software into other services in the future we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our service to conditions we do not intend however there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open source licenses and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our service and technologies for example depending on which open source license governs open source software included within our service or technologies we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our service to users at no cost make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon incorporating or using the open source software and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license 

  

if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations we could be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our service in addition if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software which could substantially help our competitors develop solutions that are similar to or better than our service 

  

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our differentiation or hurt our brand 

  

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed in addition defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation we have only recently begun to develop a strategy to seek and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology in addition any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

  

we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

  

our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance 

  

we anticipate that we will continue to depend on various third parties such as sales partners implementation partners systems integrators and managed services providers in order to grow our business identifying and qualifying these and other partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them require significant time and resources our agreements with partners are typically nonexclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing solutions our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties including our partners to favor their solutions or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our service either by disrupting our relationship with existing customers or by limiting our ability to win new customers in addition global economic conditions could harm the businesses of our partners and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the additional resources we expect to the relationship if we are unsuccessful in 

establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer even if we are successful we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in greater customer usage of our service or increased revenues 

  

if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our professional services could damage our reputation or ability to obtain additional revenues from that customer or prospective customers 

  

sales to customers outside north america expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

  

because we sell our service throughout the world we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in north america sales outside of north america represented 29  of our total revenues for the year ended   december 31 2012  and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts our business and future prospects depend on increasing our international sales as a percentage of our total revenues and the failure to grow internationally will harm our business the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside north america are different in some ways from those associated with sales in north america and we have a limited history addressing those risks and meeting those challenges the risks and challenges inherent with international sales include 

  

 

any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

we face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

  

we conduct significant transactions including intercompany transactions in currencies other than the united states dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities in addition our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities accordingly changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar can affect our revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies however in the future we may use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place moreover the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements so there is a material risk that unanticipated currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods 

  

weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

  

our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions which may remain challenging for the foreseeable future global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the it industry may harm us the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our service delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates all of which could harm our operating results 

  

changes in laws regulations and standards related to the internet may cause our business to suffer 

  

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy and the use of the internet as a commercial medium industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area for instance we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and changing laws regulations and standards applying to the solicitation collection processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data potentially restricting our ability to store process and share data with our customers in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet commerce conducted via the internet or validation that particular processes follow the latest standards these changes could limit the viability of internetbased services such as ours if we are not able to adjust to changing laws regulations and standards related to the internet our business may be harmed 

  

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future results 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of earnings and losses in differing jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates certain nondeductible expenses as a result of acquisitions the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal state or international tax laws and accounting principles increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses 

  

in addition we may be subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of saasbased companies although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period and potentially result in increased effective tax rates over the long term 

natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business 

  

natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a negative effect on us our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages pandemics and other events beyond our control although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our service to our customers and could decrease demand for our service the majority of our research and development activities corporate offices information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in california customer data could be lost significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event 

  

we are an “emerging growth company” and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

  

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act enacted in april 2012 and for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 700 million as of june 30 of any year starting with june 30 2013 we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following december 31 we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any 

choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile we expect that we will cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of december 31 2013 

  

under section 107b of the jumpstart our business startups act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 

  

we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management has to devote substantial time to public company communications and compliance obligations 

  

as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company the sarbanesoxley act and other legislation and rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission or sec and the new york stock exchange impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements these burdens may increase as new legislation is passed and implemented including any new requirements that the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 may impose on public companies moreover these rules and regulations along with compliance with accounting principles and regulatory interpretations of such principles have increased and will continue to increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly for example we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage 

these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers 

  

if we do not remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

  

prior to our initial public offering in june 2012 we were a private company and historically had limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources with which to adequately execute our accounting processes and effectively address our internal control over financial reporting this lack of adequate accounting resources contributed to audit adjustments to our financial statements in the past 

  

in connection with our preparation of the financial statements for the year ended june 30 2011 and the six months ended december 31 2011 our independent registered public accounting firm identified control deficiencies in our internal control that constituted material weaknesses a material weakness is defined under the standards issued by the public company accounting oversight board as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis the material weaknesses our independent registered public accounting firm identified related to the design and operation of policies and procedures for accounting and reporting control processes performance of account review and analysis the development and review of complex judgments and estimates the preparation of the provision for income taxes and the identification communication and accounting of significant contracts and agreements these material weaknesses which contributed to multiple audit adjustments primarily resulted from our failure to maintain a sufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge experience and training in the application of us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 

  

during the six months ended december 31 2011 we hired a new chief financial officer a new vice president of finance and several new finance and accounting managers which significantly increases our finance and accounting team’s experience in gaap and financial reporting for publicly traded companies in september 2011 we engaged a thirdparty tax firm and in february 2012 we hired a senior manager of internal audit in march 2012 we hired a vice president of tax to assist with the accounting for income taxes and review of complex tax accounting matters in january 2013 we appointed a vicepresident internal audit and increased the staff of internal audit in addition we expect to retain consultants to advise us on making further improvements to our internal controls related to these accounting areas we believe that these additional resources enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our internal review of underlying information related to financial reporting and to further enhance our financial review procedures including both the accounting processes for income taxes and significant contracts and agreements 

  

we have taken steps to address the material weaknesses as disclosed in the preceding paragraphs and as a result we believe that these material weaknesses have been remediated however we have not completed the necessary documentation and testing 

procedures under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and cannot assure you that we will be able to implement and maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting in the future any failure to maintain such controls could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations 

  

the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in particular beginning with the year ending on december 31 2013 we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section 404a of the sarbanesoxley act our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm that must be performed may reveal other material weaknesses or that the material weaknesses described above have not been fully remediated if we do not remediate the material weaknesses described above or if other material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities the remediation of this situation could require additional financial and management resources further divert managements time and attention from the core business hurt our reputation with investors and the market price of our stock could decline 

  

we may acquire or invest in companies which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments 

  

we may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies services products and other assets in the future we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide services in international locations which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in other companies an acquisition investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in particular we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired companies particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us their software is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership management or otherwise acquisitions may also disrupt our business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities 

  

negotiating these transactions can be timeconsuming difficult and expensive and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control consequently these transactions even if undertaken and announced may not close for one or more of those transactions we may 

  

 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation 

  

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2012 at a price of 1800 per share our stock price has ranged from 2262 to 4177 through 

february 28 2013 in addition the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock include 

  

 

in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within or outside our industry even if these events do not directly affect us some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we are the subject of such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock 

  

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future in addition our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our stock price 

  

our directors officers and principal stockholders beneficially own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

  

as of february 28 2013 our directors officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 42 of our outstanding voting stock including approximately 18 controlled by persons affiliated with sequoia capital and approximately 14 controlled by persons affiliated with jmi equity together these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position these stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval for example these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or the approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

  

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

  

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition certain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act any sales of securities by existing stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

  

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock 

  

our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions among other things 

  

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock

overview 

  

servicenow is a leading provider of cloudbased services to automate enterprise it operations we focus on transforming enterprise it by automating and standardizing business processes and consolidating it across the global enterprise organizations deploy our service to create a single system of record for enterprise it lower operational costs and enhance efficiency additionally our customers use our extensible platform to build custom applications for automating activities unique to their business requirements 

  

we offer our service under a saas business model our subscription fee includes access to our suite of ondemand applications access to our platform to build custom applications and our technical support and management of our cloudbased infrastructure we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users we generally bill our customers annually in advance we generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and thirdparty referrals we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel 

  

many customers initially subscribe to our service to solve a specific and immediate problem once their problem is solved many of our customers deploy additional applications as they become more familiar with our service and apply it to new it processes in addition some customers adopt our platform to build applications that automate various processes for business uses outside of it such as human resources facilities and quality control management a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers our total customers grew 55  to 1512  as of december 31 2012  from 974  as of december 31   2011  

  

we were founded in 2004 and entered into our first commercial contract in 2005 to date we have funded our business primarily with cash flows from operations we raised net proceeds of 1733 million in our june 2012 initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before deducting expenses in connection with the offering of 35 million in november 2012 we raised an additional 510 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before deducting expenses in connection with the offering of 12 million we continue to invest in the development of our service infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive longterm growth we increased our overall employee headcount to 1077  as of december 31 2012  from 603  as of december 31 2011  

  

fiscal year end 

  

on february 3 2012 our board of directors approved a change to our fiscal yearend from june 30 to december 31 included in this filing is the transition period for the six months ended december 31 2011 references to “fiscal 2011” and “fiscal 2010” still refer to the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

key factors affecting our performance 

  

total customers  we believe total customers is a key indicator of our market penetration growth and future revenues we have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force as well as the pursuit of additional partnerships within our indirect sales channel we generally define a customer as an entity with an active service contract as of the measurement date in situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions universities or governmental organizations each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our service is counted as a separate customer our total customers were 1512  and 974  as of december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively 

  

investment in growth  we have aggressively invested and intend to continue to invest in expanding our operations increasing our headcount and developing technology to support our growth we expect our total operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future particularly as we continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations further invest in research and development and grow our cloudbased infrastructure to support our growth we continue to invest in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenues and support the growth of our customer base any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization and our capacity to deliver our services will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas 

  

renewal rate  we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100 our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annual contract value from customers that are due for renewal in the period and did not renew divided by the total annual contract value from all customers due for renewal during the period annual contract value is equal to the first twelve months of expected subscription revenues under a contract we believe our renewal rate is an important metric to measure the longterm value of customer agreements and our ability to retain our customers our renewal rate was 97  for each of the years ended   december 31 2012  and 2011  97 and 99 for the six months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 97 and 95 for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

upsells  in order for us to continue to grow our business it is important to generate additional revenue from existing customers we believe there is significant opportunity to increase the number of subscriptions sold to current customers as customers become more familiar with our platform adopt our applications to address additional business use cases and expand the use of the platform throughout their enterprise our increase in subscriptions is driven by the increased number of users accessing our suite of ondemand applications as well as our other enabling technologies discovery and orchestration that are separately priced on a per server basis we believe our ability to upsell is a key factor affecting our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base we monitor upsells by measuring the annual contract value of upsells signed in the period as a percentage of our total annual contract value of all contracts signed in the period upsells as a percentage of total annual contract value signed was 30  and 29  for the year ended   december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 28  and 25  for the six months ended   december 31 2011  and 2010  and 27  and 25  for fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively 

  

investment in infrastructure  we have made and will continue to make investments in new equipment to support growth and enhancements at our data centers and expand our office facilities around the world during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed our transition from a managed service hosting model to a colocation model and invested in enhancements to our cloud architecture in our colocation data centers we recorded additional expense during the year ended december 31 2012 related to the transition from our managed service data centers to our colocation infrastructure investments during 2013 we will continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud architecture which are designed to provide our customers with enhanced scalability data reliability and availability including the purchase of additional networking infrastructure we are also evaluating the expansion of our data center locations to address additional geographic markets which will result in additional investments to our infrastructure if pursued in addition we will continue to enter into new office facility leases in the future to accommodate our projected headcount growth at various locations around the world these new leases may require investments in leasehold improvements as well as furniture and equipment to support our employees if we add to our headcount at a faster rate than anticipated we may incur substantial costs in terminating leases to enter into new leases for larger space 

  

professional services model  we believe our investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our subscription service prior to 2012 our pricing for professional services was predominantly on a fixedfee basis and the cost of the time and materials incurred to complete these services was often greater than the amount charged to the customer beginning in december 2011 we began shifting our pricing model to a timeandmaterials basis and increased our focus on scoping projects and managing resource utilization as a result of these changes our gross profit percentage from professional services improved to 4  for the year ended   december 31 2012  compared to 30  for the year ended   december 31 2011  and 51  and 43  in the six months ended   december 31 2011  and 2010  and 21  and 202  in fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively the improvement in gross profit percentages was also due in part to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance commencing on july 1 2010 

  

platform adoption  our service includes access to our suite of applications as well as access to our platform to create customerbuilt extensions to our suite of applications customers may also purchase the use of the platform to develop custom applications though in the near term we expect our revenue growth to be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our suite of applications we are investing resources to enhance the development capabilities of our platform we believe the extensibility and simplicity of our platform is resulting in an increased use of our platform by our customers to create extensions of our applications or custom applications and will enhance our ability to acquire new customers increase upsells and sustain high renewal rates 

  components of results of operations 

  

revenues 

  

subscription revenues  subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees which give customers access to our suite of ondemand applications as well as access to our platform to build custom applications pricing includes multiple instances hosting and support services data backup and disaster recovery services as well as future upgrades offered during the subscription period in addition we offer two separately priced enabling technologies discovery and orchestration we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon initiation of the initial contract or subsequent renewal our average initial contract 

term was approximately 32  months for 2012  our contracts are generally noncancelable though customers can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform 

we generate sales directly through our sales team and to a lesser extent through our channel partners sales to our channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met in addition in some cases we pay referral fees to third parties typically ranging from 10  to 20  of the first year’s annual contract value these fees are included in sales and marketing expense 

  

professional services and other revenues  professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service other revenues include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual user conference knowledge prior to 2012 our pricing for professional services was predominantly on a fixedfee basis beginning in december 2011 we began shifting our pricing model to a timeandmaterials basis going forward we anticipate the majority of our new business will be priced on a timeandmaterials basis historically most of our professional services engagements spanned six to eight months during 2012  our professional services engagements spanned approximately four  to six  months historically we billed for our fixed price professional services in two installments with the first installment due up front and the second installment due at either a specified future date usually approximately three months from the contract start date or upon completion of the services in december 2011 we changed these billing practices to bill for our fixed price professional services in installments based on milestones related to the completion of specified projects or specified dates our timeandmaterials professional services are generally billed monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred typical payment terms provide our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice 

  

prior to fiscal 2011 we recorded revenues from our professional services over a period commensurate with our subscription service contracts however the cost associated with our professional services engagements was recorded as the services were delivered resulting in lower gross profit percentages in fiscal 2010 and 2009 on july 1 2010 we adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance on a prospective basis that enabled us to separately allocate value for our multiple element arrangements between our subscription revenues and professional services revenues based on the best estimate of selling price as a result professional services revenues are recognized as the services are delivered which is substantially the same period as the associated costs are incurred this shift resulted in an increase to professional services and other revenues of 55 million for fiscal 2011 refer to “critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates” below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy 

  

backlog  backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had backlog of approximately 379 million  and 210 million  respectively we expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements varying billing cycles of subscription agreements and the timing of customer renewals

the increase in professional services and other revenues of 220 million  was primarily due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition to a shift in our pricing model to a timeandmaterials basis we had an increase in revenues of 34 million  associated with acceptances received in 2012 and an increase of 09 million  associated with our knowledge conference held in may 2012 revenues in north america represented 71  of the 220 million  total increase in professional services and other revenues revenues outside north america represented the remaining 29  

cost of revenues and gross profit percentage 

  



  

cost of subscription revenues increased 390 million  during the year ended   december 31 2012  compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in personnelrelated and overhead expenses and expenses related to our data centers personnelrelated expenses increased 186 million  consisting primarily of increased employee compensation benefits and travel expenses of 155 million  and additional stockbased compensation of 29 million  overhead expenses increased 17 million  growth in personnelrelated and overhead expenses was driven by headcount growth and investments in our cloud infrastructure and support organizations we expect personnelrelated and overhead expenses to continue to increase as we continue to hire employees in our cloud infrastructure and support organizations in order to stay ahead of our growing customer demands 

hosting expenses related to our network infrastructure increased 69 million  as we increased data center capacity to migrate customers from our managed service data centers to our colocation data centers and to support our customer growth we also opened six  new data centers since december 31 2011  in the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the transition of all our managed services data centers to our colocation data centers depreciation expense related to our equipment in our data centers increased 83 million  of which 66 million  is due to purchases of network infrastructure to support our new data centers and growth within our existing data centers and 17 million  is due to the accelerated depreciation of the assets located in our managed services data centers depreciation expense related to our managed services data centers for the year ended   december 31 2012  was 31 million  additionally outside services primarily related to enhancements to our data center security and the migration of our customers increased 20 million  for the year ended  december 31 2012 we expect data center costs to continue to increase as we continue to grow our data center footprint and purchase new equipment to support our new customers 

  

in 2013  we anticipate a substantial portion of our capital expenditures on data center capacity will be on new equipment within existing data centers to accommodate growth which generally requires less capital expenditure than provisioning the equivalent capacity in a new data center we may also add an additional data center during 2013  to service our growth in customers 

our subscription gross profit percentage decreased from 78  during the year ended   december 31 2011  to 69  for the year ended   december 31 2012  we anticipate cost of subscription revenues to increase as we increase capacity and invest in ongoing infrastructure improvements in our existing colocation data centers which will partially offset the savings related to the exit of our managed service data centers during 2012 cost of subscription revenues will also increase if we add new data centers however we anticipate cost of subscription revenues will grow at rates slower than our anticipated subscription revenue growth such that our gross profit percentage should improve during 2013 

  

cost of professional services and other revenues increased 184 million  during the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to the prior year the overall increase was primarily attributable to increased personnelrelated expenses of 155 million  consisting primarily of increased employee compensation benefits and travel expenses of 138 million  and additional stockbased compensation of 13 million  driven by headcount growth and an increase in our stock price overhead expenses increased 11 million  also due to headcount growth in addition outside services expenses increased 18 million  primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our increased sales volume 

our professional services and other gross profit loss percentage improved from 30  during the year ended   december 31 2011  to 4  during the year ended   december 31 2012  the improved gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a shift in our pricing model to a timeandmaterials basis and an increased focus on scoping projects and managing resource utilization additionally during the year ended   december 31 2012  the amount of work we subcontracted to our partners decreased as a percentage of total professional services and other revenues compared to the prior year professional services and other revenues include 20 million  and 11 million  for our knowledge conference for the years ended   december 31   2012  and 2011  respectively revenues from our knowledge conference contributed 6  percentage points and 9  percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the years ended   december 31   2012  and 2011  respectively expenses associated with the conference are included in sales and marketing expense we expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to improve as we continue to realize the benefits of the shift in our pricing model to primarily time and materials 

  

sales and marketing 

  



  

sales and marketing expenses increased 509 million  due to the expansion of our sales force and increases in marketing programs to address additional opportunities in new and existing markets total headcount in sales and marketing increased 45  from december 31 2011  to december 31 2012  contributing to a 341 million  increase in personnelrelated expenses consisting primarily of increased employee compensation benefits and travel expenses associated with our marketing team and direct sales force of 255 million  and additional stockbased compensation of 76 million  the increase is also due to increased overhead expenses of 23 million  due to increased headcount in addition we incurred an increase of 48 million  in marketing and event expenses primarily attributable to our knowledge conference which experienced a 102 increase in attendance yearoveryear commissions increased 90 million  in the year ended   december 31   2012  as compared to the year ended   december 31 2011  which was directly attributable to increased revenues and changes made to our commission plans commissions and referral fees amounted to 8  and 7  of subscription revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively these fees are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable terms of the related customer contracts 

during 2013 we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in terms of dollars but remain relatively flat as a percent of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force increase our marketing activities grow our international operations build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events in the second quarter of 2013 we expect to incur expenses of approximately 80 million to 90 million related to our knowledge conference in may 2013 compared to 36 million incurred for the event in the second quarter of 2012 due to a significant increase in the size of the event

during 2013 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in terms of dollars but decrease as a percent of revenue as we continue to grow and incur expenses related to being a public company these expenses include higher legal corporate insurance and accounting expenses and the additional expenses of achieving and maintaining compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and related regulations we also anticipate to incur exits costs related to the relocation of our san jose facility of less than 10 million and may incur other lease abandonment costs in the future if our existing leases cannot accommodate our future headcount growth 

  

interest and other income net 

  



interest and other income net primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses the increase is due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the prior year and an increase in interest income of 03 million related to our investments in marketable securities

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly trends 

  

we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our service we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the quarters ended june 30 and december 31 the increase in customer agreements for the quarters ended june 30 is primarily as 

a result of the historical terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by june 30 our prior fiscal year end the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 can be attributed to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry furthermore we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month and often the last two weeks of each quarter this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement which is generally 12 to 36 months as a result of the change in our fiscal year end from june 30 to december 31 and changes to our commission plans to provide for earlier incentives we may not see the same seasonality pattern for future quarters ended june 30 although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

  

our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as upsells to existing customers our operating expenses have increased sequentially in every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth we anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the longterm growth of our business 

  

beginning in the quarter ended september 30 2011 we accelerated investments in our headcount and infrastructure to drive our future growth as a result we generated net losses for each of the quarters in the period from the three months ended december 31 2011 through the three months ended december 31 2012 despite significant revenue growth in the period 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  



  

to date we have funded our business primarily with cash flows from operating activities and the net proceeds from our two public offerings at december 31 2012  we had 1190 million  in cash and cash equivalents of which 77 million  represented cash located overseas we also had 1957 million  in shortterm investments consisting of commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government agency securities 

  

our historical cash flows from operating activities have been significantly impacted by customer billings and payment terms as well as operating expenses related to sales and marketing research and development and expenses related to our cloud infrastructure and professional services 

  

based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth we believe our current cash cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months barring unforeseen circumstances 

  

in 2013 we expect to reinvest our cash flows from operations back into the business to support our growth our primary shortterm needs for cash which are subject to change include expenditures related to the growth of our sales and marketing and cloud infrastructure organizations including the expansion of data centers and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth we made capital expenditures of 421 million  in the year ended   december 31 2012  and anticipate increasing capital expenditures in 2013 primarily related to investments in our cloud infrastructure and facilities buildouts to accommodate our growth in 2013 we expect our cash flows from operations less capital expenditures to be relatively flat compared to 2012 

  

our shortterm needs for cash also include expenditures related to 

  

 44 

 

to the extent existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses services or technologies we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity financing or use our cash resources we have no present understandings commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions 

  

depending on certain growth opportunities we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing cloud infrastructure professional services and research and development which may require the use of proceeds from our public offerings

in fiscal 2010 we received net proceeds of 512 million from the sale and issuance of series d preferred stock which was used to repurchase and subsequently cancel shares of common stock from eligible stockholders and warrants to purchase series b preferred stock from a warrant holder 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 

the following table represents our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  aggregated by type 

  



  

 

in addition to the obligations in the table above approximately 09 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2012  it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of 02 million  and interest of 01 million  related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during all periods presented we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 

  

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met 

  

 

signed agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement if a signed contract by the customer does not exist we have historically used either a purchase order or a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement in cases where both a signed contract and either a purchase order or signed order form exist we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

  

subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract which is the date we make our service available to our customers once our service is available to customers amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue our professional services are priced either on a fixedfee basis or on a timeandmaterials basis professional services and other revenues are recognized as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model such services are delivered over a short period of time in instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized professional services revenues and the associated costs are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

  

we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history and creditworthiness of the customer if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment our arrangements do not include general rights of return 

  

we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb ratified authoritative accounting guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after june 15 2010 the guidance affects the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements with multiple deliverables and the allocation of transaction consideration to each of the identified units of accounting previously a delivered item was considered a separate unit of accounting when i it had value to the customer on a standalone basis ii there was objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and iii there was no general right of return relative to the delivered services or the performance of the undelivered services was probable and substantially controlled by the vendor the new guidance eliminates the requirement for objective and reliable evidence of fair value to exist for the undelivered items in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting the guidance also requires arrangement consideration to be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relativesellingprice method and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation under the relativesellingprice method the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price or thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable the guidance requires an entity to determine the best estimate of selling price or besp 

  

prior to the adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the items in our multiple element arrangements as a result we accounted for subscription and professional services revenues as one unit of account and recognized total contracted revenues ratably over the contracted term of the subscription agreement 

  

we adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis for fiscal 2011 as a result this guidance was applied to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since july 1 2010 the following table summarizes the effects of this new guidance on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income loss in thousands 

  



  

upon adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance we have accounted for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term and our ondemand application is fully functional without any additional development modification or customization in determining whether professional services have standalone value we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the services from other vendors the nature of the professional services the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work our professional services including implementation and configuration services are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them in some instances our customers independently contract with thirdparty vendors 

to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted thirdparty vendors as a result we concluded professional services including implementation and configuration services also have standalone value 

  

we determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the relativeselling price method based on the selling price hierarchy the selling price for each unit of account is based on the besp since vsoe and tpe are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other the besp for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors including but not limited to market competition review of standalone sales and pricing practices the total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of account based on the relative selling price the method used to determine the besp for our subscription service is consistent with the method used to determine prices for our services that are sold regularly on a standalone basis in determining the appropriate pricing structure we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products marketing analyses and other feedback from analysts we price our subscription service based on the number of users with a defined process role according to a tiered structure the besp for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables prior to december 2011 our professional services were priced on a fixedfee basis as a percentage of the subscription fee we also prepared a standard buildup cost analysis to estimate the fixed fee for our professional services based on the estimated level of effort to complete the professional services if professional services were priced below the expected range due to discounting fees allocated to professional services were limited to the amount not contingent upon the delivery of our subscription service in december 2011 we began shifting our pricing model for professional services to a timeandmaterials basis 

  

in limited circumstances we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty we have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services we defer all revenue under the arrangement until the commencement of the subscription service and any associated professional services once the subscription service and the associated professional services have commenced the entire fee from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement 

  

deferred commissions 

  

we defer expenses associated with commission payments made to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent thirdparties the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related contracts with our customers the commission payments are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts we believe this is preferable to expensing sales commissions as incurred because the commission charges are so closely related to revenues they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period the revenues are recognized additionally we believe this policy election enhances the comparability of our consolidated financial statements to those of other companies in our industry 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure compensation expense for all stockbased payments made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award as of the date of grant the expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective award we estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience at each period end we review the estimated forfeiture rate and make changes as factors affecting the forfeiture rate calculations and assumptions change we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of our stockbased awards 

determining the fair value under this model requires the use of inputs that are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop these inputs include the fair value of our common stock expected volatility expected term riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield which are estimated as follows 

  

 49 

 

if any assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously 

  

common stock valuations 

  

prior to our initial public offering the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant the valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  the assumptions we used in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment in the absence of a public trading market our board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant including the following factors 

  

   

in order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying award grants prior to our initial public offering we considered contemporaneous valuations of our stock we utilized the probability weighted expected return method or pwerm approach to allocate value to our common shares the pwerm approach employs various market approach and income approach calculations depending upon the likelihood of various liquidation scenarios for each of the various scenarios an equity value is estimated and the rights and preferences for each stockholder class are considered to allocate the equity value to common shares the common share value is then multiplied by a discount factor reflecting the calculated discount rate and the timing of the event lastly the common share value is multiplied by an estimated probability for each scenario the probability and timing of each scenario were based upon discussions between our board of directors and our management team under the pwerm the value of our common stock was based upon four possible future events for our company 

  

 

the market approach uses similar companies or transactions in the marketplace we utilized the guideline company method of the market approach for determining the fair value of our common stock under the initial public offering scenario we identified companies similar to our business and used these guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples and ratios we selected the peer group of companies based on their size business model industry business description and developmental stage while we believe that our proprietary platform to automate enterprise it operations that we provide to our customers differentiates us from other software companies we selected this peer group from publicly traded companies that are similarly viewed as being in the information technology industry and offering their services under a saas business model we then applied these market multiples and ratios to our financial forecasts to create an indication of total equity value under the strategic merger or sale scenario we utilized the guideline company method and the guideline transaction method of the market approach to determine the fair value of the common stock the guideline transaction method compares the operating results and market value of the equity or invested capital of acquired companies similar to our business the income approach which we utilized to assess fair value of the common stock under the assumption we remained a private company is an estimate of the present value of the future monetary benefits generated by an investment in that asset specifically debt free cash flows and the estimated terminal value are discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate to estimate the total invested capital value of the entity under the dissolution scenario we assumed no value remained to be allocated to our common stockholders we continually reviewed and updated the selection of companies in the peer group of publicly traded companies to better reflect the size and developmental stage of our company and to account for the acquisition of certain of the peer companies 

  

stock options and rsus granted subsequent to our initial public offering 

  

for stock options and rsus granted subsequent to our initial public offering our board of directors determined the fair value based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange on the date of grant 

income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 

  

deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence factors reviewed include the cumulative pretax book income for the past three years scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities our history of earnings and reliable forecasting projections of pretax book income over the foreseeable future and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 

  

we recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these differences as well as any interest and penalties will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 

  

ceaseuse loss upon exit of facility 

  

in august 2012 we relocated our san diego office to another facility in san diego as part of this move we incurred lease abandonment costs of 25 million  which primarily consists of a loss on disposal of assets and a ceaseuse loss recorded upon vacating our prior san diego office the lease on our prior headquarters facility expires in 2019 the ceaseuse loss was calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period adjusted for deferred items and lease incentives in calculating the ceaseuse loss management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease the key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and a creditadjusted riskfree discount rate of 508 these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates resulting in significant adjustments to the ceaseuse loss recorded or to be recorded 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income this guidance requires the disclosure of the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification we will adopt this accounting standard upon its effective date for periods beginning on or after december 15 2012 and this adoption will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 



  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro and british pound sterling revenues outside of north america as a percentage of revenue was 29  and 27  during the year ended   december 31   2012  and 2011  respectively 29 and 26 during the six months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 25 and 28 in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

  

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded for the most part we are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations we recognized foreign currency net gains of 11 million 16 million and 05 million in the year ended   december 31 2012  the six months ended december 31 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively we recognized foreign currency net losses of 13 million 06 million and 03 million in the year ended december 31 2011 fiscal 2011 and the six months ended december 31 2010 respectively while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

we estimate that a 10 decline in the value of the us dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended december 31 2012 this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

in february 2012 we began investing in corporate debt securities the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments due to the shortterm nature of our investment portfolio however we do not believe an immediate 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio we therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates
