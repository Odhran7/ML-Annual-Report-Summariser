 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the following risk factors which may have materially affected or could materially affect us including impacting our business financial condition results of operations stock price credit rating or reputation you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our financial statements and supplementary data in item 8 these are not the only risks we face we could also be affected by other unknown events factors uncertainties or risks that we do not currently consider to be material 

business and operating risks 

the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus covid19 has had a significant impact on us as well as on the operations financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers we are unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic or variations thereof will continue to impact us 

the covid19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on business and consumer activity including a curtailment of business activities including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services and resulted in weakened economic conditions significant supply chain disruptions ongoing economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets the effects of the covid19 pandemic have significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact us and have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on the operations financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers 

because the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its consequences remain uncertain are changing and difficult to predict the future impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity also remains uncertain and difficult to predict the impact of the pandemic will continue to depend on evolving factors many of which are not within our control and to which we may not be able to effectively respond these risks include but are not limited to a significant reduction in revenue due to renewed or extended curtailment of business activities a significant increase in our expenses or a reduction in our operating margins due to longterm changes in the mix of our products and services effects from governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel and transportation and workforce pressures reductions in operating effectiveness due to employees working remotely unavailability of personnel the delay or cancellation of capital projects and related delays in or loss of expected benefits therefrom limited access to liquidity increased volatility and pricing in the capital and commercial paper markets further disruption of global supply chains impairments in the fair value of our assets increases in pension funding obligations and reductions in our customers’ creditworthiness further the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from it could also precipitate or aggravate risk factors that we identify herein or affect our operations and financial performance in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material the occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in general economic conditions in the us and internationally may adversely affect us 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate changes in general economic conditions are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors for example we are affected by levels of industrial production inflation consumer spending and retail activity we could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy including without limitation the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we have also been and may in the future be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions as a result of geopolitical uncertainty andor conflicts in the countries andor regions where we operate including the united kingdom the european union the ukraine the russian federation and the transpacific region changes in general economic conditions or our inability to accurately forecast these changes or mitigate the impact of these conditions on our business could materially adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving we expect to continue to face significant competition which could materially adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving including demands for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments we expect to continue to face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis competitors include the u s and other international postal services various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers large transportation and ecommerce companies that have made and continue to make significant investments in their own logistics capabilities some of whom are currently our customers we also face competition from start ups and other smaller companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs competition may also come from other sources in the future as new technologies are developed competitors have cost operational and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services or pricing terms that we are not willing or able to offer additionally to sustain the level of service and value that we deliver to our customers from time to time we may raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices if we do not timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures including replacing any lost volume or maintaining our profitability we could be materially adversely affected 

continued transportation market growth may further increase competition as a result competitors may improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could materially adversely affect us 

changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us 

for the year ended december 31 2021 business from one customer amazoncom inc and its affiliates accounted for 117 of our consolidated revenues some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year customer impact on our revenue is based on factors such as pricing terms product launches ecommerce or other industry trends including those related to the holiday season business combinations and the overall growth of a customers underlying business as well as any disruptions to their businesses customers could choose and have in the past chosen  to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own logistics capabilities in addition certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party if all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or significantly change this could materially adversely affect us 

failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us 

we maintain a large workforce we necessarily depend on the skills and continued service of our employees including our executive leadership team we also regularly hire a large number of parttime and seasonal workers we must attract engage develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce while controlling labor costs and maintaining an environment that supports our core values our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous factors including turnover training costs regulatory changes market pressures inflation unemployment levels and healthcare and other benefit costs if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher labor costs reduced revenues further increased workers compensation and automobile liability claims regulatory noncompliance customer losses and diminution of our brand value or company culture which could materially adversely affect us 

in addition our strategic initiatives including transformation have led and are expected to continue to lead to the creation of fewer but more impactful jobs as we strive to lower our cost to serve our inability to continue to retain experienced and motivated employees may also materially adversely affect us 

increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach which could materially adversely affect us 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security various governments have adopted and may continue to adopt stricter security requirements resulting in increased operating costs in the transportation industry regulatory and legislative requirements may change periodically in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our operations cost structure or operating results and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could materially adversely affect us 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could materially adversely affect us 

many of our us employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters the teamsters our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements in addition some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements strikes work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs as a result customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may permanently lose customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could materially adversely affect us the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could materially adversely affect us 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation service quality issues actual or perceived could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers not to use ups services also adverse publicity or public sentiment surrounding labor relations environmental and sustainability concerns security matters political activities and similar matters or attempts to connect our company to such issues either in the us or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and demand for our services damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could have a material adverse effect on us and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant data breach or information technology system disruption could materially adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet and a number of internallydeveloped systems and applications for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of the physical receipt of packages to move and track packages through our operations to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data our franchise locations and subsidiaries also rely on information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities 

in addition our services and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others we regularly move data across national borders and are subject to a variety of evolving laws and regulations in the us and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the eus general data protection regulation greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of and potential penalties under eu law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries have also enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders these evolving requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

information technology systems ours as well as those of our franchisees acquired businesses and thirdparty service providers are susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to programming errors defects or other vulnerabilities power outages hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks ransomware attacks malware attacks theft misconduct by employees or other insiders telecommunications failures misuse human errors or other catastrophic events these events may from time to time cause service outages allow inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personally identifiable information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to prevent any of the events described above 

we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including our customers franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and thirdparty delivery services these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and information technology systems disruptions like those described above and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we implement and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events these events could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to misuse or disclosure of information or systems that are important to us including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems franchisees customers service providers or other thirdparties could result in material disruptions in our business the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny litigation and other potential liability in addition our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted further disrupting our operations similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation fines sanctions or other penalties 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in technology security initiatives information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent complex and sophisticated cyber threats despite our best efforts we are at risk from data breaches and system disruptions although to date we are unaware of any material data breach or system disruption including a cyberattack we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful 

global climate change presents challenges to our business which could materially adversely affect us 

the effects of climate change create financial and operational risks to our business both directly and indirectly we have made several public statements regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions including our most recent goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and our other short and midterm environmental sustainability goals we may be required to expend significant additional resources to acquire assets or on remediation efforts to meet these goals which could significantly increase our operational costs we could also be required to write down the carrying value of assets which could result in impairment charges 

further there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our goals will be achieved or that any future investments we make will meet investor expectations or any legal standards regarding sustainability performance in particular our ability to meet our goals depends in part on significant technological advancements with respect to the development and availability of reliable affordable and sustainable alternative solutions including aviation fuel and alternative fuel vehicles moreover we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business social governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic regulatory or social factors business strategy or other factors if we do not meet these goals then in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance we could incur adverse publicity and reaction which could adversely impact our reputation and in turn adversely impact our results of operations while we remain committed to being responsive to climate change and reducing our carbon footprint there can be no assurance that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful that the costs related to climate transition will not be higher than expected that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect or at all or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures operating margins and results of operations 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could materially adversely affect us 

severe weather conditions or other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires earthquakes epidemics pandemics conflicts unrest or terrorist attacks have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business customers may reduce shipments or our costs to operate our business may increase either of which could have a material adverse effect on us any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

economic political or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us 

we have significant international operations we are exposed to changing economic political and social developments that are beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in other countries and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers govern our environmental impact or labor matters and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us 

our inability to effectively integrate any acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances or dispositions could materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we acquire businesses form joint ventures and strategic alliances and dispose of operations whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions will depend in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations unanticipated performance issues or transactionrelated charges 

financial risks 

we are exposed to the effects of changing fuel and energy prices including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through fuel surcharges and utilizing hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges high fuel surcharges have in the past and may in the future result in a shift from our higheryielding products to loweryielding products or an overall reduction in volume revenue and profitability there can also be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war weatherrelated events or natural disasters actions by producers including as part of their own sustainability efforts or other factors beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 

we conduct business in a number of countries with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the statements of consolidated income the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs and affecting our debt is discussed further in part i item 7  critical accounting estimates and part ii “item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” respectively of this report 

we monitor and manage currency exchange rates and interest rate exposure and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged and may have a material adverse effect on us  

our business requires significant capital and other investments if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs we could be materially adversely affected 

our business requires significant capital investments including in aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sortation and other equipment in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions and consistent with our longterm strategy and commitments these investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us further cost increases could materially adversely affect us 

our employee health retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs in particular ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our companysponsored defined benefit plan obligations increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and have required and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans our national master agreement with the teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us 

we participate in various trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining however in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by ups employees in the central states pension fund the cspf for additional information on our potential liabilities related to the cspf see note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

insurance and claims expense could materially adversely affect us 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation selfinsured workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk continues to increase which has occurred in recent periods our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage 

changes in markets and our business plans have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets changes in business strategy government regulations including related to climate change and economic or market conditions have resulted from time to time and may in the future result in substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes have in the past and may in the future reduce our net income 

we may have significant additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

regulatory and legal risks 

increasingly complex and stringent laws regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment safety privacy and data protection and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and internationally in addition we are impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges trade discussions between the us and various of its trading partners are fluid and existing and future trade agreements are and are expected to continue to be subject to a number of uncertainties including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs the impact of new laws regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with any new laws regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or policies in the us or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could materially adversely affect us 

increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions exposes us to potentially significant new taxes fees and other costs compliance with such regulation and any increased or additional regulation or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation 

for example in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” adopted the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth a voluntary participation pilot phase began in 2021 and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

in the us congress has considered but to date not passed various bills that would regulate ghg emissions nevertheless we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency could determine to regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us 

in addition the impact that the recent reentry into the paris climate accord may have on future us policy regarding ghg emissions on corsia and on other ghg regulation remains uncertain the extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us 

increased regulation relating to ghg emissions in the us or abroad especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions could increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely we cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results it is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures which may materially adversely affect us 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are on a journey to execute our customer first people led innovation driven strategy within our better not bigger framework we are focused on improving revenue quality reducing our cost to serve growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion the customer first component of our strategy focuses on among other things enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most speed and ease of access to our services the people led component of our strategy aims to enhance the employee value proposition our innovation driven strategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience 

we have two reportable segments us domestic package and international package which are together referred to as our global small package operations our remaining businesses are reported as supply chain solutions for the year we increased average daily volume revenue per piece and operating margin within global small package operations with growth led by small and mediumsized businesses smbs as we executed on our strategy the covid19 pandemic continued to have and is expected to continue to have an impact on our business we experienced a yearoveryear increase in commercial volume as business returned to prepandemic levels while businesstoconsumer volume declined partly due to the surge in ecommerce at the onset of the pandemic in the second half of the year covid19 resulted in a reduction in the number of flights we operated in asia relative to our expectations which contributed to an overall decline in international volume in the fourth quarter within supply chain solutions operating margin increased with demand for our services particularly strong in forwarding and healthcare logistics including covid19 relief efforts 

the overall economic environment continues to be challenging global supply chain disruption continues and resulted in capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs particularly in our supply chain solutions businesses rising inflation and labor market challenges continue to cause wage pressures in certain markets we continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business however we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong 

during the first quarter of 2021 following enactment of the american rescue plan act arpa we remeasured the upsibt full time employee pension plan this resulted in a 33 billion pretax marktomarket gain in the first quarter we completed the divestiture of ups freight on april 30 2021 and used the cash proceeds of 848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness we recognized a pretax gain of 46 million for the year in respect of this transaction the divestiture triggered a remeasurement of certain of our us defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans which had only an immaterial impact on results of operations for the year for additional information on this divestiture see note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements following the divestiture we renamed our supply chain  freight businesses supply chain solutions 

in october 2021 we completed the acquisition of roadie a technology platform focused on sameday delivery services for 586 million the results of roadie are reported within supply chain solutions the acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year see note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

highlights of our results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 which are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow include 



• revenue increased in all segments with double digit revenue per piece growth in both us domestic package and international package 

• average daily package volume increases were driven by growth in smb and businesstobusiness volume 

• operating expenses increased primarily driven by fuel and thirdparty transportation costs 

• operating profit and operating margin increased in global small package and supply chain solutions 

• we reported net income of 129 billion and diluted earnings per share of 1468 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 1213 after adjusting for the aftertax impacts of 

◦ a gain on the divestiture of ups freight of 35 million or 004 per diluted share 

◦ transformation strategy costs of 285 million or 032 per diluted share and 

◦ a pension marktomarket gain recognized outside of a 10 corridor of 25 billion or 283 per share 

in the us domestic package segment volume increases were driven by strong growth from smbs revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases as well as increases in fuel and demandrelated surcharges expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs which were slightly offset by productivity improvements 

the international package segment also experienced volume growth for the year driven by businesstobusiness volume revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demandrelated surcharges base rate increases shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs driven by higher fuel prices and volume growth which resulted in additional thirdparty pickup and delivery expense 

in supply chain solutions the impact of divesting ups freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses primarily forwarding and logistics forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases within logistics we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations expense increases in supply chain solutions were primarily due to higher thirdparty transportation costs

supplemental information  items affecting comparability 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures these include adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate net income and earnings per share adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities amounts related to marktomarket gains or losses transformation and other charges goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures as described below 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in more fully understanding our financial results and assessing our ongoing performance because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses these nongaap measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations 

adjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap our adjusted financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting therefore our adjusted financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

adjusted amounts reflect the following in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax impacts from transformation and other charges marktomarket gains and losses goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the taxdeductible adjustments the blended average effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were 238 and 225 respectively

transformation and other charges goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures 

we supplement the presentation of our operating profit operating margin income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with nongaap measures that exclude the impact of charges related to transformation activities goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures for more information regarding transformation activities see note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures see note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities 

we also supplement the reporting of revenue revenue per piece and operating profit with adjusted measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities we believe currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results we evaluate the performance of international package and supply chain solutions on this currencyneutral basis 

currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit the derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities the difference between the current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations 

defined benefit plans marktomarket impacts 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of investment income expense and other within other income and expense  we supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with nongaap measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects we believe excluding these marktomarket impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with shortterm changes in market interest rates equity values and similar factors 

investment income expense and other reflects the actual return on plan assets 911 in 2021 and 1254 in 2020 and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date 311 in 2021 and 287 in 2020 adjusted investment income expense and other utilizes the expected return on plan assets 640 in 2021 and 770 in 2020 and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 287 in 2021 and 355 in 2020 

the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans assets and liabilities resulted in a 33 billion marktomarket gain in 2021 and 65 billion loss in 2020

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

the table below shows the amounts associated with each component of the pretax marktomarket gain loss as well as the weightedaverage actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost for each year 



the pretax marktomarket gains and losses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following 

2021  33 billion pretax marktomarket gain 

• discount rates 19 billion pretax gain this gain was driven by the interim remeasurement of the upsibt plan in the first quarter of 2021 the weightedaverage discount rate for our upsibt plan increased from 298 as of december 31 2020 to 370 as of march 31 2021 primarily due to an increase in us treasury yields 

• return on assets 03 billion pretax loss this loss was primarily driven by the interim remeasurement of the upsibt plan in the first quarter of 2021 as of march 2021 the actual rate of return on the plan assets was approximately 220 basis points lower than our expected rate of return primarily due to weak global equity and us bond market performance 

• demographic and other assumption changes 01 billion pretax loss this represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors including items such as healthcare cost trends compensation rate increases and rates of termination retirement and mortality 

• coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund 18 billion pretax gain this represents the reduction of the liability for potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund 

2020  65 billion pretax marktomarket loss 

• discount rates 65 billion pretax loss the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 355 as of december 31 2019 to 287 as of december 31 2020 primarily due to a decline in us treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on aarated corporate bonds 

• return on assets 24 billion pretax gain in 2020 the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return primarily due to strong global equity and us bond market performance 

• demographic and other assumption changes 04 billion pretax loss this represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors including items such as healthcare cost trends compensation rate increases and rates of termination retirement and mortality 

• coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund 20 billion pretax loss this represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund

expense allocations 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our operating segments using activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates would directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment our allocation methodologies are refined periodically as necessary to reflect changes in our businesses 

in the first quarter of 2021 we updated our cost allocation methodology for aircraft engine maintenance expense to better align with aircraft utilization by segment this change resulted in a reallocation of expense from our us domestic package segment to our international package segment of approximately 73 million for the year 

upon the divestiture of ups freight revenue and costs associated with the ground with freight pricing gfp product began to be reported in us domestic package

us domestic package 



revenue 

the change in revenue was due to the following factors 



volume 

average daily volume increased slightly driven by smb customer volume growth of 18 as a result of the continued execution of the customer first component of our strategy which was partially offset by a decline in ground residential volume from our large customers we anticipate this decline will moderate in 2022 and be offset by growth in ground residential volume from our smb customers we expect overall volume growth levels in 2022 will remain consistent with 2021 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

businesstoconsumer shipments represented approximately 607 of average daily volume compared to 636 in 2020 the decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated ecommerce spending and a reduction in businesstobusiness activity in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic businesstobusiness shipments increased 94 primarily in our ground commercial product as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

average daily volume in our next day air product increased as a result of the increase in businesstobusiness activity from smbs and large customers higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in next day air deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above prepandemic levels with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand 

surepost average daily volume decreased 107 driven by declines in volume from large customers ground commercial volume increased 70 with growth in all customer segments 

rates and product mix 

overall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in smb volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy and from demandrelated and fuel surcharges rates for ground and air services increased an average of 49 in december 2020 and our surepost rates also increased at that time we anticipate demandrelated surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022 

revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above the increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece revenue per piece for our ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above 

we are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy 

fuel surcharges 

we apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  

while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges are only one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and additional charges for these services and the pricing discounts offered 

total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 13 billion driven by a significant increase in fuel surcharge indices we expect the impact of these increases will continue in 2022

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased driven by a 17 billion increase in the cost of operating our integrated air and ground network and a 17 billion increase in pickup and delivery costs in addition the cost of package sorting increased 514 million and other indirect operating costs increased by 245 million the increase in expense was driven by 

• higher fuel costs primarily attributable to increases in the price of jet fuel diesel and gasoline which we expect to persist 

• higher employee benefit expense for our union workforce due to contractual contribution rate increases to multiemployer plans and additional headcount becoming eligible for health welfare and retirement benefits

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

• additional compensation expense due to contractual rate increases for our union workforce cost of living and wagerate adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors also drove higher compensation costs volume growth also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by productivity improvements management payroll increased primarily due to incentive compensation and commission payments 

• higher thirdparty transportation costs as a result of our investments to improve timeintransit within our ground network partially offset by lower thirdparty carrier costs for surepost and rail due to lower volumes 

• the reallocation of expense for the gfp product following the divestiture of ups freight resulted in an increase of 281 million in segment operating expenses 

total cost per piece and adjusted cost per piece excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased 74 we anticipate that overall costs and cost per piece may continue to increase during 2022 as a result of contractual cost increases and market factors including inflation and the availability and cost of labor we expect this expense growth to moderate in 2022 due to additional operational improvements 

operating profit and margin 

as a result of the factors described above operating profit increased 25 billion with operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 107 excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges adjusted operating profit increased 26 billion with adjusting operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 111

results of operations 

volume 

average daily volume increased for both domestic and export products with growth primarily in the first half of the year volume declined in the fourth quarter largely due to the yearoveryear impacts of covid19 on consumer behavior for the year we experienced growth from both smbs and large customers primarily in the retail manufacturing and technology sectors businesstobusiness volume increased 108 as commercial activity largely returned to prepandemic levels businesstoconsumer volume increased 51 with growth primarily in the first quarter when covid19 driven volume was not present in the comparative period we expect overall volume growth to accelerate in 2022 

export volume increased for the year led by europe and the americas while asia volume was largely unchanged volume growth was strongest on intraeurope trade lanes as well as from europe and the americas to the united states trade between europe and the united kingdom declined throughout the year as a result of brexit which became effective on january 1 2021 asia export volume grew significantly in the first quarter but was then impacted in the second quarter by a reduction in shipments of personal protective equipment relative to 2020 additionally covid19 impacts within the region reduced the number of flights operated in the second half of the year 

premium products saw volume growth of 149 driven by worldwide express and transborder express products volume for nonpremium products increased 69 driven by growth in our transborder standard product worldwide standard volume increased primarily as a result of brexit with shipments between the united kingdom and the european union that are now subject to duties and taxes shifting from transborder to worldwide products 

domestic volume increased for the year in many markets with the strongest growth in the united kingdom and western europe largely due to the impact of covid19 on businesstoconsumer demand during the fourth quarter domestic volume declined driven by a reduction in ecommerce resulting in fewer residential deliveries that was slightly offset by growth in commercial volume 

rates and product mix 

in december 2020 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market in response to capacity constraints resulting from the covid19 pandemic we began to apply demandrelated surcharges on certain lanes in the second quarter of 2020 these surcharges are expected to remain elevated in 2022 

total revenue per piece increased 144 driven by changes in base pricing fuel and demandrelated surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix currency movements contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year but had a negative impact in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece increased 120 for the year 

export revenue per piece increased 151 as a result of the factors described above excluding the impact of currency movements export revenue per piece increased 132 

domestic revenue per piece increased 99 due to changes in base pricing fuel surcharges and customer and product mix although currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in the fourth quarter they contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year excluding the impact of currency movements revenue per piece increased 56 

we expect revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022 

fuel surcharges 

the fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the us is largely indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel the fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the us are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates 

while fluctuations can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and extra service charges and any pricing discounts offered total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 866 million primarily due to increases in fuel surcharge indices as well as overall volume growth and changes in customer and product mix

operating expenses 

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased the costs of operating our integrated international air and ground network increased 12 billion driven by the impact of higher fuel prices and volume growth we expect these trends to continue in 2022 

in addition to variability in usage and market prices the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of costs on our results the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm 

pickup and delivery costs increased 718 million primarily due to volume growth that drove additional thirdparty transportation expense package sorting costs increased 198 million also as a result of overall volume growth we anticipate that these operating expenses may continue to increase due to volume growth and external market factors such as fuel prices and inflation 

the remaining increase in operating expenses was due to increases in other indirect operating costs 

operating profit and margin 

as a result of the factors described above operating profit increased 12 billion with operating margin increasing 230 basis points to 238 excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges adjusted operating profit also increased 12 billion with operating margin increasing 200 basis points to 242

revenue 

total revenue for supply chain solutions increased 22 billion 

forwarding revenue increased for the year in our international air freight business revenue growth was driven by higher volume as a result of strong outbound demand globally demandrelated surcharges and rate increases also contributed to revenue growth as demand continued to exceed capacity in the market we expect the elevated level of demand to persist ocean freight forwarding revenue increased driven by asiaexport volume and higher market rates throughout the year we expect surcharges for ocean freight forwarding to be lower in 2022 relative to 2021 as supply and demand within the market begins to normalize revenue in our truckload brokerage business increased due to market rate increases and the continued execution of our strategy slightly offset by a reduction in volume 

within logistics our healthcare operations experienced strong revenue growth across a broad range of customers including covid19 relief efforts revenue in our mail services business increased as a result of rate increases and a favorable shift in product characteristics partially offset by lower volumes our other distribution operations experienced yearoveryear revenue increases driven by new business growth 

as a result of the divestiture ups freight revenue decreased 21 billion for the year 

revenue from the other businesses within supply chain solutions increased driven by services provided to the acquirer of ups freight under certain transition services agreements and by growth in our logistics consulting services ups capital and additional volume from service contracts with the us postal service 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses for supply chain solutions and operating expenses excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased in 2021 

forwarding operating expenses increased 26 billion driven by an increase in purchased transportation of 25 billion this increase was primarily due to higher market rates across all of our forwarding businesses that were driven by supply constraints and demandrelated surcharges as well as volume growth in our international air freight and ocean freight forwarding businesses capacity constraints are expected to persist resulting in purchased transportation cost remaining elevated 

logistics operating expenses increased 538 million due to higher purchased transportation expense and operational expense growth in our healthcare operations as a result of covid19 relief efforts and strong demand for our healthcare logistics services carrier rate increases drove higher expense within mail services and business growth in our other distribution operations also resulted in additional purchased transportation expense 

ups freight operating expenses decreased 28 billion as a result of the divestiture 

expense for the other businesses within supply chain solutions increased primarily due to higher thirdparty transportation expense in logistics consulting and transportation and other costs incurred under transition services agreements with the acquirer of ups freight 

operating profit and margin 

as a result of the factors described above total operating profit increased 14 billion with operating margin increasing 750 basis points to 99 excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges and other gains adjusted operating profit increased 649 million with adjusted operating margin increasing 280 basis points to 98

total compensation and benefits and total compensation and benefits excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased in 2021 

total compensation costs and total compensation costs excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges increased 10 billion or 38 primarily as a result of 

• us domestic compensation increased 704 million as a result of higher direct labor costs due to contractual rate increases for our union workforce as well as wagerate and cost of living adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors volume growth drove additional headcount and an increase in average daily union hours which was partially offset by productivity improvements 

• international cost increased 380 million primarily due to volume growth as well as the impacts of operational disruption last year that resulted from covid19 restrictions 

• management compensation increased 416 million due to salary increases higher incentive compensation and sales commissions and workforce growth that was primarily from additional parttime positions 

• these increases were partially offset by the impact of divesting ups freight which decreased cost by 583 million 

benefits costs increased 13 billion excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges adjusted benefits increased 12 billion as a result of 

• health and welfare costs increased 530 million driven by increased contributions to multiemployer plans resulting from growth in the eligible workforce and contractual rate increases 

• pension and postretirement benefits increased 374 million due to an increase in the overall size of the workforce increased contributions to multiemployer plans as a result of contractuallymandated rate increases and higher service costs for companysponsored plans 

• vacation excused absence payroll taxes and other expenses increased 212 million primarily driven by salary increases increases in the overall size of the workforce and additional discretionary payments to certain employees 

• workers compensation expense increased 51 million due to an increase in total hours worked and higher claim counts partially offset by improved claims trends relative to the previous year and lower activity resulting from the divestiture of ups freight 

repairs and maintenance 

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was driven by additional aircraft engine maintenance cost primarily due to the increase in operating activity routine repairs and maintenance for buildings and facilities and maintenance costs for our other transportation equipment increased slightly 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of additional operating facilities coming into service and investments in internally developed software as well as growth in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets 

purchased transportation 

the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers was primarily driven by 

• supply chain solutions expense increased 22 billion primarily due to market rate and volume increases in our international air freight and ocean freight businesses and rate increases in our truckload brokerage business these increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of ups freight which reduced thirdparty transportation costs by 596 million 

• international package expense increased 617 million primarily due to additional volume being handled by thirdparty pickup and delivery services in asia and europe currency movements also negatively impacted expense primarily in europe 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

• us domestic package expense increased 310 million due to ongoing investments to improve timeintransit in our us ground network and overall increases in pershipment costs these impacts were partially offset by decreases in rail and surepost volumes for the year 

fuel 

higher fuel prices increased expense 12 billion increases in usage from additional aircraft block hours and miles driven were partly offset by the impact of the divestiture of ups freight 

other occupancy 

the increase in other occupancy expense and other occupancy expense excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation and other charges was due to higher utilities costs rent and property tax increases and ongoing facility maintenance 

other expenses 

other expenses and other expenses excluding the yearoveryear impact of transformation strategy costs and goodwill asset impairment charges and divestitures increased as a result of 

• other operational expenses including vehicle and equipment rentals increased 214 million primarily driven by business growth 

• the cost of business services that support our operating segments increased 129 million driven by business growth and the expansion of services provided 

• customer claims increased 108 million driven by changes to our claims policy which resulted in higher claims for lost packages 

• other increases included the cost of goods provided under transitional service agreements to the acquirer of ups freight information technology expenses payment processing fees and the write down of certain construction in progress activities 

these increases were partially offset by reductions in selfinsured automobile liability claims due to improvements in claims experience a reduction in our allowance for credit losses and a reduction in purchases of covidrelated safety and cleaning supplies

other income and expense 

the following table sets forth investment income expense and other and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions   



investment income expense and other 

investment and other income increased 96 billion primarily due to a net 33 billion marktomarket gain from remeasurements of our defined benefit plans in 2021 compared to a 65 billion loss in 2020 excluding the impact of these marktomarket gains and losses adjusted investment and other income decreased 138 million driven by a decrease in other pension income which includes expected returns on pension assets net of interest cost on projected benefit obligations and prior service costs 

• expected returns on pension assets decreased due to a reduction in our expected rate of return assumption this was partially offset by a higher asset base due to discretionary contributions and positive asset returns in 2020 

• pension interest cost decreased driven by a reduction in projected benefit obligations following interim plan remeasurements the interim plan remeasurements were triggered by the signing into law of the arpa in march 2021 and by the divestiture of ups freight in april 2021 we also experienced a reduction in prior service cost 

the remaining items in other income decreased due to foreign currency losses partially offset by net gains from certain noncurrent investments 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year decreased due to lower average outstanding debt balances and lower effective interest rates on floating rate debt and commercial paper partially offset by a reduction in capitalization of interest

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 we had 106 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we believe that these positions expected cash from operations access to commercial paper programs and capital markets and other available liquidity options will be adequate to fund our material short and longterm cash requirements including our business operations planned capital expenditures and pension contributions transformation strategy costs debt obligations and planned shareowner returns we regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure including through issuances of debt to refinance existing debt and to fund operations we deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation including returns to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases 

cash flows from operating activities

a represents depreciation and amortization gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign currency exchange deferred income taxes allowances for expected credit losses amortization of operating lease assets pension and postretirement benefit plan income expense stock compensation expense changes in casualty selfinsurance reserves goodwill and other asset impairment charges and other noncash items 

net cash from operating activities increased 45 billion year to date primarily due to improved performance additional impacts included 

• contributions to our companysponsored pension and us postretirement medical benefit plans totaled 576 million and 31 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively this included discretionary contributions of 200 million and 28 billion respectively 

• our net hedge margin collateral position increased by 779 million due to changes in the fair value of derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs 

• cash payments for income taxes were 19 billion and 11 billion for 2021 and 2020 respectively with changes primarily driven by an increase in income 

• during 2020 our working capital benefited from a onetime deferral of employer payroll taxes of approximately 11 billion under the cares act during the fourth quarter of 2021 we paid 577 million of these deferred employer payroll taxes other changes in working capital were driven by business growth and the timing of duty and tax settlements 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our working capital efficiency certain financial institutions offer a supply chain finance scf program to certain of our suppliers we agree to commercial terms with our suppliers including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreedupon contractual terms if they participate in the scf program our suppliers at their sole discretion determine which invoices if any to sell to the financial institutions our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms no guarantees are provided by us under the scf program we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions as it relates to the scf program

amounts due to our suppliers that participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets we have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of december 31 2021 and 2020 suppliers sold them 545 and 639 million respectively of our outstanding payment obligations amounts due to suppliers that participate in the scf program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows the amounts settled through the scf program were approximately 17 and 18 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 31 billion of our total worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the us without any us federal income taxes any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and us state taxes when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash from investing activities for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were as follows in millions 

1 in addition to capital expenditures of 42 and 54 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively there were capital expenditures relating to principal repayments of finance lease obligations of 208 and 192 million respectively these are included in cash flows from financing activities 

we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions our current investment program anticipates investments in technology initiatives and enhanced network capabilities including over 1 billion of projects to support our environmental sustainability goals it also provides for maintenance of buildings facilities and plant equipment and replacement of certain aircraft within our fleet we currently expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately 55 billion in 2022 of which approximately 60 percent will be allocated to expansion projects 

in 2021 capital expenditures on buildings facilities and operating equipment decreased in our global small package business as we reduced spending on facility expansion projects capital spending on aircraft increased slightly as final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft were largely offset by reductions in contract deposits on open aircraft orders capital expenditures on information technology decreased due to the timing of projects 

proceeds from the disposal of businesses property plant and equipment increased as we completed the divestiture of ups freight for cash proceeds of 848 million in the second quarter the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 

the net change in finance receivables was primarily due to reductions in outstanding balances within our finance portfolios purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions in 2021 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of roadie and the purchase of development areas for the ups store cash paid for business acquisitions in 2020 related to the purchase of development areas for the ups store other investing activities were impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments purchase contract deposits and various other items

we have 20 billion of fixed and floating rate notes that mature in 2022 we may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings depending on various factors we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program in millions 





as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding balances under our us and european commercial paper program 

except as disclosed in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was driven by the number of stock options exercised by employees and movements in other employeerelated plans in 2021 and 2020 

other financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested stock awards of 358 and 340 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in cash used was driven by changes in payment levels for certain of our awards

we anticipate making discretionary contributions to our companysponsored us pension and postretirement benefit plans of approximately 19 billion in 2022 which are included within expected employer contributions to plan trusts shown in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements there are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including plan asset returns discount rates other actuarial assumptions changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process 

we have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements additionally we have 20 billion of fixed and floatingrate senior notes that mature in 2022 we may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings depending on various factors annual principal payments on our longterm debt estimated debt interest obligations and purchase commitments are also set out in note 10

critical accounting estimates 

the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with gaap we base our estimates on prior experience current trends various other assumptions and thirdparty input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ materially from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following critical accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

from time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings and have exposure to various other contingent obligations the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we apply judgment when establishing a range of reasonably possible losses for our contingencies our judgment is influenced by our understanding of information currently available for legal actions and potential outcomes of these actions including the advice from our internal counsel external counsel and senior management  

we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable for such accruals we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses however when there appears to be a range of equally possible losses our accrual is based on the lowend of this range the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a reasonable estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available additionally events may arise that were not anticipated and as a result the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss that differs materially from our previously estimated liability except as disclosed in note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of or for the year ended december 31 2021 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of or for the year ended december 31 2021 because a loss was not reasonably estimable obligations relating to income taxes and selfinsurance are discussed below 

goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the determination of reporting units requires judgment and if we changed the definition of our reporting units it is possible that we would have reached different conclusions when performing our impairment tests 

we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment this assessment uses a combination of income and market approaches 

• the income approach uses a discounted cash flow “dcf” model which requires us to make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures working capital and the cost of capital we are also required to make assumptions relating to our overall business and operating strategy and the regulatory and market environment changes in any of these assumptions could significantly impact the fair value of any one of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

• the market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as enterprise value to net sales we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations size and operating results of our reporting units changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units 

for reporting units tested using a quantitative model during 2021 we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 percent our truckload brokerage reporting unit was most sensitive to changes in valuation assumptions the ratio of excess fair value of this reporting unit to its carrying value would decrease by approximately one percentage point if the cost of capital increased by ten basis points

goodwill impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2021 during 2020 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 494 million in our ups freight reporting unit in conjunction with our evaluation of assets held for sale which is discussed in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the indefinitelived trade name associated with our truckload brokerage business for impairment using the relief from royalty method this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value including projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount 

our annual impairment test for the current year indicated that the fair value of the indefinitelived trade name remained greater than its carrying value although this excess was less than 10 percent our valuation estimate was most sensitive to changes in royalty rates and the cost of capital the ratio of excess fair value to carrying value would decrease by approximately one percentage point if the royalty rate decreased by five basis points or the cost of capital increased by ten basis points our truckload brokerage business has been negatively impacted by increases in the market rates at which it purchases transportation which has in turn negatively impacted its operating margins business performance below current forecasts or unfavorable changes in valuation assumptions such as a lower royalty rate or higher cost of capital could result in an impairment of the trade name in the future 

our finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are estimated using a dcf model if impairment indicators are present the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations see note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements for details of finitelived intangible asset impairments 

selfinsurance accruals 

we base selfinsurance reserves on actuarial estimates which are determined with the assistance of thirdparty actuaries through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions the process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity and changes in claims handling practices among other factors 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to resolve consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim several factors can affect the actual cost or severity of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in healthcare costs the results of any related litigation and changes in legislation furthermore claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior policy period at a rate that differs from actuarial projections all these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results we increased our total reserves related to prior year claims by 34 million and 169 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

due to the complexity and inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation of our workers’ compensation automobile and general liability claims the thirdparty actuary develops a range of expected losses we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate however actual experience in claim frequency andor severity of a claim could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

we also sponsor several health and welfare insurance plans for our employees liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans global health events anticipated utilization by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation we believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results

selfinsurance reserves as of december 31 2021 and 2020 were as follows in millions 



1 included within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

a five percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity and claim frequency rates used to estimate our selfinsurance reserves would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 290 million respectively in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 

pension and other postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trend rates inflation compensation increases expected returns on plan assets mortality rates regulatory requirements and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 

• changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 

• differences between expected and the actual return on plan assets 

• changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 

• differences in participant experience from demographic assumptions and 

• changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense upon remeasurement of a plan the remaining components of pension expense referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2021 we had 335 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which was aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates of the expected useful lives and residual values we evaluate the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets our accounting policy for longlived assets is set out in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

in estimating the useful lives and expected residual values of aircraft we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections for our air products adverse changes in volume forecasts or a shortfall in our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft resulting in an impairment charge or a reduction of the expected useful life of an aircraft that may result in increased depreciation expense revisions to estimates of useful lives and residual values could also be caused by changes to our maintenance programs governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we monitor our longlived assets for indicators of impairment which may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset if circumstances are present that indicate the carrying value of our longlived assets may not be recoverable we then perform impairment testing at the asset group level 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

asset groups represent the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified determining the asset group requires judgment and changes in the way asset groups are defined could have material impact to the results of impairment testing we perform recoverability testing by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate details of longlived asset impairments are included in note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments these financial instruments are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis based upon a fair value hierarchy levels 1 2 and 3 fair values are based on listed market prices level 1 when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations level 2 if listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability level 3 certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations further information on our accounting polices relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either level 1 or level 2 refer to notes 3 10 and 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report 

within our pension assets we hold investments in hedge risk parity private debt private equity and real estate funds which are primarily measured using net asset value nav as a practical expedient for fair value as appropriate these investments were valued at 96 billion as of december 31 2021 in order to estimate nav we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and december 31st these investments are not actively traded and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions if our estimates of activity changed this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report refer to note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension assets 

certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets these assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale 

in accounting for business acquisitions we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value for example estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions including but not limited to future expected cash flows from identified intangible assets synergies and the cost of capital certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we may utilize a variety of commodity foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instruments is provided in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our results either positively or negatively in the shortterm as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we may use forward contracts as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments and debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we may also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floatingrate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



1 the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 

2 the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 

the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in critical accounting estimates  the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables and marketable securities due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2021 or 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision you should carefully consider the following risk factors which may have materially affected or could materially affect us including impacting our business financial condition results of operations stock price or credit rating as well as our reputation you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 these risks are not the only ones we face we could also be affected by other events factors or uncertainties that are unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to be material risks 

business and operating risks 

the outbreak and spread of the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has had a significant impact on us as well as on the operations financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers we are unable to predict the full extent to which the coronavirus will continue to adversely impact us 

the covid19 pandemic resulted in and is expected to continue to result in a substantial curtailment of business activities including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services weakened economic conditions supply chain disruptions significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets both in the united states and abroad the pandemic has significantly impacted and is expected to continue to significantly impact us and has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on the operations financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers 

because the ongoing severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the future impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict the impact of the pandemic will depend on evolving factors many of which are not within our control and to which we may not be able to effectively respond these risks include but are not limited to a significant reduction in revenue due to curtailment of business from our customers a significant increase in our expenses or a reduction in our operating margins due to longterm changes in the mix of our products and services effects from governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel and transportation and workforce pressures reductions in operating effectiveness due to employees working remotely unavailability of personnel the delay or cancellation of capital projects and related delays in or loss of expected benefits therefrom limited access to liquidity increased volatility and pricing in the capital and commercial paper markets further disruption of our global supply chains an impairment in the fair value of our assets an increase in our pension funding obligations and the effect of the pandemic on the creditworthiness of our customers further the covid19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from it could also precipitate or aggravate risk factors that we identify herein or affect our operations and financial performance in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material the occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in general economic conditions in the us and internationally may adversely affect us 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that result in general economic changes are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular we are affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and we could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy including without limitation the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic in addition there remains substantial economic uncertainty arising from the united kingdom’s departure from the european union the uk and the eu continue to negotiate their future relationship which could take several years to finalize the outcome of these negotiations could result in among other things transportation delays increased costs fewer goods being transported globally additional volatility in currency exchange rates and further regulations relating to among other things trade aviation and the transport of goods changes in general economic conditions or our inability to accurately forecast these changes could materially adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving we expect to continue to face significant competition which could materially adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving including in response to demand for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments we expect to continue to face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis current competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers large transportation and ecommerce companies that are making significant investments in their capabilities and start ups and other companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs some of whom are currently our customers competition may also come from other sources in the future including as new technologies are developed competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and from time to time may offer services or pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer additionally to sustain the level of services and value that we deliver to our customers from time to time we may raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures we could be materially adversely affected 

continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition as a result of consolidation competitors may increase their market share improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could materially adversely affect us 

changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us 

for the year ended december 31 2020 business from one customer amazoncom inc and its affiliates accounted for 133 of our consolidated revenues some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year customer impact on our revenue is based on factors such as product launches ecommerce or other industry trends including those related to the fourth quarter holiday season business combinations and the overall growth of a customers underlying business as well as any disruptions to their businesses these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities in addition certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party if all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate significantly change or be canceled this could materially adversely affect us 

failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us 

we maintain a large workforce and necessarily depend on the skills and continued service of our employees including our experienced management team we also regularly hire a large number of parttime and seasonal workers we must be able to attract engage develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce while controlling related labor costs and maintaining an environment that supports our core values our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous factors including turnover training costs regulatory changes market pressures unemployment levels and healthcare and other benefit costs if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales further increased workers compensation and automobile liability claims regulatory noncompliance losses of customers and diminution of our brand value or company culture which could materially adversely affect us 

in addition our strategic initiatives including transformation have and may in the future lead to the creation of fewer more impactful jobs as we strive to lower our cost to serve our inability to continue to retain experienced and motivated employees may also materially adversely affect us 

increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach which could materially adversely affect us 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could materially adversely affect us 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could materially adversely affect us 

many of our us employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters the teamsters our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements in addition some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements strikes work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs as a result customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may permanently lose customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could materially adversely affect us the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could materially adversely affect us 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and similar matters or attempts to connect our company to such issues either in the us or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and use of our services by customers social media accelerates and amplifies the scope of negative publicity and makes responding to negative claims more difficult damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have a material adverse effect on us and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant data breach or information technology system disruption could materially adversely affect us 

we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems including the internet and a number of internallydeveloped systems and applications to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data our franchise locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities 

in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the us and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the eu has enacted the general data protection regulation which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries have also enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

information technology systems ours as well as those of our franchisees acquired businesses and thirdparty service providers are susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to programming errors defects or other vulnerabilities power outages hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks ransomware attacks malware attacks theft misconduct by employees or other insiders telecommunications failures misuse human errors or other catastrophic events hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other interruptions in our business in addition the foregoing breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personally identifiable information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to prevent any of the events described above 

we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including our customers franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and thirdparty delivery services these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and information technology systems disruptions like those described above and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events these events could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to misuse or disclosure of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems or those of acquired businesses franchisees customers service providers or other thirdparties could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for us among other consequences our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted further disrupting our operations similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation fines sanctions or other penalties 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite our best efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions although to date we are unaware of a data breach or system disruption including a cyberattack that has been material to us we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future and our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could materially adversely affect us 

severe weather conditions or other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires earthquakes epidemics pandemics conflicts unrest or terrorist attacks have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business and result in decreased revenues customers may reduce shipments or our costs to operate our business may increase either of which could have a material adverse effect on us any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

economic political or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us 

we have significant international operations as a result we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments that are beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers govern our environmental impact or labor matters and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us 

changes in markets and our business plans have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets changes in business strategy government regulations and economic or market conditions have resulted from time to time and may in the future result in substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets for example in connection with our entry into a definitive agreement to divest our ups freight business we recognized a 629 million aftertax impairment charge as of december 31 2020 in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes have in the past and may in the future reduce our net income 

insurance and claims expense could materially affect us 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation selfinsured workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk continues to increase which has occurred in recent periods our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage 

our inability to effectively integrate any acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances or dispositions could materially adversely affect us 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances or may dispose of operations whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions will depend in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues or transactionrelated charges 

financial risks 

we are exposed to the effects of changing fuel and energy prices including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we utilize hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a shift from our higheryielding products to loweryielding products or an overall reduction in volume there can also be no assurance that hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war weatherrelated events or natural disasters actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in part ii “item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the statements of consolidated income the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in part i item 7  critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged and may have a material adverse effect on us  

the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate libor could have a material adverse effect on us 

certain of our debt and other financial instruments have interest rates tied to libor the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor has announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 however the ice benchmark administration in its capacity as administrator of us dollar libor has announced that it intends to extend publication of certain us dollar libor rates to june 2023 notwithstanding this possible extension a joint statement by key regulatory authorities calls on banks to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate after 2021 

at this time it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on our cost of capital any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are required to make significant capital and other investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic conditions these investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us further cost increases could materially adversely affect us 

our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our companysponsored benefit plan obligations continually increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and may require significant contributions to our benefit plans our national master agreement with the teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not materially adversely affect us 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts however in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors including investment performance healthcare inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have an obligation to pay significant coordinating benefits that were earned by ups employees in the central states pension fund the cspf for additional information on our potential liabilities related to the cspf see note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

we may have significant additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

regulatory and legal risks 

increasingly complex and stringent laws regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment safety privacy and data protection and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in other countries in which we operate in addition we are impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges recently trade discussions between the us and various of its trading partners have been fluid and existing and future trade agreements are and are expected to continue to be subject to a number of uncertainties including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs the impact of new laws regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with any new laws regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or policies in the us or in any of the other countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect us 

increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions exposes our transportation and logistics businesses to potentially significant new taxes fees and other costs compliance with such regulation and any increased or additional regulation or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change 

for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions under this decision all of our flights operating within the eu are covered by the ets requirements and we are required annually to purchase emission allowances in an amount exceeding the number of free allowances allocated to us under the ets similarly in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

in the us congress in the past several years has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions but these bills so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency could determine to regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us 

in addition the impact that the recent reentry into the paris climate accord may have on future us policy regarding ghg emissions on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain the extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have an adverse direct or indirect effect on us 

potential costs to us of increased regulation regarding ghg emissions in the us or abroad especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely we cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results it is possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

as described above during 2020 we began implementing our customer first people led innovation driven strategy as we seek to transform nearly every aspect of our business improve our financial performance provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners we focused on among other things enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most speed and ease of access to our services we completed enhancements to our us ground network to improve timeintransit and continued to deploy our digital access program into ecommerce platforms 

beginning in the first quarter of 2020 unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions implemented in many countries in response to the covid19 pandemic have significantly impacted the mix of demand for our services in our global small package business businesstobusiness activity has declined while we continue to experience a significant increase in the level of businesstoconsumer shipping which we partially attribute to the capability enhancements described above while businesstobusiness activity began to recover in the latter part of 2020 we believe that the market shift towards ecommerce will persist with a continuing high level of residential deliveries that may continue to increase demand but also drive higher operating costs the pandemic also resulted in a reduction in global air cargo capacity this caused market rates in the industry to increase and we experienced increased demand for our services 

on january 24 2021 we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our ups freight business this will allow us to be even more focused on the core parts of our business that drive the greatest value for our shareholders the transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals is expected to close during the second quarter of 2021 we expect this divestiture to result in an improvement to our operating margin and return on invested capital 

we believe that we are well positioned for longterm growth however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the timing and extent of the anticipated economic recovery and the resulting impacts on our business results or liquidity for additional information on these risks and uncertainties see part i item 1a risk factors of this report 

highlights of our results for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 which are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow include 



• revenue increased in all segments 

• average daily package volume increased due to increases in businesstoconsumer shipping 

• operating expenses increased due to volume growth 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

• operating profit and operating margin were relatively flat and included goodwill and other asset impairment charges of 686 million related to the anticipated divestiture of ups freight 

• we reported net income of 13 billion and diluted earnings per share of 154 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 823 after adjusting for the aftertax impacts of 

◦ goodwill and other asset impairment charges of 629 million or 072 per share 

◦ transformation strategy costs of 265 million or 031 per share and 

◦ pension marktomarket losses recognized outside of a 10 corridor of 49 billion or 566 per share 

in the us domestic package segment volume and revenue growth was highest in our residential ground products the increase in residential delivery volume drove increases in headcount delivery stops per day average daily miles driven and average daily union labor hours all of which increased expense and compressed operating margins as described below operating expenses also increased as a result of the investments we made to improve our ground network 

the international package segment experienced volume and revenue growth driven by strong outbound demand from asia as well as growth from ecommerce within europe residential delivery volume growth drove an increase in thirdparty pickup and delivery expense 

in the supply chain  freight segment growth was primarily driven by our forwarding and mail services businesses the forwarding business benefited from strong outbound demand from asia and the implementation of capacity surcharges as covid19 led to reduced capacity in the air cargo market mail services benefited from the increase in ecommerce activity and favorable changes in shipment characteristics we also experienced growth in demand for our healthcare logistics and distribution solutions partly driven by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic

supplemental information  items affecting comparability 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate net income and earnings per share adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities amounts related to marktomarket gains or losses restructuring costs including transformation strategy costs and costs related to certain legal contingencies and expenses as described below we believe that these adjusted financial measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determination 

adjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap our adjusted financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting therefore our adjusted financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax benefit from restructuring and other costs legal contingencies and expenses and marktomarket charges are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the taxdeductible adjustments the blended average of the effective tax rates in 2020 and 2019 was 225 and 232 respectively

impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities 

we supplement the reporting of our revenue revenue per piece and operating profit with nongaap measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities 

currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit the derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities the difference between the current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations 

restructuring and other charges 

we supplement the presentation of our operating profit operating margin income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with similar nongaap measures that exclude the impact of charges related to restructuring activities including transformation strategy costs and asset impairments for more information regarding transformation strategy costs see note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding asset impairments see note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

costs related to certain legal contingencies and expenses 

we supplement the presentation of our operating profit operating margin income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with similar nongaap measures that exclude the impact of costs related to certain legal contingencies and expenses 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charges 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of other pension income expense we supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with nongaap measures that exclude the impact of gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor and the related income tax effects we believe excluding these marktomarket impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with shortterm changes in market interest rates equity values and similar factors 

this adjusted net periodic benefit cost 641 million in 2020 and 754 million in 2019 utilizes the expected return on plan assets 770 in 2020 and 768 in 2019 and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 355 in 2020 and 445 in 2019 the unadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets 1254 in 2020 and 1757 in 2019 and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date 287 in 2020 and 355 in 2019 

we recognized pretax marktomarket losses outside of a 10 corridor related to the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans assets and liabilities in other income and expense of 65 and 24 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2019 we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques discussed in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements

results of operations 

the table below shows the amounts associated with each component of the pretax marktomarket loss as well as the weightedaverage actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost for each year 



the pretax marktomarket losses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following 

2020  65 billion pretax marktomarket loss 

• discount rates 65 billion pretax loss the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 355 as of december 31 2019 to 287 as of december 31 2020 primarily due to a decline in us treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on aarated corporate bonds 

• return on assets 24 billion pretax gain in 2020 the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return primarily due to strong global equity and us bond market performance 

• demographic and other assumption changes 381 million pretax loss this represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors including items such as healthcare cost trends compensation rate increases and rates of termination retirement and mortality 

• coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund 20 billion pretax loss this represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund 

2019  24 billion pretax marktomarket loss 

• discount rates 57 billion pretax loss the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 445 as of december 31 2018 to 355 as of december 31 2019 primarily due to a decline in us treasury yields and a decrease in credit spreads on aarated corporate bonds in 2019 this was partially offset by a refinement to the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement plans as described in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

• return on assets 39 billion pretax gain in 2019 the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return primarily due to strong global equity and us bond market performance 

• demographic and other assumption changes 24 million pretax loss this represented the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors including items such as healthcare cost trends compensation rate increases and rates of termination retirement and mortality 

• coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund 543 million pretax loss this represented our thenbest estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund

expense allocations 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments using activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates would directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment our allocation methodologies are refined periodically as necessary to reflect changes in our businesses beginning in 2020 we updated our cost allocation methodology for the ground with freight pricing gfp product the cost associated with gfp that is allocated from the us domestic package segment to ups freight within the supply chain  freight segment was adjusted to better reflect operational activities associated with this product this change in methodology had only an immaterial impact on the expense allocated to ups freight for 2020 there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodologies during 2019 or 2018

results of operations 

volume 

2020 compared to 2019 

volume increased across all products with growth strongest in residential ground services volume growth was primarily driven by businesstoconsumer ecommerce which grew by approximately 33 partly due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic we also benefited from the impact of two additional operating days in 2020 volume growth was led by our largest customer amazon with growth stronger in the first half of the year we also experienced growth from smbs as well as other large customers volume from smbs grew 148 for the year with growth accelerating in the second half of the year as a result of our investments to improve both timeintransit and our digital access platform 

businesstoconsumer shipments represented approximately 64 of total average daily volume for the year compared to approximately 54 in 2019 we believe that the covid19 pandemic has accelerated a change in consumer behavior speeding up what we believe will be a longterm market shift towards ecommerce businesstobusiness shipments decreased 10 for the year primarily in our ground products as many businesses experienced disruption and periods of closure due to the pandemic businesstobusiness activity began to recover in the latter part of 2020 

average daily volume increased in both our next day air and deferred products driven by increased residential demand as a result of the growth in ecommerce this was slightly offset by declines in businesstobusiness shipments primarily as a result of covid19 as well as continued declines in second day letter volume due to ongoing shifts in customer preferences 

residential ground and surepost average daily volumes increased by 35 and 39 respectively for the year driven by changes in customer mix and the growth in ecommerce activity ground commercial average daily volume declined as many businesses temporarily closed or operated on a limited basis as a result of covid19 

rates and product mix 

2020 compared to 2019 

overall revenue per piece increased due to changes in base rates customer and product mix and residential surcharges that went into effect in october 2020 partially offset by declines in fuel surcharges rates for ups ground and ups air services increased an average net 49 in december 2019 surepost rates increased effective october 2020 

revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased primarily due to shifts in customer and product mix lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in average billable weight per piece revenue per piece for our ground products increased primarily due to the shift in customer mix with a significant increase in smb volume and higher residential surcharges these benefits were partially offset by shifts in product mix lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in average billable weight per piece 

fuel surcharges 

we apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  

while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of products sold the base price and any additional charges or discounts on these services 

total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 344 million for the year as a result of lower fuel surcharge indices partially offset by increases in volume and shifts in product mix

operating expenses 

2020 compared to 2019 

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses increased largely due to higher pickup and delivery costs up 42 billion in addition the costs of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network increased 14 billion costs of package sorting increased 927 million and other indirect operating costs increased 744 million the overall increase in expense was driven by several factors 

• employee compensation and benefit costs increased 50 billion largely resulting from 

◦ residential volume growth that negatively impacted our delivery density driving an increase in package delivery stops per day and in average daily miles driven this drove an increase in average daily union labor hours of 141 

◦ union pay rate increases 

◦ growth in the overall size of the workforce and 

◦ acceleration of certain previouslyissued incentive compensation awards for certain nonexecutive employees that resulted in additional expense of approximately 104 million 

we also incurred higher employee benefit expenses due to additional headcount contractual contribution rate increases to union multiemployer plans and higher service costs for our companysponsored pension and postretirement plans primarily driven by lower discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligations of these plans workers compensation expense increased 114 million as a result of additional hours medical and wage inflation and claims experience 

• higher thirdparty transportation costs were driven by increased surepost volume and utilization of outside carriers as part of our improvements to timeintransit within our us ground network 

• we incurred lower fuel costs for the year driven by lower prices for jet fuel diesel and gasoline that were partially offset by increased usage as a result of volume growth and higher average daily miles driven 

total cost per piece and adjusted cost per piece excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses increased 28 as a result of the factors described above 

operating profit and margin 

2020 compared to 2019 

as a result of the factors described above operating profit decreased 273 million with operating margins decreasing 170 basis points to 73 excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses adjusted operating profit decreased 241 million with operating margins decreasing 170 basis points to 77

volume 

2020 compared to 2019 

average daily volume increased for both domestic and export products businesstoconsumer volume increased as the covid19 pandemic drove growth in ecommerce businesstobusiness volume declined as the pandemic negatively impacted business operations globally however we experienced a slight increase in volumes in the fourth quarter 

average daily volume growth was driven primarily by strong demand from the retail and technology sectors due to the increase in ecommerce activity this was partially offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and other sectors as covid19 caused a decline in commercial activity 

export volume increased across most major trade lanes driven by europe and asia europe export volume growth was highest on the europe to us trade lane with intraeurope volumes also growing significantly asia export volume growth was strongest on the asia to us trade lane we experienced volume growth from both our large customers and smbs with smb growth accelerating during the second half of the year our premium products saw volume growth primarily driven by our worldwide express product however growth was stronger in our nonpremium products such as world wide expedited and transborder standard due to shifts in customer preference for these products 

domestic volume increased in many of our markets driven by growth in canada and several european countries that was primarily due to residential volume growth resulting from the increase in ecommerce 

rates and product mix 

2020 compared to 2019 

rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market in response to market capacity constraints resulting from the covid19 pandemic we implemented surcharges on certain lanes during the year in december 2019 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states 

total revenue per piece increased 04 as a result of changes in customer and product mix the impact of demand surcharges and currency movements which were largely offset by a decline in fuel surcharges excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece decreased 05 

domestic revenue per piece increased 22 due to changes in customer and product mix demand surcharges and currency movements that were partially offset by a decline in fuel surcharges excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece increased 12 

export revenue per piece decreased 20 primarily due to a decline in fuel surcharges that were partially offset by changes in demand surcharges excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece decreased 28 

fuel surcharges 

we apply fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services the fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the us is largely indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel the fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the us are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates 

while fluctuations can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and extra service charges and the pricing discounts offered total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 263 million in 2020 as a result of declines in fuel surcharge indices partially offset by volume growth and changes in customer and product mix

operating expenses 

2020 compared to 2019 

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs increased in 2020 pickup and delivery costs increased 540 million due to volume growth and an increase in residential deliveries that drove additional thirdparty pickup and delivery expense 

the costs of operating our integrated international air and ground network increased 66 million as increased block hours were partially offset by lower fuel prices 

in addition to variability in usage and market prices the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of costs on our results the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm 

the remaining increase in operating expenses in 2020 was due to package sorting and other indirect operating costs 

operating profit and margin 

2020 compared to 2019 

as a result of the factors described above operating profit increased 779 million with operating margin increasing 280 basis points to 215 excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs  adjusted operating profit increased for the year with operating margin increasing 270 basis points to 222

revenue 

2020 compared to 2019 

total revenue in the supply chain  freight segment increased 18 billion the impact of the covid19 pandemic varied within the segment our ltl business faced excess capacity and reduced demand in the first half of the year before market conditions began to improve conversely our international air freight forwarding business benefited from demand for personal protective equipment out of asia as well as increases in market rates caused by a sharp decline in passenger aircraft cargo capacity our logistics business experienced increased demand from the healthcare and retail sectors while activity in other sectors declined 

overall forwarding revenue increased for the year in our international air freight business revenue grew as a result of higher market rates capacity surcharges and strong demand in asia ocean freight forwarding revenue increased due to asiaexport volume growth in the second half of the year revenue in our truckload brokerage business increased as volume levels recovered in the third and fourth quarters higher demand together with capacity constraints in the truckload brokerage market drove rate increases 

within logistics revenue in our mail services business increased as a result of ecommerce growth which also led to a favorable shift in product characteristics in addition we implemented a peak surcharge in mail services in the fourth quarter which contributed to the overall increase in revenue in the healthcare sector we experienced growth in demand for our healthcare logistics and distribution solutions partly driven by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

ups freight revenue declined due to volume and tonnage declines in our ltl business driven by overall market conditions as well as volume optimization initiatives that resulted in an increase in revenue per hundredweight revenue from the ground with freight pricing product grew as volume levels increased in the second half of the year 

revenue from the other businesses within the segment increased driven by growth within ups customer solutions as well as additional volume from service contracts with the us postal service 

operating expenses

total operating expenses for the segment and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of restructuring and other costs increased in 2020 

forwarding operating expenses increased 11 billion largely due to higher market rates and additional charter flights out of asia which increased purchased transportation expense for international air freight this increase was slightly offset by declines in tonnage and volume in truckload brokerage volume growth and higher market rates also contributed to the increase in purchased transportation expense other expenses decreased slightly as a result of ongoing cost management initiatives 

logistics operating expenses increased 582 million driven by higher purchased transportation expense in mail services as a result of volume growth and carrier rate increases as well as volume growth in the healthcare sector 

ups freight operating expenses increased 607 million due primarily to an impairment charge of 686 million in respect of goodwill and assets held for sale as a result of entering into an agreement to divest our ups freight business we expect this divestiture to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 

operating profit and margin 

2020 compared to 2019 

as a result of the factors described above total operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment decreased 620 million excluding the year over year impact of restructuring and other costs adjusted operating profit increased 56 million operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 24 while adjusted operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 70

• international package expense increased 521 million primarily due to volume increases in asia and europe that drove higher thirdparty pickup and delivery cost as well as additional charter flights originating from asia 

fuel 

2020 compared to 2019 

the decrease in fuel expense was driven by lower prices for jet fuel diesel and gasoline these decreases were partially offset by higher consumption due to increases in aircraft block hours and miles driven as a result of increased volume as well as the impact of higher alternative fuel tax credits in 2019 

other occupancy 

2020 compared to 2019 

the increase in other occupancy expense and other occupancy expense excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs was driven by additional operating facilities coming into service rent and property tax increases and ongoing facility maintenance

cash flows from operating activities

a represents depreciation and amortization gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign currency exchange deferred income taxes allowances for expected credit losses amortization of operating lease assets pension and postretirement benefit expense stock compensation expense changes in casualty selfinsurance reserves goodwill and other asset impairment charges and other noncash items 

net cash from operating activities increased 18 billion for the year driven by the following 

• total contributions to our companysponsored pension and us postretirement medical benefit plans were 31 billion during 2020 compared to 24 billion in 2019 we made discretionary contributions of 28 billion to our three primary companysponsored us pension plans during 2020 compared to 20 billion in 2019 

• our net hedge margin collateral decreased by 678 million due to the change in net fair value of derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs 

• cash payments for income taxes were 11 billion and 514 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively with changes driven by the timing of deductions related to pension contributions depreciation and employer payroll taxes 

• favorable changes in working capital were driven by the deferral of approximately 11 billion of employer payroll taxes under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act that was signed into law on march 27 2020 as well as changes in incentive compensation plan payouts these benefits were partially offset by an increase in working capital demand as a result of business growth 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our working capital efficiency certain financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance scf program to certain of our suppliers we agree commercial terms with our suppliers including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreedupon contractual terms then if they are participating in the scf program our suppliers at their sole discretion determine which invoices if any to sell to the financial institutions our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms no guarantees are provided by us under the scf program we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions as it relates to the scf program

amounts due to our suppliers that participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets we have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of december 31 2020 and 2019 suppliers sold them 639 and 268 million respectively of our outstanding payment obligations amounts due to suppliers that participate in the scf program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows the amount settled through the scf program was approximately 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 

as of december 31 2020 our total worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 63 billion of which approximately 30 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the us without any us federal income taxes any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and us state taxes when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 

1 in addition to capital expenditures of 54 and 64 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively there were capital expenditures relating to principal repayments of finance lease obligations of 192 and 140 million these are included in cash flows from financing activities 

we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions our current investment program anticipates maintenance of buildings facilities and plant equipment as well as investments in technology initiatives and additional network capabilities we currently expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately 40 billion in 2021 

in 2020 capital expenditures on buildings facilities and plant equipment decreased in our global small package business as we reduced spending on facility automation and capacity expansion projects capital spending on aircraft decreased due to reductions in contract deposits on open aircraft orders and in final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft 

proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely attributable to sales of international property in 2020 and 2019 the net change in finance receivables was primarily due to reductions in outstanding balances within our finance portfolios purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions in 2020 related to the acquisition of area franchise rights for the ups store in 2019 we also acquired area franchise rights for the ups store as well as made immaterial acquisitions in our international small package and healthcare logistics business units other investing activities were impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments purchase contract deposits and various other items 

we anticipate that the divestiture of ups freight will be completed in the second quarter of 2021 we intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repay outstanding debt

cash flows from financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 

we repurchased a total of 21 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 217 million in 2020 substantially all of those purchases were in the first quarter of 2020 as previously disclosed we have suspended share repurchases under our stock repurchase program we repurchased 91 million shares for 10 billion throughout 2019 224 million and 10 billion in repurchases for 2020 and 2019 respectively are reported on the statement of cash flows due to the timing of settlements for additional information on our share repurchase activities see note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements

issuances of debt in 2020 and 2019 consisted of borrowings under our commercial paper program and issuances of fixedrate senior notes as follows in millions 

repayments of debt in 2020 included our 424 million 8375 debentures that matured in april 2020 and our €500 million floating rate senior notes that matured in july 2020 we also paid down commercial paper and made scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations repayments of debt in 2019 included fixedrate senior notes in the amount of 10 billion commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations 

we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt we have 26 billion of senior notes that mature in 2021 we do not currently intend to refinance this debt when it becomes due 

the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program in millions 





the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the number of stock option exercises by employees in 2020 and 2019

other financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares from employees sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested stock awards of 340 and 180 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in cash used was driven by changes in the vesting schedule for certain of our awards net cash inflows from premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 0 and 21 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

sources of credit 

see note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and debt covenants 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

except as disclosed in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations primarily through the use of cash flows from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 in millions 



1 operating lease commitments for 2021 include 184 million of committed leases that have not yet commenced 

our finance lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate finance leases and operating leases are discussed further in note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt and variable rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31 2020 the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of any interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets goods or services that are legally binding including contracts for aircraft construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2020 we had firm commitments to purchase three new boeing 767300 aircraft to be delivered in 2021 and 8 new boeing 7478f aircraft to be delivered between 2021 and 2022 we also had a firm commitment to purchase two boeing md11 aircraft to be delivered in 2021 we paid a deposit equal to the full purchase price for these md11 aircraft in december 2019 therefore these aircraft are not included in the commitment table above 

in december 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries we elected to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the tax act and as required have reflected our remaining transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation

there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates other actuarial assumptions and changes to pension plan funding regulations a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in equity or bond returns could result in our us pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2021 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the table above does not include approximately 398 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 14 billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2020 we had 13 billion of surety bonds written as of december 31 2020 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 52 million associated with ups capital

critical accounting estimates 

this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with gaap as indicated in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with gaap we base our estimates on prior experience current trends various other assumptions and thirdparty input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ materially from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and subject to various contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability this difference could be material income taxes and selfinsurance are discussed below except as disclosed in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements other contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of or for the year ended december 31 2020 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of or for the year ended december 31 2020 because a loss was not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of july 1st and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level initially evaluating qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we record the excess amount as goodwill impairment not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit our reporting units are set out in note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow “dcf” model and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures working capital and our cost of capital we are also required to make assumptions relating to our overall business and operating strategy and the regulatory and market environment the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our forecasts business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 494 million for our ups freight reporting unit in 2020 in conjunction with our evaluation of assets held for sale which is discussed in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements based on the most recent tests the fair value of our remaining reporting units exceeds their carrying value none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200 million and licenses with a carrying value of 5 million as of december 31 2020 are considered to be indefinitelived intangibles we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method to estimate the fair value of the trade name this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value these assumptions include projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount 

all of our remaining intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived and are amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are estimated using a dcf model if impairment indicators are present the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations see note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements for details of finitelived intangible asset impairments 

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automobile liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are based on thirdparty actuarial estimates which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of our reserves 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the severity and length of time the claim remains open trends in healthcare costs the results of any related litigation and changes in legislation furthermore claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections all of these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results based on our historical experience in 2019 we changed our selfinsurance reserves from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of losses we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations for additional information on our selfinsurance reserves refer to note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of among other things the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans global health events anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation we believe our estimates are reasonableappropriate actual experience may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

pension and other postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trend rates inflation compensation increases expected returns on plan assets mortality rates regulatory requirements and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups in 2019 we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques as discussed in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 in millions

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2020 we had 323 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates of the expected useful lives and residual values we review longlived assets for impairment at either the individual asset level or the asset group for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified impairment reviews occur when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate there were no material impairment charges on our fixed assets during 2020 or 2019 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we rely upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance programs changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft resulting in an impairment charge or a reduction of the expected useful life of an aircraft that may result in increased depreciation expense 

we evaluate the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets see note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for longlived assets 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations if listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets these assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale 

for business acquisitions we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we may utilize a variety of commodity foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage intermodal and truckload services the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our results either positively or negatively in the shortterm as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forward contracts as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floatingrate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm interest rates for a discussion of the risks associated with the anticipated cessation of libor see part i item 1a risk factors  financial risks  the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate libor could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



1 the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 

2 the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 

the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables and marketable securities due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2020 or 2019

government regulation 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate key laws and regulations are summarized below 

air operations 

the us department of transportation “dot” the federal aviation administration “faa” and the us department of homeland security through the transportation security administration “tsa” have regulatory authority over our air transportation services the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended is the statutory basis for dot and faa authority and the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended is the basis for tsa aviation security authority 

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as operations authority insurance requirements pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad international operating rights for us airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the us and foreign governments or in the absence of such agreements by principles of reciprocity we are also subject to current and potential aviation regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate including registration and license requirements and security regulations we have international route operating rights granted by the dot and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network the efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on dot and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions 

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including certification aircraft operating procedures transportation of hazardous materials record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable faa regulations in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights involving nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation 

upss aircraft maintenance programs and procedures including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals are approved for all aircraft under faa regulations the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition age and the enactment of additional faa regulatory requirements 

the tsa regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the tsa mission statement to “protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce” our airport and offairport locations as well as our personnel facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with tsa regulations 

ups airlines along with a number of other us domestic airlines participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program our participation in the craf program allows the us department of defense “dod” to requisition specified ups airlines aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency the dod is required to compensate us for the use of aircraft under the craf program in addition participation in craf entitles us to bid for other us government opportunities including small package and air freight 

ground operations 

our ground transportation of packages in the us is subject to regulation by the dot and its agency the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” ground transportation also falls under state jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations safety and insurance our ground transportation of hazardous materials in the us is subject to regulation by the dots pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration we also must comply with safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the fmcsa including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service for drivers we are subject to similar regulation in many nonus jurisdictions 

the postal reorganization act of 1970 created the us postal service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government and created the postal rate commission an independent agency to recommend postal rates the postal accountability and enhancement act of 2006 amended the 1970 act to give the renamed postal regulatory commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the postal service including postal rates product offerings and service standards we sometimes participate in proceedings before the postal regulatory commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services 

our ground operations are also subject to compliance with various cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the us department of homeland security including regulation by the tsa 

customs 

we are subject to the customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments in the countries in which we operate including those related to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters our activities in the us including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection the tsa the us federal maritime commission and the dot our international operations are subject to similar regulatory structures in their respective jurisdictions 

environmental 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units these laws and regulations cover a variety of processes including but not limited to properly storing handling and disposing of waste materials appropriately managing waste water and stormwater monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks complying with laws regarding clean air including those governing emissions protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders we have established site and activityspecific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant in addition we have created numerous programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations 

pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise our aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations our international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain countries in which we operate 

communications and data protection 

because of our extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in our aircraft and ground transportation operations we are subject to the federal communications act of 1934 as amended in addition the federal communications commission regulates and licenses our activities pertaining to satellite communications there has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and in other countries for example the european union “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and increases the requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in significant fines other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws and are considering data localization laws that would govern the use of data outside of their respective jurisdictions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

our business financial condition and results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties in connection with any investment decision you should carefully consider the following significant factors which could materially affect us including impacting our business financial condition results of operations stock price or credit rating as well as our reputation you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 these risks are not the only ones we face we could also be affected by other events factors or uncertainties that are unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to be significant risks 

changes in general economic conditions in the us and internationally may adversely affect us 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that result in general economic changes are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and we could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy in addition there remains substantial economic uncertainty arising from the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union the uk and the eu continue to negotiate the future relationship between themselves which could take several years to finalize the outcome of these negotiations could result in among other things transportation delays fewer goods being transported globally additional volatility in currency exchange rates and further regulations relating to among other things trade aviation and the transport of goods any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving we expect to continue to face significant competition which could adversely affect us 

our industry is rapidly evolving including demand for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments we expect continued significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers large transportation and ecommerce companies that are making significant investments in their capabilities and start ups and other companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs some of whom may currently be our customers competition may also come from other sources in the future including as new technologies are developed competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and from time to time may offer services or pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer additionally to remain competitive from time to time we may have to raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures we could be adversely affected 

continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition as a result of consolidation competitors may increase their market share improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect us 

changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us 

for the year ended december 31 2019 one customer amazoncom and its affiliates accounted for 116 of our consolidated revenues some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year these customers can impact our revenues based on factors such as customer product launches ecommerce or other industry trends such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business combinations and the overall growth of a customers underlying business as well as any disruptions to their businesses these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities in addition certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party if all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or be canceled it could materially adversely affect us 

our business is subject to complex and stringent laws regulations and policies which could increase our operating costs 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment safety privacy and data protection and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in other countries in which we operate in addition we are impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges recently trade discussions between the us and various of its trading partners have been fluid and existing and future trade agreements are and are expected to continue to be subject to a number of uncertainties including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs the impact of new laws regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with any new laws or regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or policies in the us or in any of the other countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect us 

increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach which could materially adversely affect us 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could materially adversely affect us 

increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions exposes our transportation and logistics businesses to potentially significant new taxes fees and other costs compliance with such regulation and any increased or additional regulation or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change 

for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions under this decision all of our flights operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirements and we are required annually to purchase emission allowances in an amount exceeding the number of free allowances allocated to us under the ets similarly in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

in the us congress in the past several years has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions but these bills so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency “epa” spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act could determine to regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us 

in november 2019 the us began the process to withdraw from the paris climate accord an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions the effect of that withdrawal on future us policy regarding ghg emissions on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on us 

we may face additional regulations regarding ghg emissions internationally and in the united states potential costs to us of increased regulation regarding ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely we cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results it is possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect us 

many of our us employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements in addition some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements strikes work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs as a result customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could materially adversely affect us the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing fuel and energy prices including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and through hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume there can also be no assurance that hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged and may have a material adverse effect on us 

the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate libor could have an adverse effect on us 

certain of our debt and other financial instruments have interest rates tied to libor the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority has announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot be determined in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could adversely impact us 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and similar matters or attempts to connect our company to such issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and use of our services by customers social media accelerates and amplifies the scope of negative publicity and makes responding to negative claims more difficult damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have a material adverse effect on us and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant data breach or it system disruption could materially adversely affect us including requiring us to increase spending on data and system security 

we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems including the internet and a number of internallydeveloped systems and applications to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data our franchised center locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities 

in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches became effective in may 2018 other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

our information technology systems as well as those of our franchisees and acquired businesses are susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to programming errors defects or other vulnerabilities power outages hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks ransomware attacks malware attacks theft misconduct by employees or other insiders telecommunications failures misuse human errors or other catastrophic events hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other interruptions in our business in addition the foregoing breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to prevent any of the events described above 

we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including our customers and franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and thirdparty delivery services these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and it systems disruptions like those described above and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events these events could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to misuse or disclosure of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems or those of acquired businesses franchisees customers service providers or other thirdparties could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for us among other consequences our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted further disrupting our operations similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation fines sanctions or other penalties 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite our best efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions although to date we are unaware of a data breach or system disruption including a cyberattack that has been material to us we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future and our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect us 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires earthquakes epidemics pandemics conflicts unrest or terrorist attacks may disrupt our business and result in decreased revenues customers may reduce shipments or our costs to operate our business may increase either of which could have a material adverse effect on us any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment these investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins 

economic political social developments and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect us 

we have significant international operations as a result we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments that are beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes have in the past and may in the future reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us further cost increases could materially and adversely affect us 

our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in healthcare costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations continually increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans our national master agreement with the teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not materially adversely affect us 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts however in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors including investment performance healthcare inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have significant additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund the cspf for additional information on our potential additional liabilities related to the cspf see note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions many aspects of the tax act remain unclear and may not be clarified for some time in addition many state jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on the state treatment of certain aspects of the tax act as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our tax rates and our financial position 

we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us 

our inability to effectively integrate acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances could adversely affect us 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues or transactionrelated charges 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

supplemental information  items affecting comparability 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap with certain nongaap financial measures including as applicable adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate net income and earnings per share adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities amounts related to marktomarket gains or losses recognition of contingencies and transformation strategy costs as described below we believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying operating results and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap our nongaap financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting therefore our nongaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax benefit from transformation strategy costs legal contingencies and expenses and the marktomarket charges are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the tax deductible adjustments the blended average of the effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 were 232 and 240 respectively

impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities 

we supplement the reporting of our revenue revenue per piece and operating profit with nongaap measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities 

currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit the derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities the difference between the current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations 

transformation strategy costs 

we supplement the presentation of our operating profit operating margin income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with similar nongaap measures that exclude the impact of costs related to restructuring programs including transformation strategy costs for information regarding transformation strategy costs see note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

costs related to legal contingencies and expenses 

we supplement the presentation of our operating profit operating margin income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with similar nongaap measures that exclude the impact of costs related to certain of our legal contingencies and expenses for information regarding legal contingencies and expenses see note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charges 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost we supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the portion of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor and the related income tax effects we believe excluding these marktomarket impacts from our adjusted results provides important supplemental information to remove the volatility caused by shortterm changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

this adjusted net periodic benefit cost 754 million in 2019 and 615 million in 2018 utilizes the expected return on plan assets 768 in 2019 and 2018 and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 445 in 2019 and 381 in 2018 the unadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets 1757 in 2019 and 238 in 2018 and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the december 31 measurement date 355 in 2019 and 445 in 2018 

we recognized pretax marktomarket losses outside of a 10 corridor related to the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans assets and liabilities in other income and expense of 2387 and 1627 billion for 2019 and 2018 respectively in october 2019 we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet by approximately 900 million as of december 31 2019 decreased the pretax marktomarket charge by approximately 810 million and increased net income by 616 million or 071 per share on a basic and diluted basis this change did not have an impact on adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share

expense allocations 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments using activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment our allocation methodologies are refined periodically as necessary to reflect changes in our businesses there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodologies during 2019  2018 or 2017

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

volume 

2019 compared to 2018 

our overall volume increased across all products led by strong growth in our next day air and deferred driven by the structural shift to faster delivery in retail and ecommerce and from additional customer volume we experienced growth from a number of large customers and smbs with volume growth led by our largest customer amazon this growth was enabled by our ongoing investment in automated facilities and other transformation initiatives 

businesstoconsumer shipments which represented approximately 54 of the total us domestic package average daily volume grew 113 for the year driven by the growth in ecommerce and retail volume grew across all products with particularly strong growth in our air products businesstobusiness shipments increased 22 for the year with volume increases in both air and ground services 

within our air products overall average daily volume increased in both next day air and deferred strong air volume growth continued primarily in residential next day air and second day package products as consumers and businesses continue to demand faster delivery options which we expect will persist this growth was slightly offset by declines in next day air letter and second day letter volume due to shifts in customer preferences 

we experienced year over year growth in both residential and commercial ground products growth in residential ground volume was driven by changes in customer mix resulting from the continued growth in ecommerce while growth in commercial ground products was primarily driven by an increase in retail return services 

rates and product mix 

2019 compared to 2018 

overall revenue per piece decreased due to customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates partially offset by changes in base rates 

revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 26 2018 ups ground and ups air services rates increased an average net 49 

revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased primarily due to a shift in customer and product mix and a decrease in average billable weight per piece which was partially offset by the increase in base rates 

revenue per piece for our ground products increased primarily due to base rate increases and customer and product mix partially offset by a decrease in average billable weight per piece 

fuel surcharges 

we apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  

effective april 2 2018 we created separate fuel surcharges for domestic air shipments and international air export shipments these surcharges are based on the us gulf coast jet fuel price and are adjusted weekly in june and october 2018 ground fuel surcharge rates were raised for all thresholds and in october and december 2018 domestic air fuel surcharge rates were increased for all thresholds ground surcharges continue to be based on the national us average onhighway diesel fuel price and adjusted weekly 

while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of products sold the base price and any additional charges or discounts on these services 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

revenue per piece for ground products was positively impacted by fuel surcharge rate increases during 2018 while fuel surcharge rates for air products decreased slightly for the year 

total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 140 million for the year as a result of increases in package volume and shifts in product mix partially offset by lower fuel surcharge rates on our air products 

operating expenses 

2019 compared to 2018 

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses increased largely due to pickup and delivery costs up 1385 billion costs of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up 631 million costs of package sorting up 301 million and other indirect operating costs up 92 million 

in order to manage costs we continually adjust our air and ground network to better match higher volume levels in addition we continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints the growth in pickup and delivery and network operational costs was impacted by several factors 

 we incurred higher employee benefit expenses due to additional headcount contractual contribution rate increases to union multiemployer plans and changes in benefit eligibility for certain union employees these increases were slightly offset by lower pension expense for our companysponsored plans due to higher discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligations which reduced service costs and lower premiums due to improved funded status 

 total cost per piece which includes transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses decreased 09 for the year excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses adjusted cost per piece decreased 08 for the year year over year cost per piece decreased due to the incremental impact of our new automated facilities and other transformation initiatives 

operating profit and margin 

2019 compared to 2018 

operating profit increased 521 million with operating margins increasing 60 basis points to 90 excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses adjusted operating profit increased 491 million with operating margins increasing 50 basis points to 94 operating profit increased as a result of the items described above

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

volume 

2019 compared to 2018 

our overall average daily volume decreased slightly due to weak demand from several sectors including high tech manufacturing professional services automotive and government partially offset by higher demand in healthcare retail and other sectors 

export volume decreased slightly in 2019 european export volume declined across all trade lanes while intraeuropean volume grew slightly total us export volume decreased with declines in the europe and asia trade lanes partially offset by growth in the us to americas and us to ismea trade lanes asia exports grew in all major trade lanes with the exception of the united states export volume for the year was strongest in our nonpremium transborder standard product offset by declines in our premium worldwide and transborder express services 

domestic volume also decreased slightly for the year as growth in several domestic markets was more than offset by challenging economic conditions particularly in the united kingdom and other european countries additionally a postal strike in canada in 2018 drove additional domestic volume which did not repeat in 2019 

rates and product mix 

2019 compared to 2018 

on december 26 2018 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market on august 26 2019 we implemented a 10 increase in international airimport fuel surcharge 

total average revenue per piece decreased in 2019 due entirely to a 170 basis point decrease from currency excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece increased 08 due to increases in base rates partially offset by declines in fuel surcharge indices 

domestic revenue per piece decreased 120 basis points driven entirely by a 390 basis point decrease from currency excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece increased 27 due to base rate increases 

export revenue per piece decreased 60 basis points also driven entirely by a 110 basis point decrease from currency excluding the impact of currency revenue per piece increased 05 as the trend toward our lower priced nonpremium services was more than offset by base rate increases 

fuel surcharges 

we apply fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services the fuel surcharge for international air products originating inside or outside the united states is largely indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipments originate 

while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of products sold the base price and any additional charges or discounts on these services 

total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 33 million in 2019 primarily due to decreases in fuel surcharge indices and decreases in volume 

operating expenses 

2019 compared to 2018 

operating expenses and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs decreased for 2019 these decreases are the results of effective management of network capacity and cost in response to lower volumes within our air ground and local pickup and delivery networks combined with lower fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

in addition to variability in usage and market prices the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm 

the cost of operating our integrated international air and ground network decreased 130 million for 2019 the decrease in network costs was primarily driven by a 21 decrease in aircraft block hours due in large part to our ability to adjust our global air network to match capacity with demand and lower package volume for the year together with lower fuel prices pickup and delivery costs decreased 105 million in 2019 the remaining decrease in operating expenses was driven by a 40 million gain from the sale of surplus property in canada as well as decreases in the costs of package sorting and other indirect operating costs 

operating profit and margin 

2019 compared to 2018 

operating profit increased 128 million for the year with operating margin increasing 120 basis points to 187 excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs adjusted operating profit increased with adjusted operating margin up 150 basis points to 195 operating profit increased as a result of the items described above

revenue 

2019 compared to 2018 

total revenue for the supply chain  freight segment decreased 445 million in 2019 compared with 2018  

forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to an overall decline in market demand that was impacted by global trade uncertainties this led to lower volume and declines in market rates in our international air and ocean freight forwarding businesses in addition excess capacity in the truckload brokerage market depressed rates contributing to the year over year decrease in revenue these decreases were partially offset by yield management initiatives in our air and ocean freight businesses 

logistics revenue increased as we experienced growth in the healthcare mail services retail and manufacturing sectors 

overall ups freight revenue increased as declines in ltl tonnage and shipment volume which were largely attributable to market demand and the residual impacts of the fourth quarter 2018 network disruption were more than offset by yield management initiatives and volume growth in our ground freight pricing product 

operating expenses 

2019 compared to 2018 

total operating expenses for the supply chain  freight segment and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs decreased in 2019 compared with 2018  

forwarding operating expenses decreased 685 million largely due to reductions in purchased transportation purchased transportation expense decreased 655 million primarily due to lower tonnage and declines in market rates in our international air and ocean freight forwarding businesses as well as a decrease in volume and market rates in truckload brokerage cost management initiatives in our freight forwarding businesses also contributed to the reduction in operating expenses 

logistics operating expenses increased 172 million primarily due to increases in purchased transportation driven by increased volume and rates particularly in our mail services business additionally business investments in healthcare quality assurance and technology increased costs 

ups freight operating expenses decreased 54 million decreases in costs associated with operating our linehaul network 49 million and decreases in pickup and delivery costs 40 million were driven by lower expenses from outside transportation carriers as a result of a decline in tonnage lower fuel surcharges and the residual impacts of the fourth quarter 2018 network disruption these decreases were offset by increases in transportation expense for our ground freight pricing product due to higher volume cost management initiatives and production improvements largely contributed to the overall reduction in operating expenses

benefits costs increased 645 million excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs adjusted benefits costs increased 762 million due to the following 

 repairs and maintenance 

2019 compared to 2018 

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was driven by maintenance of our aircraft routine repairs to buildings and facilities and maintenance of our other transportation equipment due to additional investments we have made in recent periods 

depreciation and amortization 

2019 compared to 2018 

we evaluate the useful lives of all our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets see note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of the policy 

for 2019 depreciation expense increased 365 million and net income decreased by 287 million or 033 per share on a basic and diluted basis as a result of investments in property plant and equipment net of disposals and assets becoming fully depreciated depreciation expense decreased 212 million and net income increased 167 million or 019 per share on a basic and diluted basis as a result of lengthening our estimated useful lives for various asset categories in the latter half of 2018 the combined effect of the foregoing was a net increase in depreciation expense of 153 million and a decrease in net income of 120 million or 014 per share on a basic and diluted basis for the year 

purchased transportation 

2019 compared to 2018 

the decrease in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air rail ocean and truck carriers was primarily driven by the following factors 

 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries

fuel 

2019 compared to 2018 

the decrease in fuel expense was driven by lower jet fuel diesel and gasoline prices as well as higher alternative fuel tax credits as a result of legislation passed in 2019 these decreases were partially offset by higher consumption due to additional aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven by higher us domestic package volume 

other occupancy 

2019 compared to 2018 

the increase in other occupancy expense and other occupancy expense excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs was primarily driven by additional operating facilities coming into service 

other expenses 

2019 compared to 2018 

other expenses and other expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses increased for 2019 the increase was attributable to various items including adjustments to reserves for selfinsured automobile liability claims bad debt expense technology equipment and software licenses professional service fees and advertising these increases were partially offset by a 40 million gain on the sale of surplus property in canada and lower travel and entertainment expenses

1 represents depreciation and amortization gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign exchange deferred income taxes provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable amortization on operating lease assets pension and postretirement benefit expense stock compensation expense and other noncash items 

cash from operating activities remained strong throughout 2018 and 2019 most of the variability in operating cash flows during this period related to funding companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied in accordance with minimum funding requirements we made discretionary contributions to our three primary companysponsored us pension plans totaling 20 billion in 2019 no discretionary contributions were made in 2018 the remaining contributions in 2018 and 2019 were to our international pension plans and us postretirement medical benefit plans 

operating cash flows were impacted by changes in our working capital management whereby certain payments from the fourth quarter of 2018 shifted into the first quarter of 2019 in addition accelerated growth in the business lifted overall working capital demand the net hedge margin collateral received from our derivative counterparties was 171 and 482 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively due to the change in net fair value of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs cash payments for income taxes were 514 million and 2 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively primarily due to timing of deductions related to pension contributions 

as of december 31 2019  our total worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  5741 billion  of which approximately 2564 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the us without any us federal income taxes any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and us state taxes when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 

1 in addition to capital expenditures of 6380 and 6283 billion in 2019 and 2018 respectively there were capital expenditures relating to the principal repayments of finance lease obligations of 140 and 340 million these are included in cash flows from financing activities 

we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions in 2017 we began a multiyear investment program in our smart global logistics network which impacts all asset categories with the largest investments in buildings facilities and plant equipment this investment program will continue in 2020 and we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 65 to 70 billion 

capital expenditures on buildings facilities and plant equipment decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 in our us and international package businesses as we completed several facility automation and capacity expansion projects in 2018 capital spending on aircraft increased in 2019 compared 2018 due to a net increase in contract deposits on open aircraft orders and final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft capital spending on information technology increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to continuing development of technology enabled solutions and capitalized software projects capital spending on vehicles increased in 2019 relative to 2018 largely due to the timing of vehicle replacements and expansion of the overall fleet to support volume growth 

proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely attributable to the sale of an international property in 2019 and disposal of equipment in 2018 the net change in finance receivables was due to reductions in our finance portfolios in 2019 compared with 2018 purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions in 2019 and 2018 related to our acquisition of area franchise rights for the ups store as well as other small acquisitions in our international small package and logistics business units in 2019 other investing activities are impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments and various other items

cash flows from financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we repurchased a total of 91 and 89 million shares of class a and class b common stock for  1005 and  1000 billion respectively  1004 and  1011 billion in repurchases for 2019 and 2018  respectively are reported on the cash flow statement due to the timing of settlements for additional information on our share repurchase activities see note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 dividends reported within shareowners equity include 147 and 178 million respectively of noncash dividends that were settled in shares of class a common stock 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2020 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 096 to 101 per share a 52 increase

issuances of debt in 2019 consisted of fixedrate senior notes totaling 30 billion and commercial paper in 2018 issuances of debt consisted primarily of commercial paper the following is a summary of debt issuances in 2019 in millions 

repayments of debt in 2019 and 2018 consisted primarily of our 10 billion 5125 fixedrate senior notes that matured in april 2019 and our 750 million 550 fixedrate senior notes that matured in january 2018 the remaining repayments of debt during the period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program in millions 





the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the amount of stock option exercises by employees in 2018 and 2019 

other financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares from employees sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested stock awards of 180 and 259 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively net cash inflows from premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 21 and 34 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

except as disclosed in note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations primarily through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019 in millions 



1 purchase commitments includes amounts due under aircraft leases that we entered into in 2019 and our january 29 2020 announced commitment to purchase 10000 electric vehicles 

our finance lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate finance leases and operating leases are discussed further in note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt and variable rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31 2019  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets goods or services that are legally binding including contracts for aircraft construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2019  we had firm commitments to lease three used and purchase eight new boeing 767300 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2021 and to purchase 13 new boeing 7478f aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2022 we also had a firm commitment to purchase five boeing md11 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2021 we paid the full purchase price for these md11 aircraft in december 2019 therefore these amounts are not included in the table above 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the tax act but are required under current internal revenue service guidance to offset certain overpayments of tax against the liability we made this election and have reflected our remaining transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation 

there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates other actuarial assumptions and changes to pension plan funding regulations a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in equity or bond returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2020 cannot be reasonably estimated

as discussed in note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the table above does not include approximately  228 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  1267 billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2019  we had  1327 billion of surety bonds written as of december 31 2019  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  131 million associated with ups capital 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures transformation strategy and pension contributions for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with gaap as indicated in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with gaap we base our estimates on prior experience and assumptions and thirdparty input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ materially from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and subject to various contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability this difference could be material income taxes and selfinsurance are discussed below except as disclosed in note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements other contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of or for the year ended december 31 2019  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of or for the year ended december 31 2019  because a loss was not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we test goodwill for impairment in each of our reporting units on an annual basis our us domestic package segment is a reporting unit in our international package reporting segment we have the following reporting units europe asia americas and ismea in our supply chain  freight segment we have the following reporting units forwarding logistics ups mail innovations ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july 1 st for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow “dcf” model and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures and working capital changes as well as assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we routinely monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 or 2018  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test based on most recent tests the fair value of all our reporting units exceed their carrying value

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200 million and licenses with a carrying value of  4 million as of december 31 2019 are considered to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value these assumptions include projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions 

all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations impairments of finitelived intangible assets were  2 and  12 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively there were no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets in 2019 or 2018  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automobile liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as loss estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on thirdparty actuarial estimates which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of our reserves 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in healthcare costs the results of any related litigation and with respect to workers’ compensation claims and changes in legislation furthermore claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections all of these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results based on our historical experience during 2019 we changed our selfinsurance reserves from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of losses we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations for additional information on our selfinsurance reserves refer to note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of among other things the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation we believe our estimates are reasonableappropriate actual experience may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups in october 2019 we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet by approximately 900 million as of december 31 2019 decreased the pretax marktomarket charge by approximately 810 million and increased net income by 616 million or 071 per share on a basic and diluted basis 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increasedecrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 in millions

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2019  we had  30482 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates of the expected useful lives the expected residual values and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows which they generate 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we rely upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance programs changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense in 2019 we revised our estimates of the useful lives and residual values for certain airframes engines and related rotable parts this change increased the useful lives of certain fleet types and reduced the useful lives and residual values of the majority of our used aircraft the net impact to 2019 depreciation expense was not material in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

we evaluate the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets as part of our ongoing investment in transformation in 2018 we revised our estimates of useful lives for building improvements vehicles and plant equipment based on our current assessment of these factors in general these changes in estimate had the effect of lengthening the useful lives of vehicles building improvements and plant equipment and were applied prospectively beginning in 2018 through depreciation expense see consolidated operating expenses of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the discussion of the impacts to depreciation and amortization see note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies and note 4 for a discussion of the change in estimated useful lives 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2019 or 2018  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations if listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets these assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of an impairment 

for acquisitions we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage intermodal and truckload services the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2019 and 2018  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forwards as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floatingrate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates for a discussion of the risks associated with the anticipated cessation of libor see item 1a risk factors  the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate libor could have an adverse effect on us 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2019 and 2018

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control may adversely impact our credit rating and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy in addition there remains substantial economic uncertainty arising from the united kingdom’s 2016 vote to leave the european union in 2017 the uk government initiated a process to leave the eu and the uk and the eu continue to negotiate the future relationship between the uk and the eu which could take several years to finalize the results of these negotiations could result in among other things fewer goods being transported globally volatility in currency exchange rates and further regulations relating to among other things trade and aviation any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others including start ups and other companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs competition may also come from other sources in the future including as a result of the development of new technologies some of our competitors may have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer additionally to remain competitive we may have to raise costs to our customers and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher costs if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches trends in the ecommerce industry such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally which could increase our operating costs 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges recently trade discussions between the us and some of its trading partners have been fluid and any trade agreements that may be entered into are subject to a number of uncertainties including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs the impact of new laws regulations and policies cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could materially adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we are subject to increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change and new regulations could materially increase our operating costs 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts particularly internationally but also in the united states to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions state and local governments also are increasingly considering ghg regulation the possibility of increased regulation of ghg emissions potentially exposes our transportation and logistics businesses to significant new taxes fees and other costs compliance with such potential regulation or the associated potential costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change 

for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions under this decision all of our flights operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirements and we are required annually to purchase emission allowances in an amount exceeding the number of free allowances allocated to us under the ets similarly in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

in the us congress in the past several years has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions but these bills so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency “epa” spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act could determine to regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us 

in august 2017 the us announced its intention to withdraw from the paris climate accord an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions and the effect of that withdrawal on future us policy regarding ghg emissions on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business 

we may face additional regulations regarding ghg emissions internationally and in the united states potential costs to us of increased regulation regarding ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely we cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results it is possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating expenses if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy as well as gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers social media may accelerate and amplify the scope of negative publicity and increase the challenge of responding to negative claims damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant data breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business financial results or reputation and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems including the internet to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data our franchised center locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities 

in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches became effective in may 2018 other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

our information technology systems as well as those of our franchisees and acquired businesses may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks ransomware attacks malware attacks malicious employees or other insiders telecommunications failures human errors or catastrophic events hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including our customers and franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and thirdparty delivery services these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these thirdparties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events which could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to or misuse of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems or those of acquired businesses franchisees customers service providers or other thirdparties could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for us among other consequences our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted further disrupting our operations similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation fines sanctions or other penalties 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite our best efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions for example in 2014 a broadbased malware intrusion targeting retailers throughout the us was discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately 1 of our franchisees’ locations while the impact of this cyberattack including the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities was not material to our business and our financial results there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future and our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires or earthquakes epidemics or pandemics conflicts or unrest or terrorist attacks may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in international markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments that are beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us further cost increases could materially and adversely affect us 

our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in healthcare costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations continually increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans our national master agreement with the teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not materially adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts however in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors including investment performance healthcare inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund the cspf ups was a contributing employer to the cspf until 2007 when we withdrew from the cspf and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan “upsibt plan” for ups participants whose last employer was ups and who had not retired as of january 1 2008 “the ups transfer group” in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf under our withdrawal agreement with the cspf benefits to the ups transfer group cannot be reduced without our consent and can only be reduced in accordance with applicable law 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act “mpra” this change in law for the first time permitted multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of the treasury “treasury” in may 2016 treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf in the first quarter of 2018 congress established a joint select committee to develop a recommendation to improve the solvency of multiemployer plans and the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” before a november 30 2018 deadline while the committee’s efforts failed to meet its deadline the committee made significant progress towards finding solutions that will address the long term solvency of multiemployer pension plans ups will continue to work with all stakeholders including legislators and regulators to implement an acceptable solution 

the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funded status is necessary or that it will become insolvent in 2025 and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency numerous factors could affect the cspf’s funded status and ups’s potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits under the upsibt plan any obligation to pay coordinating benefits will be subject to a number of significant uncertainties including whether the cspf submits a revised mpra filing and the terms thereof or whether it otherwise seeks federal government assistance as well as the terms of any applicable legislation the extent to which benefits are paid by the pbgc and our ability to successfully defend legal positions we may take in the future under the mpra including the suspension ordering provisions our withdrawal agreement and other applicable law 

we account for the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits to the ups transfer group under accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation retirement benefits “asc 715” which requires us to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date while we currently believe the most likely outcome to this matter and the broader systemic problems facing multiemployer pension plans is intervention by the federal government asc 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law in making a best estimate of pension liabilities 

as such our best estimate of the next most likely outcome at the measurement date is that the cspf submits and implements another benefit reduction plan under the mpra during 2019 we believe any mpra filing would be designed to forestall insolvency by reducing benefits to participants other than the ups transfer group to the maximum extent permitted and then reducing benefits to the ups transfer group by a lesser amount 

we have evaluated this outcome using a deterministic cash flow projection reflecting updated estimated cspf cash flows and investment earnings the lack of legislative action and the absence of a mpra filing by the cspf in 2018 as a result at the december 31 2018 measurement date the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation increased by 16 billion for coordinating benefits that may be required to be directly provided by the upsibt plan to the ups transfer group 

the future value of this estimate will be influenced by the terms and timing of any mpra filing changes in our discount rate rate of return on assets and other actuarial assumptions presumed solvency of the pbgc as well as potential solutions resulting from federal government intervention any such event may result in a decrease or an increase in the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation if the uncertainties are not resolved it is reasonably possible that our projected benefit obligation could increase by approximately 24 billion resulting in a total obligation for coordinating benefits of approximately 40 billion as previously disclosed if a future change in law occurs it may be a significant event requiring an interim remeasurement of the upsibt plan at the date the law is enacted we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on our projected benefit obligation in accordance with asc 715 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions many aspects of the tax act remain unclear and may not be clarified for some time in addition many state jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on the state treatment of certain aspects of the tax act as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our tax rates and our financial position 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

tableend 

overview 

during 2018 we produced strong revenue growth across all three segments we realized improvements in revenue per piece as pricing and growth initiatives drove an increase in yields in all of our major products 

we achieved solid operating profit growth in both our international package and supply chain  freight segments operating profit in our us domestic segment operation was negatively impacted primarily by planned costs related to our transformation strategy higher pension expenses one less operating day and the impact of bringing new facility and technology projects online the benefits of our efficiency and growth initiatives in the us will not be fully realized until future periods 

consolidated revenue increased 79  to 71861 billion  up from 66585 billion  in 2017 operating profit for 2018 decreased 67  to 7024 billion  which includes the impact of 360 million pretax transformation strategy costs

items affecting comparability 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including as applicable adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income expense pretax income net income and earnings per share these adjustments reflect the noncomparable items discussed below we believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying operating results and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap our nongaap financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting therefore our nongaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin other income and expense income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax effects of the transformation strategy costs and the marktomarket charges are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the adjustments the blended average of the applicable statutory tax rates in 2018  2017  and 2016  were 240 241 and 369 respectively we believe this adjusted information provides useful comparison of yeartoyear ongoing operating performance without considering the shortterm impact of transformation strategy costs we evaluate the performance of our businesses on an adjusted basis

impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we supplement the reporting of our revenue revenue per piece and operating profit along with other income and expense with similar nongaap measures that exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities we believe currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results we evaluate the performance of our international package and supply chain  freight businesses on a currencyneutral basis 

currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit the derived current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period including the period over period impact of foreign currency revenue hedging activities the difference between the current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations 

transformation strategy costs 

transformation strategy costs described in note 16  to the audited consolidated financial statements have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits other operating expenses operating profit operating margin income tax expense and effective tax rate the pretax transformation strategy costs totaled 360 million 273 million aftertax in 2018 and reflects costs and other benefits of 262 million included within compensation and benefits on the statements of consolidated income and other costs of 98 million recorded to total other expenses we believe this adjusted information provides useful comparison of yeartoyear ongoing operating performance without considering the shortterm impact of transformation strategy costs 

income tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act 

we supplement the presentation of our income tax expense and effective tax rate with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the income tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act described in the income tax expense section of managements discussion and analysis and note 13  to the audited consolidated financial statements we believe income tax expense and the effective tax rate excluding the tax benefit is useful in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current period to that of other periods presented 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charges 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost we supplement the presentation of our other income and expense with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the portion of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor and the related income tax effects 

this adjusted net periodic benefit cost 615 million in 2018 843 million in 2017 and 1074 billion in 2016 utilizes the expected return on plan assets 768 in 2018 and 865 in 2017 and 2016 the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets 238 in 2018 1425 in 2017 and 606 in 2016 and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the december 31 measurement date 445 in 2018 381 in 2017 and 434 in 2016 we believe excluding these marktomarket charges from our adjusted results provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that may provide a useful comparison of yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in other income and expense of 1627 billion 800 million and 2651 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively

volume 

2018  compared to 2017   

our overall volume increased across all products in 2018 despite one less operating day largely due to continued growth in overall retail sales of which ecommerce continues to represent a larger percentage of the total growth growth was focused within the retail healthcare and manufacturing industries 

businesstoconsumer shipments which represented more than 50 of total us domestic package volume grew 62 for the year and drove overall increases in both air and ground shipments while businesstobusiness shipments were relatively flat in 2018 compared to 2017 volume grew 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 

among our air products volume increased in 2018 for our next day air and deferred services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping including our residential next day air next day air saver and second day package products as consumers continue to demand faster and more economical delivery options this growth was slightly offset by declines in residential next day air letter next day air saver letter and second day letter volume 

the increase in ground volume in 2018 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume which benefited from continued ecommerce demand businesstobusiness ground shipments were relatively flat in 2018 compared to 2017 however they grew approximately 3 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 

2017  compared to 2016   

our overall volume increased across all products in 2017 largely due to continued growth in overall retail sales of which ecommerce continues to represent a larger percentage of the total growth businesstoconsumer shipments which represented just over 50 of total us domestic package volume grew 94 for the year which drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness shipments decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to declines in volume in professional services as a result of increased digitization and high tech industries 

among our air products volume increased in 2017 for our next day air and deferred services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping including our residential next day air next day air saver and three day select package products as consumers continue to demand faster options this growth was slightly offset by a decline in next day air letter volume largely due to declines in the professional services industry as a result of continued growth in digitization 

the increase in ground volume in 2017 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume which benefited from continued ecommerce demand businesstobusiness shipments decreased slightly due to adverse weather conditions in third quarter 2017 however this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our return shipping services 

rates and product mix 

2018  compared to 2017   

overall revenue per piece increased 40 in 2018 and was impacted by changes in base rates the implementation of new surcharges for oversized packages and other fees customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 24 2017 ups ground rates and ups air services rates increased an average net 49 effective june 4 2018 we increased the surcharge for over maximum limits oversize pallet handling and added a shipping correction audit fee effective july 8 2018 we implemented a us residential large package surcharge and an additional handling surcharge for packages exceeding 70 pounds additionally peak surcharges were in effect from october 1 2018 through december 22 2018 for us residential large packages and packages over maximum limits the charge was designed to enable ups to continue to offset some of the additional expenses incurred during significant volume surges additionally on december 5 2018 we announced an average 49 base rate increase effective december 26 2018 for ups ground and ups air services 

in the first quarter of 2017 we began our expanded saturday ground operations to several metropolitan areas in the united states as of december 31 2018 saturday service is available in approximately 6100 cities and towns in the us covering approximately 60 of the population

revenue per piece for all products was positively impacted by higher fuel surcharge rates in 2018 due to escalating fuel prices and increases in rates 

revenue per piece for our next day air services increased in 2018 compared with 2017 the increase in next day air revenue per piece was primarily due to an increase in base rates driven by pricing initiatives and an increase in average billable weight per piece which more than offset an unfavorable shift in product mix 

revenue per piece for our deferred air services increased in 2018 compared with 2017 due to an increase in base rate pricing driven by pricing initiatives and average billable weight per piece offset slightly by an unfavorable shift in product mix 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to base rate increases driven by our pricing initiatives these factors were partially offset by changes in product mix as we experienced faster volume growth in our surepost product 

2017  compared to 2016   

overall revenue per piece increased 25 in 2017 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates

in the first quarter of 2017 we began our expanded saturday ground operations to several metropolitan areas in the united states as of december 2017 saturday service was available in approximately 4700 cities and towns in the us covering approximately 50 of the population a saturday pickup stop charge went into effect on may 1 2017 and varies depending on the pickup service selected 

revenue per piece for all products was positively impacted by higher fuel surcharge rates for 2017 

revenue per piece for our next day air services decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 the decrease in next day air revenue per piece was primarily driven by a shift in product mix as our lower yielding products experienced much larger volume growth than our higher yielding products this shift was offset slightly by an increase in the average billable weight per piece 

revenue per piece of our deferred air services increased in 2017 compared with 2016 deferred revenue per piece increased primarily due to an increase in average billable weight per piece but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2017 primarily due to base rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and an increase in average billable weight per piece these factors were partially offset by changes in product mix as we experienced faster volume growth in our surepost product 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows

effective february 6 2017 the us fuel surcharge rates are reset weekly instead of monthly in addition the price indices have moved from a two month to a two week lag in order to more closely align fuel surcharge revenues with fuel expenses in june and october 2018 ground fuel surcharge rates were raised by 050 and 025 respectively for all thresholds in october 2018 domestic air fuel surcharge rates were increased by 025 for all thresholds 

while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and extra service charges we obtain for these services and the level of pricing discounts offered 

total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 632 million in 2018 as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates caused by an increase in jet and diesel fuel prices as well as an overall increase in package volume which drove increased delivery miles driven and aircraft block hours 

operating expenses 

2018  compared to 2017   

operating expenses for the segment increased 3492 billion  in 2018  compared with 2017  which included 235 million  of transformation strategy costs excluding the impact of transformation strategy costs operating expenses for the segment increased 3257 billion  in 2018  primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 1305 billion the costs of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up 1649 billion and the costs of package sorting up 639 million offset by a reduction in indirect operating costs down 336 million for the year these expenses were primarily due to higher volume increased employee compensation costs higher pension expense higher fuel prices a 62 increase in average daily block hours and expansion of our technologyenabled network 

the growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was impacted by several factors 

 total cost per piece increased 66 in 2018  compared with 2017  which includes transformation strategy costs of 235 million  the cost per piece increase was primarily impacted by the cost increases described previously the increased expenses in 2018 were also driven by costs related to the improvement of our smart global logistics network including additional aircraft leases to improve our air service reliability costs related to the implementation of saturday operations in additional markets depreciation costs due to new facilities placed in service and higher pension expense costs were also negatively impacted by rising fuel prices offset by net changes in depreciation primarily driven by changes in the useful lives of vehicles plant equipment and building improvements

operating profit and margin 

2018  compared to 2017   

operating profit was negatively impacted primarily by planned costs related to our transformation strategy higher pension expenses one less operating day and the impact of bringing new facility and technology projects online operating profit decreased 660 million in 2018  compared with 2017  with operating margins decreasing 220 basis points to 84 excluding the impact of transformation strategy costs operating profit decreased 425 million in 2018 compared to 2017 with operating margins decreasing 170 basis points while benefits from fuel fuel surcharge revenue increased at a faster pace than expense and lower net depreciation expense had a positive impact on operating profit higher purchased transportation costs due to volume growth one less operating day and an increase in pension costs driven by lower discount rates weighed on profits additionally operating profit was negatively impacted by costs related to continued investments in our smart global logistics network including implementation of saturday operations in additional markets the benefits of these projects will not be fully realized until future periods 

2017  compared to 2016   

operating profit decreased 325 million in 2017 compared with 2016 operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 106 operating profit was negatively impacted by an increase in continued investments in new buildings and new strategic investments including deployment of saturday operations there was an adverse impact from higher purchased transportation costs due to volume surges in the fourth quarter of 2017 and from fuel as expense increased at a faster pace than fuel surcharge revenue

2017  compared to 2016 

total operating expenses for the supply chain  freight segment increased 1348 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 

forwarding operating expenses increased 752 million largely due to increased purchased transportation expenses this was offset by operating efficiencies and the receipt of a 20 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of 2017 purchased transportation expense increased by 770 million compared to 2016 due to increased truckload brokerage movements and the resulting increased fuel surcharges passed to us from outside transportation providers increased tonnage and thirdparty air carrier procurement rates in our north american and international air freight forwarding businesses also contributed to increased purchased transportation expenses

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2017  compared to 2016   

the 59 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2017 was primarily due to repairs and maintenance of our transportation equipment resulting from growth in the size of our vehicle fleet and routine repairs to buildings and facilities 

depreciation and amortization 

2018  compared to 2017   

we evaluate the useful lives of all our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets refer to note 1 in our consolidated financial statements for further description of our policy 

total depreciation and amortization expense decreased 75 million in 2018 compared with 2017 the principal components of this change included 

 

combining the impact of the revisions to the estimated useful lives with the impact of the increased capital investments noted above resulted in a net decrease of 29 million to depreciation expense and an increase to net income of 23 million or 003 per share on both a basic and diluted basis in 2018 

the changes to the estimated useful lives described above are expected to decrease 2019 depreciation and amortization expense by approximately 335 million as compared to 2018 however this will be largely offset by approximately 330 million of additional depreciation expense related to the addition of numerous facility automation and capacity expansion projects which are part of our multiyear transformation strategy 

2017  compared to 2016 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 58 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following factors 1 depreciation expense on vehicles increased due to an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations 2 depreciation expense for buildings and facilities increased due to the opening of new facilities and facility automation and capacity expansion projects and 3 amortization expense of intangible assets increased in conjunction with the marken acquisition these factors were largely offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to longer lived internally developed capitalized software 

purchased transportation

results of operations 

 2017  compared to 2016 

the 1848 billion increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air rail ocean and truck carriers in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily driven by the following factors 

 

fuel 

2018  compared to 2017 

fuel expense increased 737 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase in fuel expense in 2018 was primarily due to higher jet fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline prices and higher consumption due to higher total aircraft block hours and increased domestic package delivery miles driven as a result of overall higher volume these increases were partially offset by the benefit of alternative fuel costs 

the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 572 million increase in fuel expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher jet fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline prices which increased fuel expense by 419 million additionally increased alternative fuel costs and fuel consumption increased expense by 170 million primarily due to volume increases which resulted in higher total aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery miles driven these increases were partially offset by increased fuel efficiency 

other occupancy 

2018  compared to 2017 

the 207 million increase in other occupancy expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was largely due to higher facility rent expense property tax expense and utility expenses these increases were primarily driven by an increase in the number of operating facilities compared to 2017

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 118 million increase in other occupancy expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was largely due to higher facility rent expense driven by new facilities as well as higher utilities and property taxes at our operating facilities 

other expenses 

2018  compared to 2017 

the 410 million increase in other expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in transportation equipment rental outside professional service costs security protection nonincome based state and local taxes and data processing costs additionally costs of 86 million related to our transformation strategy contributed to the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 436 million increase in other expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was caused by 1 an auto liability insurance expense increase of 75 million due to miles driven medical trend rates and severity experience trends and 2 transportation equipment rental increase of 60 million driven by growth in package volume 

the remaining 280 million increase is comprised of increases in several other expense categories including outside professional services security protection computer and plant supplies and air cargo handling partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense

interest expense 

2018  compared to 2017

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in millions 



our effective tax rate is affected by recurring factors such as statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the relative amounts of taxable income we earn in those jurisdictions it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but may not be consistent from year to year 

our effective tax rate decreased to 204  in 2018  compared with 313  in 2017  and 332  in 2016  primarily due to the effects of the aforementioned recurring factors and the following discrete tax items 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including a permanent corporate rate reduction to 21 and a transition to a territorial international system effective in 2018 the tax act includes provisions that affected 2017 including 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” that is payable over eight years 2 requiring a remeasurement of all us deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted corporate tax rate of 21 and 3 providing for additional firstyear depreciation that allows full expensing of qualified property placed into service after september 27 2017 

in late december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the related accounting under us gaap we recorded a 272 million provisional benefit inclusive of our transition tax liability the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign subsidiaries and the remeasurement of our us net deferred tax liabilities for the year ended december 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our accounting for the tax act based on the current regulatory guidance available at the end of the sab 118 measurement period and recorded no net adjustment to our provisional estimate 

the tax act also enacted provisions that took effect in 2018 including but not limited to 1 a provision that imposes us tax on certain foreign subsidiary income known as global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 2 a new deduction for foreignderived intangible income fdii 3 additional limitations on tax deductions for expenses such as interest and executive compensation and 4 a new minimum tax based on certain payments from a us company to foreign related parties known as the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat 

we included the impact of each of the newly effective tax act provisions in our computation of the 2018 income tax expense throughout 2018 the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service issued preliminary regulatory guidance clarifying certain provisions of the tax act we anticipate additional regulatory guidance and technical clarifications that could change our future income tax expense when additional guidance is issued we will recognize the related tax impact in the quarter of enactment

results of operations 

2018 discrete items 

the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the tax act which reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized an income tax benefit of 390 million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 1627 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2018 us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local and foreign taxes 

we recorded pretax transformation strategy costs of 360 million during the year ended december 31 2018 as a result we recorded an additional income tax benefit of 87 million this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2018 us federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of us state and local and foreign taxes 

the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to sharebased compensation in income tax expense resulted in a net tax benefit of 38 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 06 during the year ended december 31 2018 

other factors that impacted our 2018 effective tax rate include favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions favorable us state and local tax law changes favorable tax provisions enacted in the bipartisan budget act of 2018 and discrete tax credits associated with the filing of our 2017 us federal income tax return 

2017 discrete items 

in addition to the impact of the tax act described above the following discrete items were recorded during the year ended december 31 2017 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized an income tax benefit of 193 million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 800 million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a lower average tax rate than the 2017 us federal statutory tax rate due to future tax rate changes enacted by the tax act and differences between us and foreign statutory rates which was partially offset by the effect of us state and local taxes 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 tax law changes were enacted in certain nonus jurisdictions in which we operate as a result we recorded a decrease to our foreign net deferred tax assets of 14 million with a corresponding net increase to deferred tax expense of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard that requires the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation in income tax expense which resulted in tax benefits for the year ended december 31 2017 of 71 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 10 

2016 discrete items 

          in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized an income tax benefit of 978 million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 2651 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local taxes 

as described in the items affecting comparability section certain items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted income taxes in the discussion that follows 

our adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 213 in 2018 from 338 in 2017 primarily due to the impact of the tax act which reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 

our adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 338 in 2017 from 344 in 2016 primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments related to recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation in income tax expense

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2018  we had  5035 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we believe that our current cash position access to the commercial paper programs and longterm debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be adequate not only for operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs transformation strategy and to fund dividend payments share repurchases and longterm debt payments through the next several years we regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure including through issuances of debt to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs 

cash flows from operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout 2016 to 2018 most of the variability in operating cash flows during the 2016 to 2018 time period relates to the funding of our companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans we made no discretionary contributions to our three primary companysponsored us pension plans in 2018 however we made contributions of 7291 and 2461 billion in 2017 and 2016 respectively the remaining contributions from 2016 to 2018 were due to contributions to our international pension plans and us postretirement medical benefit plans 

apart from the transactions described above operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our hedge margin receivables and payables timing of income tax receipts and payments and improvements in our working capital position the net hedge margin collateral received paid from our derivative counterparties was 482 732 and 142 million during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively due to settlements and changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs cash payments for income taxes were 2 million 1559 billion and 2064 billion for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively primarily impacted by the timing of a 50 billion pension contribution made in december 2017 which resulted in a tax refund in 2018 and the timing of current tax deductions 

as of december 31 2018  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  5035 billion  of which approximately 2853 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the us without any us federal income taxes any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and us state taxes when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



1 in addition to capital expenditures of 6283 billion in 2018 there were capital expenditures relating to the principal repayments of capital lease obligations of 340 million these are included in cash flows from financing activities 

we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions in 2017 we began a multiyear investment program in our smart logistics network which impacts all asset categories with the largest investments in buildings facilities and plant equipment this investment program will continue in 2019 whereby we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 70 billion 

as such capital expenditures on buildings facilities and plant equipment increased in 2018 compared to prior periods in our us and international package businesses largely due to several facility automation and capacity expansion projects capital spending on aircraft also increased in 2018 compared to prior periods due to increased contract deposits on open aircraft orders and final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft capital spending on information technology increased in 2018 compared to the prior periods due to further development of technology enabled enhancements and capitalized software projects 

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to the disposal of equipment in 2018 vehicle retirements in 2017 and insurance recoveries in 2016 the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions was related to our acquisition of area franchise rights for the ups store in 2018 freightex nightline and sttas in 2017 and marken in 2016 

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and various other items

in may 2016  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  80  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2013 the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2018  we had  3339  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining 

share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions we anticipate repurchasing approximately  10  billion of shares in 2019  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2019 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 091 to 096 per share a 55 increase

 the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program amount in millions 







the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the level of stock option exercises by employees in the 2016 through 2018 period 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors primarily the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards of 259 247 and 167 million for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively net cash inflows from premium received on capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 34  million in 2018 and  54  million in both 2017 and 2016

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets goods or services that are legally binding including contracts for aircraft construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2018  we had firm commitments to purchase 19 new boeing 7478f cargo aircraft to be delivered between 2019 and 2022 and nine boeing 767 aircraft to be delivered between 2019 and 2020 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the tax act but are required under current irs guidance to offset certain overpayments of tax against the liability we intend to make this election and have reflected our remaining transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation 

there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans in 2019 these plans are discussed further in note 5  to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates and changes to pension plan funding regulations a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in the world equity or bond markets could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2019 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 6  to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the table above does not include approximately  216 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9  to the audited consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2018  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis in our us domestic package and international package reporting segments we have the following reporting units europe asia americas and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa in our supply chain  freight segment we have the following reporting units forwarding logistics ups mail innovations ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july 1 st  for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we routinely monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2018  2017  or 2016  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test based on most recent tests the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceed their carrying value

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200  million and licenses with a carrying value of  5  million as of december 31 2018  are considered to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value these assumptions include projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions 

all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations there was a  12  and  7  impairment of finitelived intangible assets in 2018  and 2017  respectively and no impairment of finitelived intangible assets in 2016  there was no impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets in 2018  2017  or 2016  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automobile liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in healthcare costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results prior to 2017 outside actuarial studies were performed semiannually and we used the studies to estimate the liability in intervening quarters beginning in 2017 outside actuarial studies are now performed quarterly as we believe this provides us with better quarterly estimates of our outstanding workers compensation liability 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual experience may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increasedecrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  in millions 



 

pension backstop 

ups was a contributing employer to the central states pension fund “cspf” until 2007 when we withdrew from the cspf and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan “upsibt plan” for ups participants whose last employer was ups and who had not retired as of january 1 2008 “the ups transfer group” in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf under our withdrawal agreement with the cspf benefits to the ups transfer group cannot be reduced without our consent and can only be reduced in accordance with applicable law 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act “mpra” this change in law for the first time permitted multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of the treasury “treasury” in may 2016 treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf in the first quarter of 2018 congress established a joint select committee to develop a recommendation to improve the solvency of multiemployer plans and the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” before a november 30 2018 deadline while the committee’s efforts failed to meet its deadline the committee made significant progress towards finding solutions that will address the long term solvency of multiemployer pension plans ups will continue to work with all stakeholders including legislators and regulators to implement an acceptable solution 

the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funded status is necessary or that it will become insolvent in 2025 and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency numerous factors could affect the cspf’s funded status and ups’s potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits under the upsibt plan any obligation to pay coordinating benefits will be subject to a number of significant uncertainties including whether the cspf submits a revised mpra filing and the terms thereof or whether it otherwise seeks federal government assistance as well as the terms of any applicable legislation the extent to which benefits are paid by the pbgc and our ability to successfully defend legal positions we may take in the future under the mpra including the suspension ordering provisions our withdrawal agreement and other applicable law 

we account for the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits to the ups transfer group under accounting standards codification topic 715  compensation retirement benefits  “asc 715” which requires us to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date while we currently believe the most likely outcome to this matter and the broader systemic problems facing multiemployer pension plans is intervention by the federal government asc 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law in making a best estimate of pension liabilities 

as such our best estimate of the next most likely outcome at the measurement date is that the cspf submits and implements another benefit reduction plan under the mpra during 2019 we believe any mpra filing would be designed to forestall insolvency by reducing benefits to participants other than the ups transfer group to the maximum extent permitted and then reducing benefits to the ups transfer group by a lesser amount 

we have evaluated this outcome using a deterministic cash flow projection reflecting updated estimated cspf cash flows and investment earnings the lack of legislative action and the absence of a mpra filing by the cspf in 2018 as a result at the december 31 2018 measurement date the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation increased by 16 billion for coordinating benefits that may be required to be directly provided by the upsibt plan to the ups transfer group 

the future value of this estimate will be influenced by the terms and timing of any mpra filing changes in our discount rate rate of return on assets and other actuarial assumptions presumed solvency of the pbgc as well as potential solutions resulting from federal government intervention any such event may result in a decrease or an increase in the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation if the uncertainties are not resolved it is reasonably possible that our projected benefit obligation could increase by approximately 24 billion resulting in a total obligation for coordinating benefits of approximately 40 billion as previously disclosed if a future change in law occurs it may be a significant event requiring an interim remeasurement of the upsibt plan at the date the law is enacted we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on our projected benefit obligation in accordance with asc 715

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2018  we had  26576 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

we evaluate the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policies and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets as part of our ongoing investment in transformation in 2018 we revised our estimates of useful lives for building improvements vehicles and plant equipment based on our current assessment of these factors in general these changes in estimate had the effect of lengthening the useful lives of vehicles building improvements and plant equipment the change in estimates for building improvements vehicles and plant equipment was applied prospectively beginning in 2018 through depreciation expense see consolidated operating expense of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the discussion of the impacts to depreciation and amortization see note 1  to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies see note 4  to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the change in estimated useful lives 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2018  2017  and 2016  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations if listed market prices and other relevant facts are not available inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets these assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of an impairment 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage intermodal and truckload services the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize indexbased pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locationalsupplier differential while many of the indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for fuel because of this our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2018  and 2017  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forwards as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floatingrate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2018  and 2017

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control may adversely impact our credit rating and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer goods being transported globally 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches trends in the ecommerce industry such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we are subject to increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change and new regulations could materially increase our operating costs 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts particularly internationally but also in the united states to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions state and local governments also are increasingly considering ghg regulation the possibility of increased regulation of ghg emissions potentially exposes our transportation and logistics businesses to significant new taxes fees and other costs compliance with such potential regulation or the associated potential costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change 

we are subject to international regulation of ghg emissions for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions under this decision all of our flights operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirements and we are required annually to purchase emission allowances in an amount exceeding the number of free allowances allocated to us under the ets similarly in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

in the us congress in the past several years has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions but these bills so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency “epa” spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act could determine to regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us 

in august 2017 the us announced its intention to withdraw from the paris climate accord an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions and the effect of that withdrawal on future us policy regarding ghg emissions on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business 

we may face additional regulations regarding ghg emissions internationally and in the united states potential costs to us of increased regulation regarding ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely however until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating expenses if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant data breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business financial results or reputation and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems including the internet to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data our franchised center locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities 

in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches becomes effective in may 2018 other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

our information technology systems as well as those of our franchisees and acquired businesses may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks ransomware attacks malware attacks malicious employees or other insiders telecommunications failures human errors or catastrophic events hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including our customers and franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and thirdparty delivery services these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these thirdparties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events which could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to or misuse of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems or those of acquired businesses franchisees customers service providers or other thirdparties could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for the company among other consequences our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted further disrupting our operations similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation fines sanctions or other penalties 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite our best efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions for example in august 2014 a broadbased malware intrusion targeting retailers throughout the us was discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately 1 of our franchisees’ locations while the impact of this cyberattack including the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities was not material to our business and our financial results there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future and our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires or earthquakes epidemics or pandemics conflicts or unrest or terrorist attacks may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in international markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments that are beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in healthcare costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations continually increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans the national master agreement with the ibt includes changes that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts except potential surcharges under the pension protection act of 2006 in the event that a plan enters critical status and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors including investment performance healthcare inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund the cspf ups was a contributing employer to the cspf until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters “ibt” ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan “upsibt plan” for ups participants whose last employer was ups and who had not retired as of january 1 2008 “the ups transfer group” in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act “mpra” which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the cspf participants including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that the cspf failed to comply with its contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefits to the ups transfer group under the terms of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may 6 2016 the us department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the mpra 

the cspf has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits although there are numerous factors that could affect the cspf’s funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent as they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefits thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the upsibt plan by approximately  4  billion the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency 

the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the upsibt plan is subject to a number of significant uncertainties including actions that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these actions include whether the cspf will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefits are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal positions as well as the effect of discount rates cspf asset returns and various other actuarial assumptions 

we account for this potential obligation under accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation retirement benefits “asc 715” under asc 715 we are required to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problems facing multiemployer pension plans is intervention by the federal government asc 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law in making a best estimate of pension liabilities our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2017 does not incorporate this solution however if a future change in law resulted in an obligation to provide coordinating benefits under the upsibt plan it may be a significant event and may require us to remeasure the plan assets and projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan at the date the law is enacted 

our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf’s solvency concerns is that the cspf will submit another benefit suspension application under the mpra to forestall insolvency without reducing benefits to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempts to reduce benefits for the ups transfer group under a mpra filing we would be in a strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefits cannot be reduced without our consent and such a reduction without first exhausting reductions to other groups in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2017 is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefits of the upsibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase as the uncertainties are resolved we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan in accordance with asc 715 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cut and jobs act the “tax act” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company the use of provisional estimates in our financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions many aspects of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

overview 

we produced solid growth and operating results in 2017 across all operating segments in 2017 consolidated revenue increased 82  to 65872 billion  up from 60906 billion  in 2016 revenue for 2017 increased in all segments and major product categories due to shipment growth yield expansion and benefits recognized from our network investments and portfolio initiatives while operating profits were positively impacted by these growth factors discussed above they were partially offset by impacts from natural disasters capacity constraints due to volume surges in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating costs associated with facility construction and the deployment of saturday operations in our us domestic package segment 

operating profit for 2017 was up 377  to 7529 billion  driven by strong performance in all segments and a 1851 billion reduction in the pension marktomarket charges 

average daily package volume increased 49  in 2017 we reported 2017 net income of 4910 billion  and diluted earnings per share of 561  compared to 2016 net income of 3431 billion  and diluted earnings per share of 387  

our consolidated results are presented in the table below

 items affecting comparability 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin income tax expense and effective tax rate these adjustments reflect the noncomparable items discussed below we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying results of operations and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap our nongaap financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting therefore our nongaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

we supplement the reporting of our revenue revenue per piece and operating profit with similar nongaap measures that exclude the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities we believe currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results we evaluate the performance of our international package and supply chain  freight businesses on a currencyneutral basis 

currencyneutral revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit the derived current period local currency revenue revenue per piece and operating profit are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period including the period over period impact of foreign currency revenue hedging activities the difference between the current period reported us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period us dollar revenue revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax effects of the marktomarket charges are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the adjustments the blended average of the applicable statutory tax rates in 2017  2016  and 2015  were 241 369 and 331 respectively

defined benefit plans marktomarket charges 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost we supplement the presentation of our operating profit and operating margin with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor and the related income tax effects 

the adjustments made to exclude these marktomarket adjustments utilize the expected return on plan assets 2956 2580 and 2567 billion for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and the discount rates used for determining net periodic benefit cost the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets 4811 billion 1846 billion and 110 million for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and the discount rates used for measuring the projected benefit obligation as summarized in the table below we believe excluding these marktomarket charges from our adjusted results provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that may provide a useful comparison of yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

in 2017  we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 800 million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 637 million international package segment 35 million and supply chain  freight segment 128 million 

in 2016  we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 2651 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 1908 billion international package segment 425 million and supply chain  freight segment 318 million 

in 2015  we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 118 million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 62 million international package segment 44 million and supply chain  freight segment 12 million 

the table below indicates the amounts associated with each component of the pretax marktomarket losses as well as the weightedaverage actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit costs for each year 



the 800 million 2651 billion and 118 million pretax marktomarket losses for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively were comprised of the following components

income tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act 

we supplement the presentation of our income tax expense and effective tax rate with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the income tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act described in the income tax expense section of managements discussion and analysis and note 13  to the audited consolidated financial statements we believe income tax expense and the effective tax rate excluding the tax benefit is useful in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current period to that of other periods presented the estimates are based on our initial analysis and interpretations of the tax act 

expense allocations 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments using activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment our allocation methodologies are refined periodically as necessary to reflect changes in our businesses there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodologies during 2017  2016  or 2015

our overall volume increased across all products in 2017 largely due to continued growth in overall retail sales of which ecommerce continues to represent a larger percentage of the total growth businesstoconsumer shipments which represented more than 50 of total us domestic package volume grew 93 for the year which drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness shipments decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to declines in volume in professional services as a result of increased digitization and high tech industries 

among our air products volume increased in 2017 for our next day air and deferred services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping including our residential next day air next day air saver and three day select package products as consumers continue to demand faster options this growth was slightly offset by a decline in next day air letter volume largely due to declines in the professional services industry as a result of continued growth in digitization 

the increase in ground volume in 2017 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume which benefited from continued ecommerce demand businesstobusiness shipments decreased slightly due to adverse weather conditions in third quarter 2017 however this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our return shipping services 

2016  compared to 2015   

our total volume increased across all products in 2016 largely due to continued growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales and the impact of one additional operating day businesstoconsumer shipments which represented more than 48 of total us domestic package volume grew nearly 9 for the year and 115 in the fourth quarter which drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness volume remained flat in 2016 due to revenue management initiatives and the overall slowing of the industrial manufacturing sector offset by increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping 

next day air volume increased 52 in 2016 due to strong growth in ecommerce we also experienced increased volume for our deferred air services in 2016 particularly for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping such as our residential second day air package and three day select products partially offset by decreases in our businesstobusiness deferred air volume 

the increase in ground volume in 2016 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume while businesstobusiness shipments remained flat accelerating growth in ecommerce drove demand for our surepost service with volume increasing 19 in 2016 

rates and product mix 

2017  compared to 2016   

overall revenue per piece increased 25 in 2017 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 26 2016 ups ground rates and ups air services rates increased an average net 49 effective january 8 2017 we changed the dimensional weight calculation for packages subject to ups daily rates on june 19 2017 we announced a new peak charge applicable during selected weeks in november and december 2017 for us residential large packages and packages over maximum limits the new charge is designed to enable ups to continue to offset some of the additional expenses incurred during significant volume surges additionally on october 25 2017 we announced an average 49 base rate increase effective december 24 2017 for ups ground and ups air services 

in the first quarter of 2017 we began our expanded saturday ground operations to several metropolitan areas in the us as of december 2017 saturday service is available in approximately 4700 cities and towns in the us covering approximately 50 of the population a saturday pickup stop charge went into effect on may 1 2017 and varies depending on the pickup service selected

results of operations 

revenue per piece for our next day air services decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 the decrease in next day air revenue per piece was primarily driven by a shift in product mix as our lower yielding products experienced much larger volume growth than our higher yielding products this shift was offset slightly by an increase in the average billable weight per piece revenue per piece of our deferred air services increased in 2017 compared with 2016 deferred revenue per piece increased primarily due to an increase in average billable weight per piece but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix all products were positively impacted by higher fuel surcharge rates for 2017 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2017 primarily due to base rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and an increase in average billable weight per piece these factors were partially offset by changes in product mix as we experienced faster volume growth in our surepost product 

2016  compared to 2015   

overall revenue per piece decreased 03 in 2016 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

ground revenue per piece decreased in 2016 primarily due to customer and product mix changes which adversely impacted revenue per piece as a greater portion of volume in 2016 relative to 2015 came from residential customers and lighterweight shipments as surepost volume surged additionally lower fuel surcharge rates contributed to the decline these drivers more than offset the rate actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2015 

revenue per piece for next day air products declined in 2016 while our deferred air products increased all products were negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates the next day air revenue per piece decline was caused by a shift in customer and product mix as well as an increase in lighterweight packages we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments particularly our next day air saver product which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted next day air revenue per piece due to faster volume growth among our larger customers which have a lower average yield than our small and middlemarket customers deferred revenue per piece increased primarily due to heavierweight packages partially offset by product mix 

revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 28 2015 ups ground rates and accessorial charges increased an average net 49 while ups air services and accessorial charges increased an average net 52 the surcharge increased for over maximum packages and the index tables for the ground and air fuel surcharges were adjusted effective november 2 2015 a charge for ups’s thirdparty billing service was implemented effective january 4 2016 additionally the dimensions of ground packages incurring the ups additional handling charge were changed effective june 6 2016 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



effective february 6 2017 the us fuel surcharge rates are reset weekly instead of monthly in addition the price indices have moved from a two month to a two week lag 

total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 347 million in 2017 as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates caused by an increase in jet and diesel fuel prices as well as an overall increase in package volume in addition to the factors above fuel surcharge revenue was positively impacted by changes to the fuel surcharge calculation as rates and price indices are updated more frequently to better align with prevailing market rates in 2016 total fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 219 million as a result of lower fuel surcharge rates caused by declining jet and diesel fuel prices partially offset by the overall increase in package volume for the period

operating expenses 

2017  compared to 2016   

operating expenses for the period increased 12 billion which included a 13 billion decrease in marktomarket pension charges excluding the impact of the defined benefit plan marktomarket charges adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 25 billion in 2017 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 10 billion the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up 922 million the costs of package sorting up 246 million and accessorials and indirect operating costs up 279 million these increases were driven primarily by overall volume growth in 2017 adjusted operating expenses were impacted by several factors 

 total cost per piece decreased 03 in 2017 compared to 2016 and was primarily impacted by a 380 basis point decrease due to the defined benefit plan marktomarket charge offset by the cost increases described previously the increased expenses in 2017 were also driven by capacity constraints due to volume surges in the fourth quarter of 2017 startup costs of several investments underway to further expand and modernize our air and ground networks and the costs of implementing saturday operations costs were further impacted by rising fuel prices in order to contain costs we continually adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels in addition we continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity 

2016  compared to 2015   

operating expenses for the period increased 33 billion which included a 18 billion increase in marktomarket pension charges excluding the impact of the defined benefit plan marktomarket charges adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 15 billion in 2016 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 814 million the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground transportation network up 282 million the costs of package sorting up 181 million and accessorials and indirect operating costs up 180 million adjusted operating expenses were impacted by several factors 

 total cost per piece increased 55 in 2016 compared to 2015 and was primarily impacted by a 540 basis point increase due to the defined benefit plan marktomarket charge and the cost increases described previously these increases were partially offset by the continued deployment of orion which has contained the growth of average daily vehicle miles driven and the increased redirect of surepost volume to optimize delivery density on ups vehicles which has reduced the delivery costs for businesstoconsumer shipments

fuel 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 572 million increase in fuel expense in 2017 was primarily due to higher jet fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline prices which increased fuel expense by 419 million additionally increased alternative fuel costs and fuel consumption increased expense by 170 million primarily due to volume increases which resulted in higher total aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery miles driven these increases were partially offset by increased fuel efficiency 

2016  compared to 2015 

the 364 million decrease in fuel expense in 2016 was primarily due to lower jet fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline prices which decreased fuel expense by 461 million the lower fuel prices were partially offset by increased fuel consumption primarily due to increases in total aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery stops due to higher volume which increased expense by 97 million and lower alternative fuel and tax credits 

other occupancy 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 118 million increase in other occupancy expense in 2017 was largely due to higher facility rent expense driven by new facilities higher utilities and property taxes at our operating facilities 

2016  compared to 2015 

the 15 million increase in other occupancy expense in 2016 was largely due to higher facility rent expense partially offset by lower utilities and snow removal costs at our operating facilities 

other expenses 

2017  compared to 2016 

the 416 million increase in other expenses in 2017 was caused by a number of factors 

 the remaining 280 million increase is comprised of increases in several other expense categories including outside professional services merchandise protection computer and plant supplies and air cargo handling partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense 

2016  compared to 2015 

the 13 million decrease in other expenses in 2016 was largely due to a decrease in overall auto liability insurance offset by an increase in outside professional services

investment income and other 

2017  compared to 2016 

the growth in investment income and other in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher interest income from invested assets and the continued decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2016  compared to 2015 

the growth in investment income and other in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships higher interest income and unrealized gains on investments and a benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions 



our effective tax rate is affected by recurring factors such as statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions we operate in and the relative amounts of taxable income we earn in those jurisdictions it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but may not be consistent from year to year 

our effective tax rate decreased to 313  in 2017  compared with 332  in 2016  and 340 in 2015 primarily due to the effects of the following discrete tax items and recurring factors 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including a permanent corporate rate reduction to 21 and a transition to a territorial international system effective in 2018 going forward we expect a lower future effective tax rate than we have reported in recent years applying the lower corporate tax rate will lower our overall income tax expense which will impact net income and cash flows benefits from the lower tax rate will allow us to fund strategic initiatives for our customers employees and shareowners the tax act also includes provisions that affect 2017 including 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries “transition tax” that is payable over eight years 2 requiring a remeasurement of all us deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted corporate tax rate of 21 and 3 providing for additional firstyear depreciation that allows full expensing of qualified property placed into service after september 27 2017 

in late december 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the related accounting under us gaap if a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements accordingly we have recorded provisional estimates related to our transition tax liability our change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign subsidiaries and the remeasurement of our us net deferred tax liabilities 

to calculate the amount of the transition tax we must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits “ep” of the foreign subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional liability of 310 million however there are certain factors that could impact our provisional estimate 

first several of our foreign subsidiaries have a fiscal yearend and ep for these subsidiaries cannot be precisely calculated until their fiscal years conclude during 2018 second we continue to gather additional information needed to precisely estimate the impact of the transition tax on our us state and local tax liabilities given the complexity of the relevant state laws finally we expect additional regulatory guidance and technical clarifications from the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service within the next 12 months that could change our provisional estimate of the transition tax

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

as the us has moved to a territorial system we have also changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as a result we have recorded a provisional deferred tax liability and corresponding increase to deferred tax expense of 24 million there are certain factors discussed above with regard to the transition tax which could also impact our provisional estimate for the change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for all other foreign subsidiaries we continue to assert that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested we will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion for all foreign subsidiaries in light of the tax act and our provisional estimate is subject to change 

for our net us deferred tax liabilities we have recorded a provisional decrease of 606 million with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax expense of 606 million for the year ended december 31 2017 while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the corporate rate it may be affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to completing the analysis of our 2017 capital expenditures that qualify for full expensing and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences 

other 2017 discrete items 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized an income tax benefit of 193 million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 800 million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a lower average statutory tax rate than the 2017 us federal statutory tax rate due to future tax rate changes enacted by the tax act and differences between us and foreign statutory rates which was partially offset by the effect of us state and local taxes 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 tax law changes were enacted in certain nonus jurisdictions in which we operate as a result we have recorded a decrease to our foreign net deferred tax assets of 14 million with a corresponding net increase to deferred tax expense of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard that requires the recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation in income tax expense which resulted in tax benefits for the year ended december 31 2017 of 71 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 10 

2016 discrete items 

          in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized an income tax benefit of 978  million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 2651000000000  billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average statutory tax rate than the us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local taxes 

2015 discrete items 

during the third quarter of 2015 and after the filing of our annual federal tax returns we reconciled our deferred tax balances and identified adjustments to be made with respect to prior years’ deferred tax balances the adjustments resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of  66  million 

in connection with our acquisition of coyote logistics in 2015 we distributed  500  million of cash held by a canadian subsidiary to its us parent during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the distribution we recorded additional net income tax expense of  28  million 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized an income tax benefit of  39  million related to pretax marktomarket losses of  118  million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a lower average statutory tax rate than our us federal statutory tax rate because it was due in part to nonus benefit plans 

other favorable rate impacting items in 2015 include resolution of several us state and local tax matters the extension of favorable us federal tax provisions associated with the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 related to research and development tax credits and work opportunity tax credits and the execution of two bilateral advance pricing agreements these agreements established intercompany transfer pricing arrangements between the us and certain nonus jurisdictions related to our small package operations for tax years 2010 through 2019

as described in the items affecting comparability  section certain items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted income taxes in the discussion that follows 

our adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 338 in 2017 from 345 in 2016 primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments related to recognition of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation in income tax expense 

our adjusted effective tax rate increased to 345 in 2016 from 340 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in favorable discrete tax adjustments relative to 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2017  we had  4069 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we believe that our current cash position access to the longterm debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be adequate not only for operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and to fund dividend payments share repurchases and longterm debt payments through the next several years in addition we have funds available from our commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing we regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure including through issuances of debt to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs 

cash flows from operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout 2015 to 2017 most of the variability in operating cash flows during the 2015 to 2017 time period relates to the funding of our companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 apart from the transactions described above operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our working capital position payments for income taxes and changes in hedge margin payables and receivables cash payments for income taxes were 1559  2064  and 1913  billion for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and were primarily impacted by the timing of current tax deductions the net hedge margin collateral paidreceived from derivative counterparties was 732 142 and 170 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively due to settlements and changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs 

as of december 31 2017  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  4069 billion  of which approximately 1800 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners as a result of the tax act all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the us without any us federal income taxes any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and us state taxes when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2018 will be approximately 65 to 70 billion 

capital expenditures on buildings facilities and plant equipment increased in 2017 compared to the 2015 to 2016 periods in our us and international package businesses largely due to several facility automation and capacity expansion projects capital spending on aircraft increased in 2017 compared to the 2015 to 2016 periods due to contract deposits on open aircraft orders and final payments for new boeing 7478f cargo aircraft and previously owned boeing 767300 cargo aircraft capital spending on vehicles increased in 2017 in our us and international package businesses largely due to growth in our business and the timing of vehicle replacements capital spending on information technology increased in 2017 compared to the 2015 to 2016 periods due to further development of our smart logistics network technology enhancements and capitalized software projects 

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment in the 2015 to 2017 periods were largely due to vehicle retirements in 2017 insurance recoveries in 2016 and real estate sales in 2015 the net decline in finance receivables in 2017 was primarily due to growth in our cargo finance products partially offset by loan principal paydowns in our business credit portfolio the net change in finance receivables in the 2016 and 2015 periods was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2015 to 2017 periods was primarily related to the acquisitions of poltraf sp zoo parcel pro inc and coyote in 2015 marken in 2016 and freightex nightline and sttas in 2017 

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments and restricted cash balances capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and various other items in 2017 2016 and 2015 we increased the noncurrent investments and restricted cash balance associated with our selfinsurance requirements by  4  3 and 0 million respectively

cash flows from financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



 for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we repurchased a total of 161  252  and 268 million shares of class a and class b common stock for  1816   2680  and  2711  billion respectively  1813   2678  and  2702  billion in repurchases for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively are reported on the cash flow statement due to the timing of settlements during the first quarter of 2016 we also exercised a capped call option that we entered in 2015 for which we received 02  million ups class b shares the 25  million premium payment for this capped call option reduced shareowners equity in 2015 

in may 2016  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  80  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2013 the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2017  we had  4339  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining 

share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program we anticipate repurchasing approximately  10  billion of shares in 2018  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 083 to  091  per share a 10 increase

        the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program amount in millions 







the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the level of stock option exercises by employees in the 2015 through 2017 period 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors primarily the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards of 247 167 and 217 million for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net cash inflows outflows from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 54 million in both 2017 and 2016 and 17 million for 2015

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  in millions 



1 purchase commitments include our announcement on february 1 2018 for 14 new boeing 7478 freighters and four new boeing 767 aircraft 

our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8  to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2017  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets goods or services that are legally binding including contracts for aircraft construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2017  we had firm commitments to purchase 14 new boeing 7478f cargo aircraft the 14 aircraft are to be delivered between 2017 and 2020 on february 1 2018 we announced an order for 14 additional boeing 7478 freighters previously under option and four new boeing 767 aircraft to be delivered between 2019 and 2022 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted into law the tax act requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the tax act we intend to make this election and have reflected our estimated transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation 

there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 4  to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates and changes to pension plan funding regulations a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in the world equity or bond markets could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2020 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 5  to the audited consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 

the table above does not include approximately  212 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  1084  billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2017  we had  932  million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2017  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  137  million associated with ups capital 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2017  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2017  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis in our us domestic package and international package reporting segments we have the following reporting units europe asia americas and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa in our supply chain  freight segment we have the following reporting units forwarding logistics ups mail innovations ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics during the third quarter of 2017 we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment testing from october 1st to july 1st this change better aligns the timing of the goodwill impairment test with our longterm business planning process the change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july 1 st  for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we routinely monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2017  2016  or 2015  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test based on most recent tests the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceed their carrying value 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200  million and licenses with a carrying value of  5  million as of december 31 2017  are considered to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value these assumptions include projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions 

all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations there were no impairments of any indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets in 2017  2016  or 2015  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in healthcare costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results prior to 2017 outside actuarial studies were performed semiannually and we used the studies to estimate the liability in intervening quarters beginning in 2017 outside actuarial studies are now performed quarterly as we believe this provides us with better quarterly estimates of our outstanding workers compensation liability 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual experience may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate return on assets and healthcare cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2017  in millions

pension backstop 

ups was a contributing employer to the central states pension fund cspf until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan upsibt plan for ups participants whose last employer was ups and who had not retired as of january 1 2008 the ups transfer group in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the cspf participants including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and the cspf failed to comply with its contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefits to the ups transfer group under the terms of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may 6 2016 the us department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the mpra 

the cspf has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits although there are numerous factors that could affect the cspfs funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent as they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefits thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the upsibt plan by approximately  4  billion the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency 

the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the upsibt plan is subject to a number of significant uncertainties including actions that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these actions include whether the cspf will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefits are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal positions as well as the effect of discount rates cspf asset returns and various other actuarial assumptions 

we account for this potential obligation under accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation retirement benefits “asc 715” under asc 715 we are required to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problems facing multiemployer pension plans is intervention by the federal government asc 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law in making a best estimate of pension liabilities our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2017 does not incorporate this solution however if a future change in law resulted in an obligation to provide coordinating benefits under the upsibt plan it may be a significant event and may require us to remeasure the plan assets and projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan at the date the law is enacted 

our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf’s solvency concerns is that the cspf will submit another benefit suspension application under the mpra to forestall insolvency without reducing benefits to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempts to reduce benefits for the ups transfer group under a mpra filing we would be in a strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefits cannot be reduced without our consent and such a reduction without first exhausting reductions to other groups in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2017 is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefits of the upsibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase as the uncertainties are resolved we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan in accordance with asc 715

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2017  we had  22118 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2017  2016  and 2015  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage intermodal and truckload services additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2017  and 2016  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forwards as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floatingrate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2017  and 2016

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer goods being transported globally 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches trends in the ecommerce industry such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such a potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our franchised center locations also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities our information technology systems as well as those of our franchisees some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers malicious insiders telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events hackers acting individually or in coordinated groups may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant in august 2014 a broadbased malware intrusion targeting retailers throughout the us was discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately 1 of our franchisees’ locations while the impact of this cyberattack including the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities was not material to our business and our financial results our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate any future breaches may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires or earthquakes epidemics or pandemics conflicts or unrest or terrorist attacks may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in international markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations continually increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans the new national master agreement with the ibt includes changes that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts except potential surcharges under the pension protection act of 2006 in the event that a plan enters critical status and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors including investment performance health care inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund the cspf ups was a contributing employer to the cspf until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan “upsibt plan” for ups participants retiring on or after january 1 2008 in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act “mpra” which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government oversight in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the cspf participants including ups participants retiring on or after january 1 2008 we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that certain actions by the cspf were invalid on may 6 2016 the us department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the mpra 

the cspf has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits although there are numerous factors that could affect the cspf’s status if the cspf were to become insolvent as they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefits thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the upsibt plan by approximately 4 billion the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency 

the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the upsibt plan is subject to a number of uncertainties including actions that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these actions include whether the cspf will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefits are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation as well as the effect of discount rates and various other actuarial assumptions our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2016 is that we do not have any liability for additional coordinating benefits of the upsibt plan however there are numerous uncertainties that exist regarding the ultimate resolution of the cspf situation and the current projected benefit obligation could materially increase as these uncertainties are resolved    we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 715  compensation  retirement benefits 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

the us economic environment was mixed in 2016 as relatively stable consumer conditions were somewhat offset by continued weakness in industrial production and soft business investment us manufacturing has shown positive signs of growth in recent months reaching a twoyear high in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we continue to see modest gdp growth consumer confidence reached a high in the fourth quarter of 2016 and there were lower fuel prices coupled with the continuation of steady job growth throughout the year holiday retail sales grew 4 in 2016 as compared to last year mainly driven by online sales while the holiday season saw many categories of traditional brick and mortar stores struggle continued growth in ecommerce and omnichannel retail sales has driven package volume demand for residential products given these trends our products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipments have experienced the strongest growth 

outside the us emerging markets have stabilized in recent months and most developed nations have seen modest growth the impending exit of the united kingdom from the european union creates some uncertainty regarding its impact on global gdp the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide and fluctuations in currency markets particularly the strengthening of the us dollar have continued shifting trade patterns and weakened demand in certain trade lanes as a result of these circumstances we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume levels our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 

while the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in 2016 we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the us and internationally to 1 improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network 2 improve yield management and 3 increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments most notably the continued deployment of technology improvements including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on road integrated optimization and navigation system  orion should continue to increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency flexibility and reliability additionally we have continued to utilize newly expanded operating facilities to improve timeintransit for shipments in each region 

our consolidated results are presented in the table below

results of operations 

items affecting comparability 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin income tax expense and effective tax rate these adjustments reflect the noncomparable items discussed below we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our underlying operations results and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted compensation and benefits operating expenses operating profit operating margin income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows the income tax effects of these adjustments are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction including the us federal jurisdiction and various us state and nonus jurisdictions by the adjustments the blended average of the applicable statutory tax rates in 2016 2015 and 2014 were 369  331 and 372 respectively 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charges 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost we supplement the presentation of our operating profit and operating margin with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor and the related income tax effects 

the adjustments made to exclude these marktomarket adjustments utilize the expected return on plan assets 2580 billion 2567 billion and 2343 billion for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and the discount rates used for determining net periodic benefit cost the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets 1846 billion 110 million and 2600 billion for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and the discount rates used for measuring the projected benefit obligation as summarized in the table below we believe excluding these marktomarket charges from our adjusted results provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that may provide a useful comparison of yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

in 2016 we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 2651 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 1908 billion international package segment 425 million and supply chain  freight segment 318 million 

in 2015 we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 118 million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 62 million international package segment 44 million and supply chain  freight segment 12 million

in 2014 we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 1062 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 660 million international package segment 200 million and supply chain  freight segment 202 million

 health and welfare plan charges 

in connection with the ratification of our national master agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters in 2014 we incurred pretax charges totaling 1102 billion associated with changes in the delivery of healthcare benefits to certain active and retired union employees these onetime charges are discussed in further detail in the collective bargaining agreements section and do not reflect the obligations of our ongoing business we believe adjusting for these charges provides important supplemental information that is reflective of longterm trends and that may provide useful comparison of yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of onetime health and welfare plan charges 

 these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 990 million international package segment 28 million and supply chain  freight segment 84 million 

rate adjustments 

effective february 6 2017 the us fuel surcharge will be adjusted weekly and the us import fuel surcharge percentage will increase and be assessed independently of the us air and export fuel surcharge 

effective january 8 2017 the additional handling charge will be assessed for any package with the longest side exceeding 48 inches instead of 60 inches additionally we will change the dimensional weight calculation for us domestic services and ups standard from canada import packages subject to ups daily rates also transactional requests for refunds under the ups service guarantee will not be paid where timely upload of packagelevel detail is not provided as set forth in the ups tariffterms and conditions of service 

effective december 26 2016 ups ground rates and accessorial charges increased by an average net 49 ups air and international services and accessorials including ups air freight rates within and between the us canada and puerto rico increased an average net 49 ups freights densitybased rate tariff will increase an average net of 49 

these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

expense allocations 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2016  2015  or 2014

results of operations 

volume 

2016  compared to 2015   

our total volume increased across all products in 2016 largely due to continued growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales and the impact of one additional operating day businesstoconsumer shipments which represented more than 48 of total us domestic package volume grew nearly 9 for the year and 115 in the fourth quarter which drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness volume remained flat in 2016 due to revenue management initiatives and the overall slowing of the industrial manufacturing sector offset by increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping 

next day air volume increased 52 in 2016 due to strong growth in ecommerce we also experienced increased volume for our deferred air services in 2016 particularly for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping such as our residential second day air package and three day select products partially offset by decreases in our businesstobusiness deferred air volume 

the increase in ground volume in 2016 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume while businesstobusiness shipments remained flat accelerating growth in ecommerce drove demand for our surepost service with volume increasing 19 in 2016 

2015  compared to 2014   

our total volume increased in 2015 largely due to faster growing premium air products continued growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales and the impact of one additional operating day businesstoconsumer shipments which represented more than 45 of total us domestic package volume grew nearly 3 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness volume grew 1 in 2015 largely due to increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping 

among our air products we experienced increased volume for our deferred air services in 2015 particularly for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping such as our residential second day air package and three day select products we also experienced solid growth in our businesstobusiness deferred air volume largely due to increases in the retail sector next day air volume increased 33 in 2015 due to strong growth in ecommerce 

the increase in ground volume in 2015 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume and businesstobusiness shipping activity the continued growth in ecommerce drove demand for our surepost service with volume increasing 3 in 2015 the increase in businesstobusiness ground volume was largely due to growth in omnichannel retail volume the increased use of our returns service offerings and the growth in shipments from the retail sector 

rates and product mix 

2016  compared to 2015   

overall revenue per piece decreased 03 in 2016 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

ground revenue per piece decreased in 2016 primarily due to customer and product mix changes which adversely impacted revenue per piece as a greater portion of volume in 2016 relative to 2015 came from residential customers and lighterweight shipments as surepost volume surged additionally lower fuel surcharge rates contributed to the decline these drivers more than offset the rate actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2015 

revenue per piece for next day air products declined in 2016 while our deferred air products increased all products were negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates the next day air revenue per piece decline was caused by a shift in customer and product mix as well as an increase in lighterweight packages we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments particularly our next day air saver product which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted next day air revenue per piece due to faster volume growth among our larger customers which have a lower average yield than our small and middlemarket customers deferred revenue per piece increased primarily due to heavierweight packages partially offset by product mix 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 28 2015 ups ground rates and accessorial charges increased an average net 49 while ups air services and accessorial charges increased an average net 52 the surcharge increased for over maximum packages and the index tables for the ground and air fuel surcharges were adjusted effective november 2 2015 a charge for ups’s thirdparty billing service was implemented effective january 4 2016 additionally the dimensions of ground packages incurring the ups additional handling charge were changed effective june 6 2016 

2015  compared to 2014   

overall revenue per piece increased 03 in 2015 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates which took effect on december 29 2014 and an increase in surcharge rates that took effect november 2 2015 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates on ups next day air ups 2nd day air ups 3 day select and ups ground additionally a pricing change involving the application of dimensional weight pricing to all ups ground services took effect on december 29 2014 on november 2 2015 the surcharge increased for over maximum packages and the indices for ground air and international fuel surcharges were adjusted 

revenue per piece decreased for our next day air and deferred air products in 2015 as lower fuel surcharge rates more than offset the positive impact of the base rate increase product mix adversely impacted next day air and deferred revenue per piece as we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted next day air and deferred revenue per piece due to faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our small and middlemarket customers 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2015 primarily due to the base rate increase the dimensional weight pricing change and product mix additionally the revenue per piece for our traditional ground residential products was positively impacted by our decision not to pursue certain loweryielding customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by declines in fuel surcharge rates as well as changes in customer mix as we experienced faster volume growth among our larger customers 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 219 million in 2016 as a result of lower fuel surcharge rates caused by declining jet and diesel fuel prices partially offset by the overall increase in package volume for the period in 2015 total fuel surcharge revenue declined by 843 million as a result of lower fuel surcharge rates caused by declining jet and diesel fuel prices however the impact of lower fuel prices was partially mitigated by changes to the fuel surcharge indices as well as the overall increase in package volume for the period

operating expenses for the period increased 33 billion which included a 18 billion increase increase in marktomarket pension charges excluding the impact of the defined benefit plan marktomarket charges adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 15 billion in 2016 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 814 million the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground transportation network up 282 million the costs of package sorting up 181 million and accessorials and indirect operating costs up 180 million adjusted operating expenses were impacted by several factors 

 total cost per piece increased 55 in 2016 compared to 2015 and was primarily impacted by a 540 basis point increase due to the defined benefit plan marktomarket charge and the cost increases described previously these increases were partially offset by the continued deployment of orion which has contained the growth of average daily vehicle miles driven and the increased redirect of surepost volume to optimize delivery density on ups vehicles which has reduced the delivery costs for businesstoconsumer shipments 

2015  compared to 2014   

operating expenses decreased 1 billion in 2015 primarily due to 16 billion of health and welfare plan charges in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 and significantly less pension marktomarket charges in 2015 compared to 2014 excluding the impact of the health and welfare plan charges and pension marktomarket charges adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 576 million in 2015 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 602 million the costs of package sorting up 172 million and indirect operating costs up 122 million the cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground transportation network down 319 million these costs were impacted by several factors 

 total cost per piece decreased 52 in 2015 compared to 2014 and was primarily impacted by a 480 basis point decrease due to the defined benefit plan marktomarket charge and the cost increases described previously productivity improvements have continued to be realized through adjusting our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and utilizing technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency the continued deployment of orion has contained the average daily vehicle miles driven down 04 even as package volume increased up 18

operating profit and margin 

2016  compared to 2015   

operating profit decreased 18 billion in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to a 18 billion increase in marktomarket pension charges to operating expense operating margin decreased 510 basis points to 79 adjusted operating profit increased 96 million in 2016 compared with 2015 while the adjusted operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 129 revenue growth from increased volume and enhanced productivity through the continued deployment of orion technology resulted in higher operating profit but was offset by an unfavorable shift in customer and product mix especially in the fourth quarter the net impact of fuel also negatively impacted operating profit as fuel surcharge revenue decreased faster than fuel expense 

2015  compared to 2014   

operating profit increased 19 billion in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to 16 billion of health and welfare plan charges and pension marktomarket charges that were significantly less in 2015 operating margin increased 500 basis points to 130 adjusted operating profit increased 320 million in 2015 compared with 2014 while the adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 131 overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network leading to improved productivity resulting in a lower cost per piece discussed previously this was slightly offset by higher pension and healthcare costs contractual union wage increases and the negative impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue decreased faster than fuel expense

volume 

2016  compared to 2015   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2016 largely due to continued strength in businesstoconsumer volume as well as strong demand from several sectors including retail industrial hightech and healthcare 

we continued to experience export volume growth in 2016 the growth was mainly driven by our european and asian operations which experienced increases in volume to all regions of the world european export volume increased in 2016 with particular strength in the europetous and intraeurope  trade lanes asia export volume also increased in 2016 with growth in all trade lanes however us export volume declined largely due to the impact of the stronger us dollar export volume growth was distributed across all products led by our worldwide express product 

the increase in domestic volume in 2016 was primarily due to growth in italy france turkey and mexico 

2015  compared to 2014   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2015 largely due to continued strength in businesstoconsumer volume as well as strong demand from several sectors including healthcare and diversified vehicles and parts 

we continued to experience solid export volume growth in 2015 the growth was mainly driven by our european and americas operations which experienced solid increases in volume to most regions of the world european export volume increased in 2015 with particular strength in the europetous intraeuropean and europetoamericas trade lanes americas export volume increased in 2015 with solid growth in the americastoeurope and americastous trade lanes however asian export volume declined across all trade lanes due to the economic slowdown throughout the region particularly china while us export volume declined largely due to the impact of the stronger us dollar export volume growth was led by our transborder products such as transborder standard and transborder express 

domestic volume in 2015 decreased slightly from 2014 driven by selective revenue management initiatives focused on disciplined growth additionally the results were impacted by slowing overall economic conditions in germany and canada 

rates and product mix 

2016  compared to 2015 

total average revenue per piece decreased 20 in 2016 impacted by a 110 basis point reduction from currency as well as lower fuel surcharge rates these factors were partially offset by an increase in base rates lower discounts and a shift in product mix as the growth in premium products continued to exceed the growth in our standard products

fuel surcharges 

we maintain fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services the fuel surcharges for international air products originating inside or outside the united states are indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place 

total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 119 million in 2016 primarily due to price reductions in the fuel surcharge indices however this was partially offset by an increase in volume and changes in mix total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 516 million in 2015 primarily due to lower fuel prices however this was partially offset by an increase in volume and pricing changes made to the fuel surcharge indices

2016  compared to 2015 

overall operating expenses increased by 294 million which included a 381 million increase in marktomarket pension charges excluding the impact of the defined benefit plan marktomarket charges adjusted operating expenses for the segment decreased 87 million in 2016 primarily due to currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense 

operating expenses were impacted by changes in the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which decreased 40 million as well as pickup and delivery costs which decreased 143 million the decreases in network and pickup and delivery costs were largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense network cost reductions were somewhat offset by an increase in aircraft block hours up 12 in 2016 driven by a 51 increase in international export volume and continuing air product service enhancements 

operating expenses were also impacted in 2016 by a 96 million increase in indirect overhead package sorting costs and other gains and lossesthe total cost per piece for the segment decreased 18 in 2016

2015  compared to 2014   

the 29 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in airframe and aircraft engine repair and component replacement costs largely in our boeing 747 and 767 aircraft fleets the remaining increase was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations primarily due to the growth in the size of our vehicle fleet 

depreciation and amortization 

2016  compared to 2015   

depreciation and amortization expense increased 140 million in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the following factors 1 depreciation expense for buildings and facilities increased due to leasehold improvements and purchases of new equipment 2 increase in amortization expense largely due to new internally developed capitalized software as well as intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and 3 depreciation expense on vehicles increased due to the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations

2016  compared to 2015 

the 364 million decrease in fuel expense in 2016 was primarily due to lower jet fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline prices which decreased fuel expense by 461 million the lower fuel prices were partially offset by increased fuel consumption primarily due to increases in total aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery stops due to higher volume which increased expense by 97 million and lower alternative fuel and tax credits 

2015  compared to 2014 

the 1401 billion decrease in fuel expense in 2015 was primarily due to lower fuel prices which decreased fuel expense by 1383 billion increases in fuel efficiency fuel hedging activities alternative fuel credits and fewer miles driven by ups freight and international package decreased expense by 99 million these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 82 million related to increases in aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery stops and miles driven due to higher volume

investment income and other 

2016  compared to 2015 

the growth in investment income and other in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships higher interest income and unrealized gains on investments and a benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2015  compared to 2014 

the decrease in investment income was primarily due to lower realized gains on the sale of investments in 2015 compared with 2014 and a decline in interest income this was partially offset by a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships 

interest expense

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions 



our effective tax rate is affected by recurring factors such as statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions we operate in and the relative amounts of taxable income we earn in those jurisdictions it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but may not be consistent from year to year 

our effective tax rate decreased to 332  in 2016  compared with 340  in 2015  and 346 in 2014 primarily due to the effects of the following discrete tax items and recurring factors 

2016 discrete items 

          in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized an income tax benefit of 978  million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 2651  billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average statutory tax rate than the us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local taxes 

2015 discrete items 

during the third quarter of 2015 and after the filing of our annual federal tax returns we reconciled our deferred tax balances and identified adjustments to be made with respect to prior years’ deferred tax balances the adjustments resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of  66  million 

in connection with our acquisition of coyote logistics see note 7  we distributed  500  million of cash held by a canadian subsidiary to its us parent during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the distribution we recorded additional net income tax expense of  28  million 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized an income tax benefit of  39  million related to pretax marktomarket losses of  118  million on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a lower average statutory tax rate than our us federal statutory tax rate because it was due in part to nonus benefit plans 

other favorable rate impacting items in 2015 include resolution of several us state and local tax matters the extension of favorable us federal tax provisions associated with the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 related to research and development tax credits and work opportunity tax credits and the execution of two bilateral advance pricing agreements these agreements established intercompany transfer pricing arrangements between the us and certain nonus jurisdictions related to our small package operations for tax years 2010 through 2019 

2014 discrete items 

in 2014 we recorded a 415 million tax benefit related to a pretax charge of 1102 billion for certain health and welfare plan changes see note 5 this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average statutory tax rate than our us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local taxes

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recognized an income tax benefit of 392 million related to pretax marktomarket losses of 1062 billion on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans this income tax benefit was generated at a higher average statutory tax rate than the us federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of us state and local taxes 

as described in the items affecting comparability  section certain items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted income taxes in the discussion that follows 

2016  compared to 2015   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased to 345 in 2016 from 340 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in favorable discrete tax adjustments relative to 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income 

2015  compared to 2014   

our adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 340 in 2015 from 355 in 2014 primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments related to 1 prior years deferred tax balances 2 execution of advance pricing agreements with certain foreign tax jurisdictions 3 resolution of several us state and local tax matters and 4 the extension of several previously expired us tax provisions in 2015 these benefits were partially offset by the additional us tax expense associated with a cash distribution from a canadian subsidiary to its us parent

cash flows from operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout 2014 to 2016 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by 1527 billion in 2014 and 33 million in 2015 due to certain transactions resulting from the ratification of our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters these transactions are discussed further in the collective bargaining agreements section 

 most of the remaining variability in operating cash flows during the 2014 to 2016 time period relates to the funding of our companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 apart from the transactions described above operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our working capital position payments for income taxes and changes in hedge margin payables and receivables cash payments for income taxes were 2064 1913 and 1524 billion for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and were primarily impacted by the timing of current tax deductions the net hedge margin collateral paidreceived from derivative counterparties was 142 170 and 421 million during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs

as of december 31 2016  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  4567 billion  of which 2192 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends however not all international balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided 

cash flows from investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately 4 billion 

capital spending on aircraft increased in 2016 compared to the 2014 to 2015 periods due to firm commitments to purchase 14 new boeing 7478f cargo aircraft capital spending on vehicles decreased during the 2014 to 2016 period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit largely due to the timing of vehicle replacements capital expenditures on buildings and facilities also increased in the 2014 to 2016 period and included hub automation and capacity expansion projects in the us during 2016 as well as expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia 

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2014 to 2016 the net decline in finance receivables in the 2014 to 2016 period was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period 

cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2014 to 2016 period was largely due to the acquisitions of iparcel llc 2014 polar speed distribution limited 2014 poltraft sp zoo 2015 parcel pro inc 2015 coyote logistics midco inc 2015 and marken 2016 as well as other smaller acquisitions

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our noncurrent investments and restricted cash balances capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and various other items in 2016 2015 and 2014 we increased the noncurrent investments and restricted cash balance associated with our selfinsurance requirements by 3 0 and 17 million respectively 

cash flows from financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



 in may 2016  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  80  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2013the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date during the first quarter of 2016 we exercised a capped call option that we entered into in 2015 which allowed us to repurchase 02 million class b shares the 25 million premium payment for this capped call option was classified as other financing activities in 2015 as of december 31 2016  we had  6155  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program we anticipate repurchasing approximately  18  billion of shares in 2017  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2017 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 078 to 083 per share a 6 increase 

issuances of debt in 2016 consisted of floating rate senior notes totaling 226 million two series of fixed rate senior notes each 500 million and euro denominated fixed rate senior note totaling €500 million 549 million issuances of debt in 2015 consisted of floating rate senior notes totaling 144 million euro denominated floating rate senior notes totaling €500 million 547 million euro denominated fixed rate senior notes totaling €700 million 765 million and facility bonds associated with our philadelphia pennsylvania airport facilities totaling 100 million the remainder consisted primarily of commercial paper issuances of debt in 2014 consisted primarily of commercial paper

in 2016 there were no repayments of fixed rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes repayments of debt in 2015 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 100 million facility bonds associated with our philadelphia pennsylvania airport facilities repayments of debt in 2014 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 10 billion senior fixed rate notes in april 2014 the remaining repayments of debt during the 2014 through 2016 time period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

        the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs the following is a summary of our commercial paper program amount in millions 







the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the level of stock option exercises by employees in the 2014 through 2016 period 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors net cash outflows from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 54 17 and 47 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively cash outflows related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards were 167 217 and 224 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

see note 8  to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and debt covenants 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8  to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2016  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets goods or services that are legally binding including contracts for aircraft construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2016  we have firm commitments to purchase 14 new boeing 7478f cargo aircraft the 14 aircraft are to be delivered between 2017 and 2020 options for 14 additional 7478f cargo aircraft are also included in the contract but are not included in the commitment table above 

pension fundings represent a voluntary contribution for 2017 there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates and changes to pension plan funding regulations a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in the world equity or bond markets could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2019 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 5  to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately  200 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  189  billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2016  we had  730  million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2016  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  149  million associated with ups capital 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

collective bargaining agreements 

status of collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 268000  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters during 2014 the teamsters ratified a new national master agreement “nma” with ups that will expire on july 31 2018 the economic provisions in the nma included wage rate increases as well as increased contribution rates for healthcare and pension benefits most of these economic provisions were retroactive to august 1 2013 which was the effective date of the nma in the second quarter of 2014 we remitted 278 million for these retroactive economic benefits this payment had an immaterial impact on net income as these retroactive economic benefits had been accrued since the july 31 2013 expiration of the prior agreement 

in addition to the retroactive economic provisions of the nma there were certain changes to the delivery of healthcare benefits that were effective at various dates these changes impact approximately 36000 fulltime and 73000 parttime active employees covered by the nma and the ups freight collective bargaining agreement collectively referred to as the “nma group” as well as approximately 16000 employees covered by other collective bargaining agreements the “nonnma group” these provisions are discussed further below in the changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits section 

we have approximately 2600  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa which became amendable at the end of 2011 on august 31 2016 the ipa members voted to ratify a new fiveyear labor contract terms of the agreement became effective september 1 2016 and run through september 1 2021 the economic provisions in the agreement included pay increases a signing bonus and enhanced pension benefits 

our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable november 1 2013 we are currently in negotiations with teamsters local 2727 in addition approximately 3000  of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” that will expire on july 31 2019 

multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements

changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits 

prior to ratification the nma group and nonnma group employees received their healthcare benefits through upssponsored active and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans effective june 1 2014 we ceased providing healthcare benefits to active nma group employees through these upssponsored benefit plans and the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for active employees was assumed by three separate multiemployer healthcare funds the “funds” the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for the active nonnma group employees was also assumed by the funds on various dates up to january 1 2015 depending on the ratification date of the applicable collective bargaining agreement we will make contributions to the funds based on negotiated fixed hourly or monthly contribution rates for the duration of the nma and other applicable collective bargaining agreements 

additionally the funds assumed the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the employees in the nma group who retire on or after january 1 2014 the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation for the employees in the nonnma group was assumed by the funds for employees retiring on or after january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 depending on the applicable collective bargaining agreement in exchange for the assumption of the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the nma group and nonnma group we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds in the second quarter of 2014 upssponsored health and welfare benefit plans retained responsibility for providing postretirement healthcare coverage for employees in the nma group who retired from ups prior to january 1 2014 and for employees in the nonnma group who retire from ups prior to the january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 effective date in the applicable collective bargaining agreement 

accounting impact of health and welfare plan changes 

income statement impact 

we recorded a pretax charge of 1066 billion 665 million aftertax in the second quarter of 2014 for the health and welfare plan changes described above the components of this charge which was included in compensation and benefits expense in the statement of consolidated income are as follows 

 we recorded an additional pretax charge of 36 million 22 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2014 upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements covering the nonnma group related to the remeasurement and settlement of the postretirement benefit obligation associated with those employees 

balance sheet and cash flow impact 

during 2014 as part of the health and welfare plan changes described previously we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds which was accounted for as a settlement of our postretirement benefit obligations we received approximately 854 million of cash tax benefits through reduced us federal and state quarterly income tax payments in 2014 

for nma group employees who retired prior to january 1 2014 and remained with the upssponsored health and welfare plans the changes to the contributions benefits and cost sharing provisions in these plans resulted in an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation and a corresponding decrease in pretax accumulated other comprehensive income of 13 million upon ratification

anticipated benefits of health and welfare plan changes 

we believe we have obtained several benefits as a result of these health and welfare plan changes including 

 minimize impact of healthcare law changes multiemployer plans have several advantages under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 including reduced transitional fees and the ability to limit the impact of future excise taxes 

mitigate demographic issues this helps reduce the potential impact of increased early retirements by employees

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2016  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the us domestic package europe asia americas and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups mail innovations ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st  for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we routinely monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2016  2015  or 2014  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value for any of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2016  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200  million and licenses with a carrying value of  4  million as of december 31 2016  are considered to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value these assumptions include projections of future revenues market royalty rates tax rates discount rates and other relevant variables the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions 

all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model there were no impairments of any indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets in 2016  2015  or 2014  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate return on assets and healthcare cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  in millions

pension backstop 

ups was a contributing employer to the central state pensions fund cspf until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable shares of unfunded vested benefits by paying a 61 billion withdrawal liability under a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the upsibt full time employee pension plan upsibt plan for ups participants whose last employer was ups and who had not retired as of january 1 2008 the ups transfer group in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf 

in december 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval in september 2015 the cspf submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the us department of treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the cspf participants including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and the cspf failed to comply with its contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefits to the ups transfer group under the terms of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may 6 2016 the us department of treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the mpra 

the cspf has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits although there are numerous factors that could affect the cspfs funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent as they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefits thereby increasing the current projected benefits obligation for the upsibt plan by approximately 4 billion the cspf has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency 

the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the upsibt plan is subject to a number of significant uncertainties including actions that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these actions include whether the cspf will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefits are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal positions as well as the effect of discount rates and various other actuarial assumptions 

we account for this potential obligation under accounting standards codification topic 715  compensation  retirement benefits asc 715 under asc 715 we are required to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions including the eventual outcome this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december 31st measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problems facing multiemployer pension plans is intervention by the federal government asc 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law in making a best estimate of pension liabilities our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2016 does not incorporate this solution rather our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf’s solvency concerns is that the cspf will make another mpra filing to forestall insolvency without reducing benefits to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempts to reduce benefits for the ups transfer group under a mpra filing we would be in a strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefits cannot be reduced without our consent and such a reduction without first exhausting reductions to other groups in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate as of the measurement date of december 31 2016 is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefits of the upsibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase as these uncertainties are resolved we will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the upsibt plan in accordance with asc 715

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2016  we had  188 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as appropriate we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2016  2015  and 2014  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was  102  and  118  million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was  116   121  and  143  million respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2016  and 2015  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forwards as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities and finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2016  and 2015

 competition 

ups is a global leader in logistics we offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and therefore compete with many different local regional national and international carriers our competitors include worldwide postal services various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others including startups that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs through our supply chain service offerings we compete with a number of providers in the supply chain financial services and information technology industries 

competitive strengths 

our competitive strengths include 

global network we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry we provide all types of package service air ground domestic international commercial and residential through a single pickup and delivery service network we also have extensive air freight ocean freight ground freight and logistics networks that provide additional capabilities in the global transportation and logistics market 

our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns 

global presence we serve more than 220  countries and territories around the world we have a significant presence in all of the world’s major economies 

leadingedge technology we are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs improve service and increase efficiency 

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology offerings are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to send manage and track their shipments conveniently but also to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own websites

brand equity we have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service reliability and service innovation the distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity 

distinctive culture we believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive “employeeowner” concept our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927 when our founders who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business first offered stock to employees to encourage employee stock ownership we maintain several stockbased compensation programs 

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and have spent their entire careers with us many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all of our shareowners

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches trends in the ecommerce industry such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such a potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our franchised center locations also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities our and our franchisees’ information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers malicious insiders telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events hackers acting individually or in coordinated groups may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant in august 2014 a broadbased malware intrusion targeting retailers throughout the us was discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately 1 of our franchisees’ locations while the impact of this cyberattack including the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities was not material to our business and our financial results our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate any future breaches may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires or earthquakes epidemics or pandemics or terrorist attacks conflicts or unrest may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in international markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 444000  employees including approximately 362000  in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans the new national master agreement with the ibt includes changes that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts except potential surcharges under the pension protection act of 2006 in the event that a plan enters critical status and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans are impacted by various factors including investment performance health care inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

in addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations we may have additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund the cspf from which ups withdrew in 2007 in return for fully funding its allocable share of unfunded vested benefits thereunder in 2015 cspf submitted a proposed pension suspension plan to the us department of treasury under the multiemployer pension reform act of 2014 “mpra” which proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to cspf participants including to the benefits of certain ups employee participants separately ups agreed to provide supplemental benefits under the upsibt fulltime employee pension plan to offset certain benefit reductions under the cspf we have no other multiemployer pension plans subject to such a funding obligation ups has reviewed the cspf’s proposed plan to evaluate the validity of the actions taken by the cspf the plan’s compliance with the mpra and proposed regulations thereunder and its potential impact on ups’s funding obligations under the upsibt fulltime employee pension plan we are vigorously challenging the proposed suspension plan because it does not fully comply with the law and we do not believe certain actions by cspf are valid accordingly we have not assumed or recognized a liability for supplemental benefits within the upsibt fulltime employee pension plan due to the submission of cspf’s proposed plan to the us department of treasury further we are not able to estimate a range of additional obligations if any or determine whether any such amounts are material due to a number of uncertainties relating to the mpra and proposed regulations thereunder and assumptions made by the cspf in its proposed plan 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

overview 

growth in the us economy proceeded at a moderately slow and uneven pace throughout 2015 resulting in 24 gdp growth for the year with an initial estimate of 18 gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to 2014 consumer spending remains the primary driver of growth in the economy as the combination of low inflation healthy employment growth and a strong dollar have created a favorable environment for us households however much of the growth in consumer spending has been centered in the service sector and not in the manufacturing sector retail sales growth was disappointing throughout most of 2015 and finished the year on a soft note with an underwhelming holiday season ecommerce has been one of the few bright spots for retailers as growth in digital sales far outpaced traditional brickand mortar retailers us manufacturing continues to struggle with weak export demand and sharp cutbacks in the mining sector combining to curb domestic industrial production and investment spending in the economy these conditions are likely to continue in upcoming quarters and growth is expected to remain fairly uneven in the economy as the bifurcation of the economy continues through the first half of 2016 given these trends overall volume grew slowly during 2015 with those products most aligned with the retail industry and ecommerce in particular experiencing the most growth 

global gdp forecasts have been reduced in recent months largely driven by growth concerns in emerging markets china’s economy continues to decelerate particularly in the manufacturing sector and recent financial market turmoil has raised concerns that the pace of deceleration might be faster than initially expected this in turn has driven down commodity prices worldwide and weakened the outlook for china’s major trading partners such as the eu and other emerging asian nations the fall in commodity prices has negative implications for many other emerging economies particularly in latin america and russia which rely on commodity exports to drive economic growth outside of emerging markets growth in the developed world appears to be continuing at a moderate pace and advanced economies such as the many eu nations should continue to experience solid growth in 2016 the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide combined with a trend towards more intraregional trade has continued the shifting of trade patterns and weakened demand in certain trade lanes as a result of these circumstances we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume levels our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 

while the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in 2015 we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the us and internationally to 1 improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network 2 improve yield management and 3 increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments most notably the continued deployment of technology improvements including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on road integrated optimization and navigation system  orion should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency flexibility and reliability additionally we have continued to utilize newly expanded operating facilities to improve timeintransit for shipments in each region

items affecting comparability 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 



these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted operating expenses operating profit operating margin and income taxes in the discussion that follows 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charge 

in 2015 we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 118 million 79 million aftertax on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 62 million international package segment 44 million and supply chain  freight segment 12 million 

in 2014 we recognized pretax marktomarket losses in compensation and benefits expense of 1062 billion 670 million aftertax on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 660 million international package segment 200 million and supply chain  freight segment 202 million 

no marktomarket gain or loss was incurred in 2013 as the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities only resulted in adjustments within the 10 corridor and thus only impacted accumulated other comprehensive income 

the table below indicates the amounts associated with each component of the pretax marktomarket loss as well as the weightedaverage actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit costs for each year

the 118 million and 1062 billion pretax marktomarket losses for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively were comprised of the following components 

2015  118 million pretax marktomarket loss    

 2014  1062 billion pretax marktomarket loss   

 health and welfare plan charges 

in connection with the ratification of our national master agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters in 2014 we incurred pretax charges totaling 1102 billion 687 million aftertax associated with changes in the delivery of healthcare benefits to certain active and retired union employees these charges are discussed in further detail in the collective bargaining agreements section these charges impacted our us domestic package segment 990 million international package segment 28 million and supply chain  freight segment 84 million 

tnt termination fee and related expenses 

on january 30 2013 the european commission issued a formal decision prohibiting our proposed acquisition of tnt express nv tnt express as a result of the prohibition by the european commission the condition of our offer requiring european union competition clearance was not fulfilled and our proposed acquisition of tnt express could not be completed given this outcome ups and tnt express entered a separate agreement to terminate the merger protocol and we withdrew our formal offer for tnt express we paid a termination fee to tnt express of €200 million 268 million under this agreement and also incurred transactionrelated expenses of 16 million during 2013 the combination of these items resulted in a pretax charge of 284 million 177 million aftertax which impacted our international package segment

gain upon the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 

subsequent to the termination of the merger protocol we liquidated a foreign subsidiary that would have been used to acquire the outstanding shares of tnt express in connection with the proposed acquisition upon the liquidation of this subsidiary in 2013 we realized a pretax foreign currency gain of 245 million 213 million aftertax which impacted our international package segment 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

as discussed in our critical accounting policies and estimates we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor for companysponsored pension and postretirement liabilities immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost in our results of operations and the discussions that follow we have presented adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plans in our quarterly reporting under us gaap and reflects assumptions utilizing the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that can be used to better compare yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2015  2014  or 2013

volume 

2015  compared to 2014   

our total volume increased in 2015 largely due to faster growing premium air products and continued growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales businesstoconsumer shipments which represent more than 45 of total us domestic package volume grew nearly 3 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments businesstobusiness volume grew 1 in 2015 largely due to increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping 

among our air products we experienced increased volume for our deferred air services in 2015 particularly for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping such as our residential second day air package and three day select products we also experienced solid growth in our businesstobusiness deferred air volume largely due to increases in the retail sector next day air volume increased 33 in 2015 due to strong growth in ecommerce 

the increase in ground volume in 2015 was driven by growth in residential ground and surepost volume and businesstobusiness shipping activity the continued growth in ecommerce drove demand for our surepost service with volume increasing 3 in 2015 the increase in businesstobusiness ground volume was largely due to growth in omnichannel retail volume the increased use of our returns service offerings and the growth in shipments from the retail sector 

2014  compared to 2013   

our total volume increased in 2014 largely due to continued solid growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales   businesstoconsumer shipments which represent more than 45 of total us domestic package volume grew 12 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments ups surepost volume increased more than 45 in 2014 and accounted for approximately half of the overall volume growth for the segment businesstobusiness volume grew 3 in 2014 largely due to increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping additionally businesstobusiness volume was positively impacted by growth in shipments from the industrial automotive and government sectors 

among our air products volume increased in 2014 for both our next day air and deferred services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping particularly our residential second day air package product our businesstobusiness air volume increased slightly as well largely due to growth in the retail and industrial sectors this growth was slightly offset by a decline in air letter volume which was negatively impacted by some competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry the growth in premium and deferred air volume continues to be impacted by economic conditions and changes in our customers supply chain networks the combination of these factors influences their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments and therefore favoring the use of our deferred air services 

the increase in ground volume in 2014 was driven by our surepost service offering which had a volume increase of more than 45 for the year additionally we experienced moderate volume growth in our traditional residential and commercial ground services demand for surepost and our traditional residential products continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers and other large customers the growth in businesstobusiness ground volume was largely due to growth in omnichannel retail volume the increased use of our returns service offerings and the growth in shipments from the industrial sector 

rates and product mix 

2015  compared to 2014   

overall revenue per piece increased 03 in 2015 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates which took effect on december 29 2014 and an increase in surcharge rates that took effect november 2 2015 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates on ups next day air ups 2nd day air ups 3 day select and ups ground additionally a pricing change involving the application of dimensional weight pricing to all ups ground services took effect on december 29 2014 on november 2 2015 the surcharge increased for over maximum packages and the indices for ground air and international fuel surcharges were adjusted 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries

revenue per piece decreased for our next day air and deferred air products in 2015 as lower fuel surcharge rates more than offset the positive impact of the base rate increase product mix adversely impacted next day air and deferred revenue per piece as we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted next day air and deferred revenue per piece due to faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our small and middlemarket customers 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2015 primarily due to the base rate increase the dimensional weight pricing change and product mix additionally the revenue per piece for our traditional ground residential products was positively impacted by our decision not to pursue certain loweryielding customer contract renewals these factors were partially offset by declines in fuel surcharge rates as well as changes in customer mix as we experienced faster volume growth among our larger customers 

2014  compared to 2013   

overall revenue per piece decreased 15 in 2014 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates

revenue per piece increased for our next day air products in 2014 largely due to the base rate increase an increase in the average weight per package and a shift in product mix from loweryielding letters towards higheryielding packages revenue per piece declined for our deferred products in 2014 as customer and product mix changes more than offset the increase in base rates product mix adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece as we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece due to faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middlemarket customers 

ground revenue per piece decreased in 2014 as customer and product mix changes more than offset the impact of the base rate increase customer and product mix changes adversely impacted revenue per piece as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2014 relative to 2013 came from lighterweight shipments including more than 45 volume growth in surepost and larger customers 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 843 million in 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge rates caused by declining jet and diesel fuel prices however the impact of lower fuel prices was partially mitigated by changes to the fuel surcharge indices as well as the overall increase in package volume for the period in 2014 total fuel surcharge revenue declined by 8 million as lower fuel surcharge rates driven by lower fuel prices more than offset the impact of increased air and ground volume

operating expenses 

2015  compared to 2014   

adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 576 million in 2015 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 602 million the costs of package sorting up 172 million and indirect operating costs up 122 million the cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground transportation network down 319 million these costs were impacted by several factors 

 2014  compared to 2013   

adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1871 billion in 2014 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 821 million the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up 719 million and the costs of package sorting up 167 million these costs were impacted by several factors

2015  compared to 2014   

adjusted operating profit increased 320 million in 2015 compared with 2014 while the adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 131 overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network leading to improved productivity resulting in a lower cost per piece discussed previously this was slightly offset by higher pension and healthcare costs contractual union wage increases and the negative impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense

volume 

2015  compared to 2014   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2015 largely due to continued strength in businesstoconsumer volume as well as strong demand from several sectors including healthcare and diversified vehicles and parts 

we continued to experience solid export volume growth in 2015 the growth was mainly driven by our european and americas operations which experienced solid increases in volume to most regions of the world european export volume increased in 2015 with particular strength in the europetous intraeuropean and europetoamericas trade lanes americas export volume increased in 2015 with solid growth in the americastoeurope and americastous trade lanes however asian export volume declined across all trade lanes due to the economic slowdown throughout the region particularly china while us export volume declined largely due to the impact of the stronger us dollar export volume growth was led by our transborder products such as transborder standard and transborder express

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment decreased 1115 billion in 2015 this decrease was mostly due to currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense 

 the decrease in operating expenses was impacted by the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which decreased 617 million as well as pickup and delivery costs which decreased 332 million the decreases in network and pickup and delivery costs were largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements lower fuel expense and a reduction in expense for outside transportation carriers due to lower fuel surcharges passed to us from the carriers additionally network costs were mitigated by restraining the growth in aircraft block hours down 11 in 2015 as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network this was achieved with a 32 increase in international export volume and continuing air product service enhancements 

the remaining decrease in operating expenses in 2015 was largely due to reductions of indirect operating costs and the cost of package sorting indirect operating costs decreased 130 million and the cost of package sorting decreased by 36 million both of these decreases were mainly attributable to the impact of currency 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 40 in 2015

2014  compared to 2013 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 450 million in 2014 this increase was driven by the cost of pickup and delivery which increased 201 million as well as the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which increased 150 million the increases in pickup and delivery and network costs were largely driven by higher package volume and higher expense for outside transportation carriers which was impacted by network capacity constraints in europe however network cost increases were mitigated by reductions in average daily aircraft block hours   11 decrease in 2014 as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network this was achieved even with a 78 increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements 

the remaining increase in adjusted operating expenses in 2014 was largely due to the costs of package sorting which increased 52 million and was impacted by volume growth additionally indirect operating costs increased 47 million in 2014 and were affected by various factors including restructuring charges foreign currency remeasurement losses legal contingency accruals bad debt expense and several other factors 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 16 in 2014 

operating profit and margin 

2015  compared to 2014 

adjusted operating profit increased by 276 million in 2015 while the adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points operating profit and margin were positively affected by several factors including base rate increases modifications to the fuel surcharge indices and the net impact of fuel fuel expense declined at a faster rate than fuel surcharge revenue these items were partially offset by the net impact of currency exchange rate movements including our currency hedging gains which reduced operating profit by 22 million when comparing 2015 with 2014 

2014  compared to 2013 

adjusted operating profit increased by 109 million in 2014 while the adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points these increases were largely due to moderate revenue growth combined with the mitigation of expense increases through improved productivity 

in addition to the aforementioned factors the net impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue grew faster than fuel expense and the net impact of currency remeasurement and translation gains resulted in a favorable impact on operating profit of 127 million when comparing 2014 with 2013 fuel surcharge revenue was favorably impacted during 2014 by rate increases to the fuel surcharge index operating profit in 2014 was negatively impacted by 21 million due to a restructuring charge and related costs in europe

freight revenue decreased 167 million in 2015 driven by lower tonnage of 71 and a 157 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue due to lower diesel fuel prices the decline in average daily shipments and the reduction in weight per shipment was impacted by revenue management initiatives customer mix and an overall decline in market demand ltl revenue per hundredweight increased slightly as ltl base rate increases averaging 49 took effect on december 29 2014 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico    

revenue for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 99 million in 2015 due to revenue growth from our service contracts with the us postal service and at the ups store ups capital and ups customer solutions 

2014  compared to 2013 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased 266 million in 2014 compared with 2013 forwarding revenue increased for the year primarily due to volume and tonnage growth in our international air freight north american air freight and ocean freight businesses which were impacted by improving overall market demand this was partially offset however by lower rates charged to our customers in our international air forwarding business which was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes particularly the asiaoutbound market revenue for our logistics products increased in 2014 as we experienced solid growth in our mail services healthcare and retail distribution solutions 

freight revenue increased 166 million in 2014 driven by solid increases in average daily ltl shipments and ltl revenue per hundredweight the increase in average daily ltl shipments in 2014 was impacted by overall us economic growth and improving ltl market conditions the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management as well as general rate increases averaging 44 and 59 that took effect in march 2014 and june 2013 respectively covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by 13 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume 

revenue for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 26 million in 2014 due to revenue growth at the ups store ups capital and ups customer solutions however this was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

operating expenses 

2015  compared to 2014 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased 91 million in 2015 compared with 2014 this increase was largely due to the acquisition of coyote during the third quarter of 2015 partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense purchased transportation expense increased by 37 million in 2015 due to the acquisition of coyote offset by lower tonnage fuel expense and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates the remaining operating expense increase was related to several other expense categories including payroll and benefits expense 

freight adjusted operating expenses decreased 151 million in 2015 while the total adjusted cost per ltl shipment decreased 19 the decrease in adjusted operating expense was largely due to the cost associated with operating our linehaul network which decreased 142 million and decreases in pickup and delivery expenses the decreases in network costs and pickup and delivery expenses were driven by a reduction in fuel expense and expense for outside transportation carriers largely due to lower ltl volume and fuel surcharges passed to us from the carriers these benefits were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of 3 million for 2015 largely due to higher pension costs impacted by lower discount rates for upssponsored plans  

operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 76 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to ups capital and our service contracts with the us postal service

2014  compared to 2013 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased 266 million in 2014 largely due to higher purchased transportation and employee compensation expenses purchased transportation expense increased by 229 million for the year primarily due to higher volume and tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business and higher rates charged to us by thirdparty transportation carriers compensation and benefits expense increased 47 million in 2014 due to merit salary and wage increases for management and hourly employees along with an increase in the overall size of the workforce 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 140 million in 2014 while the total adjusted cost per ltl shipment increased 20 the increase in adjusted operating expenses was largely due to pickup and delivery expenses which increased 96 million and the costs associated with operating our linehaul network which increased 65 million the increases in pickup and delivery and network costs were primarily due to contractual wage increases higher ltl volume and increased costs associated with outside contract and rail carriers partially offsetting these cost increases were reductions in indirect operating expenses including lower auto liability and workers compensation costs which were impacted by operational safety and claims management initiatives as well as lower pension expense 

operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 8 million in 2014 compared with 2013 

operating profit and margin 

2015  compared to 2014 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit increased by 51 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to improved results in our international air business partially offset by the impact of coyote acquisition costs the net impact of fuel costs and revenue management initiatives had a positive impact on operating profit operating results for the international air forwarding business improved as the rates at which we procure capacity from third party air carriers decreased faster than the rates we charge our customers profitability in our ocean freight unit grew largely as a result of transportation expense decreasing at a faster rate than the rates we charge our customers   however operating profit for the logistics unit declined as investments in technology and infrastructure continued to pressure distribution margins during 2015 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit decreased 16 million in 2015 compared with 2014 as declines in tonnage and increased pension costs more than offset the increased ltl revenue per hundredweight realized during the year 

the combined operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 23 million in 2015 primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and our service contracts with the us postal service 

2014  compared to 2013 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit remained comparable between 2014 and 2013 and was impacted by several factors operating profit in the international air forwarding business declined in 2014 as continued excess market capacity in key trade lanes reduced the margin between the rates we charge our customers and the rates at which we procure capacity from third party air carriers we increased profitability in our north american air freight ocean freight distribution and mail services units in 2014 as a result of improving market demand and cost controls 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 26 million in 2014 compared with 2013 as shipment growth increased yields and higher productivity more than offset contractual union wage increases 

the combined operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 18 million in 2014 primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and ups customer solutions

 repairs and maintenance 

2015  compared to 2014   

the 29 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in airframe and aircraft engine repair and component replacement costs largely in our boeing 747 and 767 aircraft fleets the remaining increase was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations primarily due to the growth in the size of our vehicle fleet 

2014  compared to 2013   

the 131 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2014 was primarily due to a 93 million increase in airframe and aircraft engine repair and component replacement costs largely in our boeing 747 and 767 aircraft fleets the remaining increase was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations primarily due to the growth in the size of our vehicle fleet

depreciation and amortization 

2015  compared to 2014   

depreciation and amortization expense increased 161 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to three factors 1 amortization expense increased largely due to new internally developed capitalized software as well as intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions 2 depreciation expense for buildings and facilities increased due to new leasehold improvements and purchases of new equipment and 3 depreciation expense on vehicles increased due to the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations 

2014  compared to 2013 

the 56 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a 45 million increase in the depreciation expense on vehicles due to the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations additionally amortization expense increased 20 million primarily related to intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions these factors were partially offset by a decrease in building and facility depreciation as several operating facilities became fullydepreciated

 fuel 

2015  compared to 2014 

the 1401 billion decrease in fuel expense in 2015 was primarily due to lower fuel prices which decreased fuel expense by 1383 billion increases in fuel efficiency fuel hedging activities alternative fuel credits and fewer miles driven by freight and international package decreased expense by 99 million these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 82 million related to increases in aircraft block hours and domestic package delivery stops and miles driven due to higher volume 

2014  compared to 2013 

the 144 million decrease in fuel expense in 2014 was primarily due to lower fuel prices net of hedging activity which decreased fuel expense by 180 million in 2014 this was partially offset by higher fuel usage due to an increase in aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven which increased expense by 36 million 

other occupancy 

2015  compared to 2014 

the 22 million decrease in other occupancy expense in 2015 was largely due to a decrease in facility rent expense and utility costs but partially offset by an increase in facility maintenance expense 

2014  compared to 2013 

the increase in other occupancy expense in 2014 was largely due to an increase in facility rent expense 25 million property taxes 10 million and natural gas and electric utility costs 32 million the increase in rent property taxes and utilities expense was impacted by new leases on facilities to support the growth of our us domestic package operations additionally adverse weather conditions in the us in the early months of 2014 resulted in 15 million of increased snow removal costs at our operating facilities 

other expenses 

2015  compared to 2014 

the 98 million increase in other expenses in 2015 was caused by a number of factors automotive liability insurance 

expense increased 36 million largely due to established estimates of the loss that will ultimately be incurred on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported and take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses outside professional service fees increased 16 million primarily due to transaction costs associated with coyote advertising expense increased 15 million mostly driven by the united problem solver campaign we also incurred increases in several other expense categories including software license fees computer supplies and employee expense reimbursement these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and other items

investment income 

2015  compared to 2014 

the decrease in investment income was primarily due to lower realized gains on the sale of investments in 2015 compared with 2014 and a decline in interest income this was partially offset by a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships 

2014  compared to 2013 

the increase in investment income in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships this was partially offset by a decline in interest income largely due to having a lower average balance of invested assets in 2014 

interest expense 

2015  compared to 2014 

interest expense decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 largely due to a decrease in effective interest rates related to the termination of our british pound sterling crosscurrency interest rate swaps the prior year repayment of senior notes at maturity and the impact of foreign currency this was partially offset by an increase in average outstanding commercial paper and longterm debt 

2014  compared to 2013 

interest expense decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to having a lower average balance of debt outstanding in addition interest expense declined due to a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps in 2014 compared with 2013

our effective tax rate is affected by recurring factors such as statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions we operate in and the relative amounts of taxable income we earn in those jurisdictions it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year see note 13  to the audited consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the significant recurring and discrete items affecting our effective tax rate as described in the items affecting comparability  section certain items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted income taxes in the discussion that follows 

2015  compared to 2014   

our adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 340 in 2015 from 355 in 2014 primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments related to 1 prior years deferred tax balances 2 execution of advance pricing agreements with certain foreign tax jurisdictions 3 resolution of several us state and local tax matters and 4 the extension of several previously expired us tax provisions in 2015 these benefits were partially offset by the additional us tax expense associated with a cash distribution from a canadian subsidiary to its us parent 

2014  compared to 2013   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly to 355 in 2014 from 354 in 2013 due to a decrease in us federal and state tax credits relative to total pretax income which was largely offset by favorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income

operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2013 to 2015 time period operating cash flow was adversely impacted by 1527 billion in 2014 and 33 million in 2015 due to certain transactions resulting from the ratification of our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters these transactions are discussed further in the collective bargaining agreements section 

 most of the remaining variability in operating cash flows during the 2013 to 2015 time period relates to the funding of our companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension ups retirement and ups pension plans

apart from the transactions described above operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our working capital position payments for income taxes and changes in hedge margin payables and receivables cash payments for income taxes were 1913 1524 and 2712 billion for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively and were primarily impacted by the timing of current tax deductions the net hedge margin collateral received from derivative counterparties was 170 421and 67 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively due to the increased net fair value asset position of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs 

as of december 31 2015  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  4726 billion  of which 2516 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends however not all international balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided 

investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately 28 billion 

capital spending on aircraft declined over the 2013 to 2015 period as we completed the scheduled deliveries of a previous order for the boeing 767300erf aircraft in 2013 capital spending on vehicles increased during the 2013 to 2015 period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit due to vehicle replacements technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth capital expenditures on buildings and facilities also increased in the 2013 to 2015 period and included hub automation and capacity expansion projects in the us during 2015 as well as expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia including a 200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne germany that was completed in 2014

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to real estate sales during the 2013 through 2015 period as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2013 the net decline in finance receivables in the 2013 through 2015 period was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

the cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2013 to 2015 period was largely due to the acquisitions of cemelog ltd in hungary 2013 iparcel llc in the us 2014 polar speed distribution limited in the uk 2014 poltraft sp zoo in poland 2015 parcel pro inc in the us 2015 and coyote logistics midco inc 2015 as well as other smaller acquisitions 

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our restricted cash balances capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and various other items in 2015 2014 and 2013 we increased the restricted cash balance associated with our selfinsurance requirements by 0 17 and 137 million respectively 

financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



 on february 14 2013  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  100  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2012 the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2015  we had  1441  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program we anticipate repurchasing approximately  27  billion of shares in 2016  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 073 to 078 per share a 7 increase

issuances of debt in 2015 consisted of floating rate senior notes totaling 144 million euro denominated floating rate senior notes totaling €500 million 547 million euro denominated fixed rate senior notes totaling €700 million 765 million and facility bonds associated with our philadelphia pennsylvania airport facilities totaling 100 million the remainder consisted primarily of commercial paper issuances of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of commercial paper 

repayments of debt in 2015 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 100 million facility bonds associated with our philadelphia pennsylvania airport facilities repayments of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 10 and 175 billion senior fixed rate notes that matured in april 2014 and january 2013 respectively the remaining repayments of debt during the 2013 through 2015 time period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

we had 2965 billion of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2015 which includes euro denominated commercial paper totaling €310 million 339 million and pound sterling denominated commercial paper totaling £234 million 347 million we had 772 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2014 and no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 during 2015 the average balance of our us dollar denominated commercial paper was 2159 billion and the average interest rate paid was 013 the average balance of our pound sterling denominated commercial paper was £241 million 368 million and the average interest rate paid was 050 the average balance of our euro denominated commercial paper was €10 million 11 million and the average interest rate was 009 the average commercial paper balance for 2014 and 2013 was 1356 and 1013 billion and the average interest rate paid was 010 and 007 respectively the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs 

the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the level of stock option exercises by employees in the 2013 through 2015 period 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors cash outflows from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 17 47 and 93 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively cash outflows related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards were 217 224 and 253 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2013 we paid 70 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that operates in the middle east turkey and portions of the central asia region

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015  in millions 



our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8  to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2015  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2015  we have no open aircraft orders 

pension fundings represent a voluntary contribution for 2016 and anticipated required minimum cash contributions that will be made to our qualified us pension plans during 2017 and 2018 these plans are discussed further in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns discount rates and changes to pension plan funding regulations a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2018 cannot be reasonably estimated 

as discussed in note 5  to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately  207 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  1808  billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2015  we had  623  million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2015  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  162  million associated with ups capital

collective bargaining agreements 

status of collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 266000  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” during 2014 the teamsters ratified a new national master agreement “nma” with ups that will expire on july 31 2018 the economic provisions in the nma included wage rate increases as well as increased contribution rates for healthcare and pension benefits most of these economic provisions were retroactive to august 1 2013 which was the effective date of the nma in the second quarter of 2014 we remitted 278 million for these retroactive economic benefits this payment had an immaterial impact on net income as these retroactive economic benefits had been accrued since the july 31 2013 expiration of the prior agreement 

in addition to the retroactive economic provisions of the nma there were certain changes to the delivery of healthcare benefits that were effective at various dates these changes impact approximately 36000 fulltime and 73000 parttime active employees covered by the nma and the ups freight collective bargaining agreement collectively referred to as the “nma group” as well as approximately 16000 employees covered by other collective bargaining agreements the “nonnma group” these provisions are discussed further below in the changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits section 

we have approximately 2600  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa which became amendable at the end of 2011the ongoing contract negotiations between ups and the ipa are in mediation by the national mediation board 

our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable november 1 2013 in addition approximately 3100  of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” that will expire on july 31 2019 

multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 

changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits 

prior to ratification the nma group and nonnma group employees received their healthcare benefits through upssponsored active and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans effective june 1 2014 we ceased providing healthcare benefits to active nma group employees through these upssponsored benefit plans and the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for active employees was assumed by three separate multiemployer healthcare funds the “funds” the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for the active nonnma group employees was also assumed by the funds on various dates up to january 1 2015 depending on the ratification date of the applicable collective bargaining agreement we will make contributions to the funds based on negotiated fixed hourly or monthly contribution rates for the duration of the nma and other applicable collective bargaining agreements 

additionally the funds assumed the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the employees in the nma group who retire on or after january 1 2014 the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation for the employees in the nonnma group was assumed by the funds for employees retiring on or after january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 depending 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

on the applicable collective bargaining agreement in exchange for the assumption of the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the nma group and nonnma group we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds in the second quarter of 2014 upssponsored health and welfare benefit plans retained responsibility for providing postretirement healthcare coverage for employees in the nma group who retired from ups prior to january 1 2014 and for employees in the nonnma group who retire from ups prior to the january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 effective date in the applicable collective bargaining agreement 

accounting impact of health and welfare plan changes 

income statement impact 

we recorded a pretax charge of 1066 billion 665 million aftertax in the second quarter of 2014 for the health and welfare plan changes described above the components of this charge which was included in compensation and benefits expense in the statement of consolidated income are as follows 

 we recorded an additional pretax charge of 36 million 22 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2014 upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements covering the nonnma group related to the remeasurement and settlement of the postretirement benefit obligation associated with those employees 

balance sheet and cash flow impact 

during 2014 as part of the health and welfare plan changes described previously we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds which was accounted for as a settlement of our postretirement benefit obligations see note 4  to the audited consolidated financial statements we received approximately 854 million of cash tax benefits through reduced us federal and state quarterly income tax payments in 2014 

for nma group employees who retired prior to january 1 2014 and remained with the upssponsored health and welfare plans the changes to the contributions benefits and cost sharing provisions in these plans resulted in an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation and a corresponding decrease in pretax accumulated other comprehensive income of 13 million upon ratification 

anticipated benefits of health and welfare plan changes 

we believe we have obtained several benefits as a result of these health and welfare plan changes including

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9  to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a 

contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2015  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2015  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the us domestic package europe asia americas and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight the ups store and ups capital and coyote logistic reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st  for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs capital expenditures and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2015  2014  or 2013  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value for any of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2015  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

a trade name with a carrying value of 200  million and licenses with a carrying value of  4  million as of december 31 2015  are deemed to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model we incurred impairment charges on intangible assets of 13 million during 2013 while there were no impairments of any indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets in 2015  or 2014  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions and 5 changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are reported on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate return on assets and healthcare cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2015  in millions 



 

expense is expected to remain flat in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to the increase in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine ongoing net periodic benefit cost from 436 for 2015 to 481 for 2016 these discount rates represent the combined weightedaverage discount rates for our us and international pension plans as well as our us postretirement medical plans the impact of increases in discount rates is offset primarily by lower than expected asset returns in 2015

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2015  we had  18352 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2015  2014  and 2013  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables pension assets other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

w e allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was  118  and  121  million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was  121   143  and  129  million respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15  to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2015  and 2014  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forwards as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities and finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2015  and 2014

united parcel service inc 

atlanta georgia 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of united parcel service inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2015  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at coyote logistics midco inc which was acquired on august 18 2015 and whose financial statements constitute approximately three percent of total assets one percent of revenues and less than one percent of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at coyote logistics midco inc the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad international operating rights for us airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments ups airlines has international route operating rights granted by the dot and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network the efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on dot and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions 

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft operating procedures transportation of hazardous materials record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable faa regulations in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights involving nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation 

ups aircraft maintenance programs and procedures including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals are approved for all aircraft under faa regulations the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition age and the enactment of additional faa regulatory requirements

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of our large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws regulations and policies both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws regulations and policies that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such a potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report additionally changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our franchised center locations also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities our and our franchisees’ information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers malicious insiders telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events hackers acting individually or in coordinated groups may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers and franchisees or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant in august 2014 a broadbased malware intrusion targeting retailers throughout the us was discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately 1 of our franchisees’ locations while the impact of this cyberattack including the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities was not material to our business and our financial results our efforts to deter identify mitigate andor eliminate any future breaches may not be successful 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires or earthquakes epidemics or pandemics or terrorist attacks conflicts or unrest may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in international markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations we are subject to many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and restrict where we can do business our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to nonus governments 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 435000  employees including approximately 354000  in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and the decreasing trend of discount rates that we use to value our pension liabilities continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans the new national master agreement with the teamsters includes changes that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreedupon amounts except potential surcharges under the pension protection act of 2006 in the event that a plan enters critical status and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiations we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans the funded status of these multiemployer plans are impacted by various factors including investment performance health care inflation changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

us economic growth retail sales and industrial production continued at a moderate pace in 2014 which resulted in growth in the small package delivery market continued strong growth in ecommerce and omnichannel retail sales has driven package volume increases in both commercial and residential products given these trends overall volume growth was strong during the year and products most aligned with businesstoconsumer and retail industry shipments experienced the fastest growth 

economic conditions in europe have deteriorated somewhat as solid growth in the united kingdom is being offset by slower growth in germany and general economic weakness in france and italy economic growth in asia has continued though growth in china has moderated the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide combined with a trend towards more intraregional trade has led to shifting trade patterns and resulted in overcapacity in certain trade lanes these factors have created an environment in which customers are more likely to tradedown from premium express products to standard delivery products in both europe and asia as a result of these circumstances we have adjusted our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume mix levels our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 

while the worldwide economic environment has remained challenging in 2014 we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the us and internationally to 1 improve the flexibility and capacity in our delivery network 2 improve yield management and 3 increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments most notably the continued deployment of technology improvements including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on road integrated optimization and navigation system  orion should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency flexibility and reliability additionally we have continued to adjust our transportation network and utilize new or expanded operating facilities to improve timeintransit for shipments in each region

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge 

in 2012 we recognized an 896 million pretax charge 559 million aftertax for the establishment of a withdrawal liability related to our withdrawal from the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan this charge is discussed in further detail in the collective bargaining agreements section this charge was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income and impacted our us domestic package segment 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

as discussed in our critical accounting policies and estimates we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost in our results of operations and the discussions that follow we have presented adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plans in our quarterly reporting under us gaap and reflects assumptions utilizing the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that can be used to better compare yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors 

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activitybased costing methods these activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2014 2013 or 2012

revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  compared with the corresponding prior year periods 



volume 

2014  compared to 2013   

our total volume increased in 2014 largely due to continued solid growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales   businesstoconsumer shipments which represent more than 45 of total us domestic package volume grew 12 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments ups surepost volume increased more than 45 in 2014 and accounted for approximately half of the overall volume growth for the segment businesstobusiness volume grew 3 in 2014 largely due to increased volume from the retail industry including the use of our solutions for omnichannel including shipfromstore and shiptostore models and returns shipping additionally businesstobusiness volume was positively impacted by growth in shipments from the industrial automotive and government sectors 

among our air products volume increased in 2014 for both our next day air and deferred services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping particularly our residential second day air package product our businesstobusiness air volume increased slightly as well largely due to growth in the retail and industrial sectors this growth was slightly offset by a decline in air letter volume which was negatively impacted by some competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry the growth in premium and deferred air volume continues to be impacted by economic conditions and changes in our customers supply chain networks the combination of these factors influences their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments and therefore favoring the use of our deferred air services 

the increase in ground volume in 2014 was driven by our surepost service offering which had a volume increase of more than 45 for the year additionally we experienced moderate volume growth in our traditional residential and commercial ground services demand for surepost and our traditional residential products continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers and other large customers the growth in businesstobusiness ground volume was largely due to growth in omnichannel retail volume the increased use of our returns service offerings and the growth in shipments from the industrial sector 

2013  compared to 2012   

our overall volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to continued solid growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales however the increase in volume was hindered by slow overall us economic and industrial production growth businesstoconsumer shipments which represent over 40 of total us domestic package volume grew approximately 8 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments growth accelerated during our peak holiday shipping season as businesstoconsumer volume grew over 11 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and businesstoconsumer shipments exceeded 50 of total us domestic package volume for the first time businesstobusiness volume increased slightly in 2013 largely due to increased shipping activity by the retail industry however businesstobusiness volume was negatively impacted by slowing industrial production

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

among our air products volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as growth in our deferred products more than offset a small decline in our next day air services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping including our residential second day air package and residential next day air saver products next day air letter volume decreased approximately 7 for the year and was negatively impacted by competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry our businesstobusiness air volume continued to be impacted by sluggish economic conditions in the us low levels of inventory replenishment among our customers and changes in our customers supply chain networks the combination of these factors influenced our customers sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments and therefore the use of our premium air services 

the increase in ground volume in 2013 was primarily attributed to our traditional residential service offerings and surepost demand for these residential products continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers and other large customers businesstobusiness ground volume also showed a small increase and was positively impacted by the overall expansion of the us retail sector however continued weakness in industrial production hindered growth the increased use of omnichannel retailing including shipfromstore and shiptostore models by customers is also positively impacting volume growth for both our residential and commercial ground products 

rates and product mix 

2014  compared to 2013   

overall revenue per piece decreased 15 in 2014 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on december 30 2013 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and ups ground 

revenue per piece increased for our next day air products in 2014 largely due to the base rate increase an increase in the average weight per package and a shift in product mix from loweryielding letters towards higheryielding packages revenue per piece declined for our deferred products in 2014 as customer and product mix changes more than offset the increase in base rates product mix adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece as we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments which have lower average yields than our heavierweight commercial shipments customer mix also adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece due to the faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middlemarket customers 

ground revenue per piece decreased in 2014 as customer and product mix changes more than offset the impact of the base rate increase customer and product mix changes adversely impacted revenue per piece as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2014 relative to 2013 came from lighterweight shipments including more than 45 volume growth in surepost and larger customers 

2013  compared to 2012   

overall revenue per piece was relatively flat in 2013 compared with 2012 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on december 31 2012 we increased the base rates 65 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indices other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 

revenue per piece increased for next day air in 2013 and was positively impacted by the base rate increase and the loss of some loweryielding letter volume revenue per piece for our deferred products declined as the impact of the base rate increase was more than offset by declines in fuel surcharge rates and changes in customer and product mix revenue per piece for our air products was adversely impacted by the relatively stronger growth in our loweryielding next day air saver and deferred products compared with our premium next day air services as well as the faster growth in lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments additionally revenue per piece was negatively affected by the faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middlemarket customers

results of operations 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the base rate increase however this was partially offset by customer and product mix changes as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2013 relative to 2012 came from lighterweight shipments and larger customers fuel surcharge rate changes adversely impacted ground revenue per piece growth in 2013 compared with 2012 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price in connection with our base rate increase on december 31 2012 we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 and 1 respectively based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



total fuel surcharge revenue declined by 8 million in 2014 as lower fuel surcharge rates driven by lower fuel prices slightly more than offset the impact of increased air and ground volume in 2013 total fuel surcharge revenue declined by 178 million due to lower fuel surcharge rates driven primarily by the reductions in the index on both the air and ground surcharges as well as lower fuel prices 

operating expenses 

2014  compared to 2013   

adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1871 billion in 2014 primarily due to pickup and delivery costs up 821 million the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up 719 million and the costs of package sorting up 167 million these costs were impacted by several factors 

 in the fourth quarter of 2014 adjusted operating expenses increased 94 as decreased productivity higher contract carrier rates and additional union overtime and training hours contributed to approximately 200 million in excess costs in order to process the significant increase in package volume while maintaining service levels we increased our overall capacity through additional staffing more equipment rentals and new operating facilities additionally we elected to operate on one additional day during the fourth quarter of 2014 to further improve service levels however the significant variability in package volume during the holiday shipping season resulted in a suboptimized transportation network and a reduction in productivity average daily union labor hours increased 105 compared with the volume increase of 66 the total adjusted cost per piece in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 10 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2013  compared to 2012   

adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1147 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 this increase was primarily due to pickup and delivery costs which grew 772 million as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 290 million for the year the growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase package driver wage rates rose 22 an increase in average daily driver hours up 22 and an increase in employee pension and healthcare costs partially offsetting these cost increases was a reduction in workers compensation expense due to actuarial adjustments that were largely attributable to operational safety and claims management initiatives 

cost increases have been mitigated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency improved pickup and delivery densities particularly for our residential products have also contained increases in cost these network efficiency improvements allowed us to process increased volume up 37 at a faster rate than the increase in average daily union labor hours up 31 aircraft block hours down 06 and miles driven up 18 in 2013 compared with 2012 as a result the total adjusted cost per piece increased only 04 in 2013 

several factors caused our fourth quarter operating expenses to significantly increase adjusted operating expenses increased 553 million or 73 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the same period of 2012 higherthanplanned volume growth combined with adverse weather conditions and the relatively compressed holiday shipping season in 2013 there were six fewer days between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays in 2013 relative to 2012 resulted in a significant increase in labor hours and the greater use of contract carriers to help meet our service commitments additionally the much laterthananticipated seasonal increase in volume during the fourth quarter strained our transportation network resulting in lower productivity total union labor hours increased 62 while volume increased 56 in the fourth quarter 

operating profit and margin 

2014  compared to 2013   

adjusted operating profit decreased 94 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and was impacted by several factors we incurred approximately 200 million of additional operating costs during the fourth quarter holiday shipping season largely due to decreased productivity higher contract carrier rates and additional union overtime and training hours the unfavorable weather conditions in the us in early 2014 reduced operating profit approximately 200 million in 2014 including the estimated loss in package volume increased guaranteed service refunds to customers and higher operating expenses additionally changes in customer and product mix combined to pressure our revenue per piece these factors were partially offset by solid volume growth and the overall productivity improvements resulting in lower cost per piece discussed previously the combination of these factors led to a 90 basis point decline in our operating margin in 2014 compared with 2013 

2013  compared to 2012   

adjusted operating profit increased 71 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as the volume growth and productivity improvements discussed previously more than offset the pressure on revenue per piece and the adverse impact of fuel overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network resulting in greater productivity and better pickup and delivery density however these factors were partially offset by changes in customer and product mix which combined to pressure our revenue per piece additionally the net impact of fuel adversely affected operating profit by 158 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense 

although annual adjusted operating profit improved in 2013 it declined by 178 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 this decline in profitability was largely due to additional labor and purchased transportation costs as heavierthananticipated volume adverse weather conditions and a compressed holiday shipping season combined to result in approximately 125 to 150 million in extra costs in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition we incurred approximately 50 million in service refunds for unmet delivery commitments in the fourth quarter of 2013 the combination of these factors resulted in a 250 basis point decrease in our fourth quarter operating margin

volume 

2014  compared to 2013   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2014 largely due to strong demand from several economic sectors including retail healthcare industrial and automotive 

we continued to experience strong export volume growth in 2014 with increases from all regions in the world european export volume increased 12 for the year with particular strength in the intraeuropean trade lanes and the europetous trade lane asian export volume increased at a moderate pace with strength in the asiatous and asiatoeurope trade lanes and benefited from technology sector product launches export volume continued to shift towards our standard products such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited as compared with our premium express products such as worldwide express our international customers continue to be impacted by economic pressures and changes in their supply chain networks and the combination of these factors influences their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments 

the strong increase in domestic volume in 2014 was driven by solid volume growth in canada italy spain france and the united kingdom 

2013  compared to 2012   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to growth in key markets in europe as well as canada and mexico 

export volume increased in 2013 and was driven by europe largely in the intraeuropean trade lanes and the americas particularly in the canadatous and mexicotous trade lanes asian export volume grew at a moderate pace due to continued regional economic growth and expansion of our service offerings but was negatively impacted by fewer technology product launches from our customers and a small number of competitive losses volume continued to shift towards our standard products such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited as compared with our premium express products such as worldwide express 

domestic volume increased in 2013 compared to 2012 and was driven by solid volume growth in several key markets including italy canada poland and turkey 

rates and product mix 

2014  compared to 2013 

total average revenue per piece decreased 15 in 2014 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by changes in base rates as well as product mix 

on december 30 2013 we implemented an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide saver ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

currencyadjusted export revenue per piece decreased 31 in 2014 as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates volume for our standard products increased 12 while volume for our premium express products increased 4 additionally currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by shorter average trade lanes due to faster growth in intraregional shipments and changes in customer mix as export volume growth for larger customers exceeded the volume growth for higheryielding middle market customers 

 currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece increased 03 in 2014 and was impacted by base rate increases as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates

2013  compared to 2012 

total average revenue per piece decreased 25 in 2013 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

on december 31 2012 we increased the base rates 65 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing fuel surcharge indices rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

currencyadjusted export revenue per piece decreased 37 in 2013 as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was also negatively affected by the faster growth among our larger customers which tend to have a lower yield than middle market and smaller accounts additionally currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by shorter average trade lanes due to faster growth in intraregional shipments as well as a small impact on pricing from overcapacity in the asia outbound freight market 

 currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece decreased 04 in 2013 domestic revenue per piece was adversely impacted by the faster domestic volume growth in our loweryielding standard service as well as product and customer mix changes in several developed markets 

fuel surcharges 

we maintain fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services the fuel surcharges for international air products originating inside or outside the united states are indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place   in connection with our base rate increase on december 31 2012 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 

total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 2 million in 2014 as the combined impact of international air volume growth and modifications to the fuel surcharge indices were largely offset by declining fuel prices total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 135 million in 2013 largely due to declining fuel prices and the 2 reduction in the index however this was partially offset by increases in international air volume 

operating expenses 

2014  compared to 2013 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 450 million in 2014 this increase was driven by the cost of pickup and delivery which increased 201 million as well as the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which increased 150 million the increases in pickup and delivery and network costs were largely driven by higher package volume and higher expense for outside transportation carriers which was impacted by network capacity constraints in europe however network cost increases were mitigated by reductions in average daily aircraft block hours   11 decrease in 2014 as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network this was achieved even with a 78 increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements 

the remaining increase in adjusted operating expenses in 2014 was largely due to the costs of package sorting which increased 52 million and was impacted by volume growth additionally indirect operating costs increased 47 million in 2014 and were affected by various factors including restructuring charges foreign currency remeasurement losses legal contingency accruals bad debt expense and several other factors 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 16 in 2014

2013  compared to 2012 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 319 million in 2013 compared with 2012 this increase was driven by the cost of pickup and delivery which increased 195 million for the year largely due to higher package volume 

the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network increased 111 million for the year also largely due to higher package volume however network costs were mitigated by a 04 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network this was achieved even with a 64 increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements that occurred during 2013 

the remaining increases in adjusted operating expenses for the year were largely due to the costs of package sorting which was impacted by volume growth and indirect operating costs which were affected by increased expenses associated with aviation security 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 27 in 2013 compared with 2012 

operating profit and margin 

2014  compared to 2013 

adjusted operating profit increased by 109 million in 2014 while the adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points these increases were largely due to moderate revenue growth combined with the mitigation of expense increases through improved productivity 

in addition to the aforementioned factors the net impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue grew faster than fuel expense and the net impact of currency remeasurement and translation gains resulted in a favorable impact on operating profit of 127 million when comparing 2014 with 2013 fuel surcharge revenue was favorably impacted during 2014 by rate increases to the fuel surcharge index operating profit in 2014 was negatively impacted by 21 million due to a restructuring charge and related costs in europe 

2013  compared to 2012 

adjusted operating profit contracted by 08 in 2013 compared with 2012 while the adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points the solid volume growth in 2013 was largely offset by reductions in revenue per piece leading to only slight growth in revenue the net impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense as well as currency remeasurement and translation losses combined to decrease operating profit by 219 million when comparing 2013 with 2012 the combination of low revenue growth and the adverse impact of fuel and currency led to the reduction in adjusted operating margin

freight revenue increased 166 million in 2014 driven by solid increases in average daily ltl shipments and ltl revenue per hundredweight the increase in average daily ltl shipments in 2014 was impacted by overall us economic growth and improving ltl market conditions the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management as well as general rate increases averaging 44 and 59 that took effect in march 2014 and june 2013 respectively covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by 13 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume 

revenue for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 26 million in 2014 due to revenue growth at the ups store ups capital and ups customer solutions however this was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

2013  compared to 2012 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased 485 million in 2013 compared with 2012 forwarding revenue decreased in 2013 primarily due to lower tonnage and rates charged to our customers in our international air forwarding business the reduction in tonnage was caused by several factors including weak overall market demand competitive pressures and our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market the reduction in rates was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes particularly the asiaoutbound market revenue for our logistics products increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as we experienced solid growth in our mail services and healthcare distribution solutions however this was largely offset by revenue declines among our technology customers 

freight revenue increased 242 million in 2013 driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight tonnage and average daily ltl shipments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management as well as general rate increases averaging 59 that took effect on both july 16 2012 and on june 10 2013 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by 18 million in 2013 compared with the prior year due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume in addition our truckload division experienced increased volume and revenue primarily related to our dedicated and nondedicated service offerings 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased revenue by 31 million in 2013 primarily due to growth at ups capital the ups store and ups customer solutions 

operating expenses 

2014  compared to 2013 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased 266 million in 2014 largely due to higher purchased transportation and employee compensation expenses purchased transportation expense increased by 229 million for the year primarily due to higher volume and tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business and higher rates charged to us by thirdparty transportation carriers compensation and benefits expense increased 47 million in 2014 due to merit salary and wage increases for management and hourly employees along with an increase in the overall size of the workforce 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 140 million in 2014 while the total adjusted cost per ltl shipment increased 20 the increase in adjusted operating expenses was largely due to pickup and delivery expenses which increased 96 million and the costs associated with operating our linehaul network which increased 65 million the increases in pickup and delivery and network costs were primarily due to contractual wage increases higher ltl volume and increased costs associated with outside contract and rail carriers partially offsetting these cost increases were reductions in indirect operating expenses including lower auto liability and workers compensation costs which were impacted by operational safety and claims management initiatives as well as lower pension expense 

operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 8 million in 2014 compared with 2013

2013  compared to 2012 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased 388 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to several factors purchased transportation expense declined by 236 million primarily due to lower tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business compensation and benefits expense declined by 59 million largely due to reduced payroll costs and lower expense for workers compensation claims the remaining decrease in expense resulted from lower fuel costs bad debt expense and various other items 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 234 million in 2013 while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 20 the largest component of this increase related to the cost of operating our linehaul network which grew by 62 million as a result of a 37 average daily tonnage increase coupled with wage and purchased transportation increases our truckload division experienced a 48 million increase in costs for the year largely related to the expansion of our dedicated and nondedicated services pickup and delivery costs increased 15 million as a result of higher volume and wage increases but were partially offset by productivity improvements the remaining increase in expense in 2013 was impacted by increases in pension expense and healthcare costs 

adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight decreased 4 million in 2013 compared with 2012 

operating profit and margin 

2014  compared to 2013 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit remained comparable between 2014 and 2013 and was impacted by several factors operating profit in the international air forwarding business declined in 2014 as continued excess market capacity in key trade lanes reduced the margin between the rates we charge our customers and the rates at which we procure capacity from third party air carriers we increased profitability in our north american air freight ocean freight distribution and mail services units in 2014 as a result of improving market demand and cost controls 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 26 million in 2014 compared with 2013 as shipment growth increased yields and higher productivity more than offset contractual union wage increases 

the combined operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 18 million in 2014 primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and ups customer solutions 

2013  compared to 2012 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by 97 million in 2013 compared with 2012 this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business which resulted from competitive pressures combined with weak overall air freight market demand due to continued economic weakness in europe slowing growth in china and a sluggish us economy additionally our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors negatively impacted our results as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from thirdparty transportation carriers and thereby led to a compression in our operating margin 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 8 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as improvements in average daily ltl volume yields and productivity measures including gains in pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization more than offset an increase in wage and benefit expenses 

the combined adjusted operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 35 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and the ups store

compensation and benefits 

2014  compared to 2013 

employee payroll costs increased 1054 billion in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases a 75 increase in average daily union labor hours and a merit salary increase for management employees the increase in average daily union labor hours was impacted by volume growth as well as additional training hours for the seasonal fourth quarter staffing increase additionally adverse weather conditions in the early part of 2014 contributed to an increase in labor hours in the yeartodate comparison 

adjusted benefits expense increased 270 million in 2014 primarily due to increased health and welfare costs payroll taxes and vacation holiday and excused absence expenses however these factors were partially offset by a reduction in pension costs and workers compensation expense these factors are discussed further as follows

employee payroll costs increased 684 million in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases a 31 increase in average daily union labor hours and a merit salary increase for management employees however this was partially offset by an overall reduction in the number of management personnel 

adjusted benefits expense increased 498 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher pension expense increased vacation holiday and excused absence expense and higher health and welfare costs however these items were partially offset by changes in the expense associated with our selfinsurance for worker’s compensation claims these primary factors impacting expense are discussed further as follows 

 repairs and maintenance 

2014  compared to 2013   

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2014 was primarily due to a 93 million increase in airframe and aircraft engine repair and component replacement costs largely in our boeing 747 and 767 aircraft fleets the remaining increase was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations primarily due to the growth in the size of our vehicle fleet 

2013  compared to 2012   

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations these higher costs were impacted by the increase in miles driven in 2013 compared with 2012 as well as the overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations

depreciation and amortization 

2014  compared to 2013   

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a 45 million increase in the depreciation expense on vehicles due to the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations additionally amortization expense increased 20 million primarily related to intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions these factors were partially offset by a decrease in building and facility depreciation as several operating facilities became fullydepreciated 

2013  compared to 2012 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to a 62 million increase in depreciation expense on vehicles this increase was driven by the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet this increase was largely offset by several factors including lower building and facility depreciation and capitalized software amortization

fuel 

2014  compared to 2013 

the 144 million decrease in fuel expense in 2014 was primarily due to lower fuel prices net of hedging activity which decreased fuel expense by 180 million in 2014 this was partially offset by higher fuel usage due to an increase in aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven which increased expense by 36 million 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in fuel expense in 2013 was largely due to the decline in fuel prices primarily jeta fuel prices which decreased expense by 77 million net of hedging this was partially offset by a 14 million increase in overall fuel usage which was primarily due to lower vehicle fuel efficiency and an increase in miles driven 

other occupancy 

2014  compared to 2013 

the increase in other occupancy expense in 2014 was largely due to an increase in facility rent expense 25 million property taxes 10 million and natural gas and electric utility costs 32 million the increase in rent property taxes and utilities expense was impacted by new leases on facilities to support the growth of our us domestic package operations additionally adverse weather conditions in the us in the early months of 2014 resulted in 15 million of increased snow removal costs at our operating facilities 

2013  compared to 2012 

the increase in other occupancy expense in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to higher snow removal costs at our operating facilities an increase in utility expenses as well as higher real estate taxes the relatively cold winter in the united states in 2013 compared with 2012 caused the increase in snow removal costs while increased usage and higher prices of natural gas and electricity resulted in the increase in utility expenses 

other expenses 

2014  compared to 2013 

the 300 million increase in adjusted other expenses in 2014 was impacted by a number of factors transportation equipment rental expense increased 90 million for the year and was affected by the growth in package volume particularly the seasonal volume increase in the fourth quarter we also incurred increases in several other expense categories including transportation security costs employee expense reimbursements and recruitment costs related to training and staffing for the seasonal volume increase in the fourth quarter and legal contingency expenses these increases were partially offset by business interruption insurance claim reimbursements from previous weatherrelated events as well as lower advertising costs 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in adjusted other expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was impacted by a number of factors including decreases in bad debt expense employee expense reimbursements advertising costs telecommunications expenses and nonincome based state and local taxes these decreases in expense were partially offset by increases in auto liability insurance transportation equipment rentals and air cargo handling costs

investment income and interest expense 

the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions 

  



investment income 

2014  compared to 2013 

the increase in investment income in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a 7 million decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships this was partially offset by a decline in interest income largely due to having a lower average balance of invested assets in 2014 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in investment income in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested assets as well as a decline in the average balance of invested assets these factors were partially offset by higher realized gains on the sales of securities in 2013 compared with 2012 

interest expense 

2014  compared to 2013 

interest expense decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 largely due to having a lower average balance of debt outstanding in addition interest expense declined due to a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps in 2014 compared with 2013 

2013  compared to 2012 

interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 largely due to three factors 1 having a greater proportion of our debt swapped to loweryielding variable rates 2 a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps and 3 a lower average balance of debt outstanding these factors were partially offset by the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund

results of operations 

2014  compared to 2013   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly to 355 in 2014 from 354 in 2013 due to a decrease in us federal and state tax credits relative to total pretax income which was largely offset by favorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income 

2013  compared to 2012   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased to 354 in 2013 from 345 in 2012 due to a decrease in us federal and state tax credits relative to total pretax income and unfavorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income

operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2012 to 2014 time period operating cash flow was adversely impacted by 1527 billion due to certain transactions resulting from the ratification of our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters in 2014 these transactions are discussed further in the collective bargaining agreements section 

 most of the remaining variability in operating cash flows during the 2012 to 2014 time period relates to the funding of our companysponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans and related cash tax deductions except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension ups retirement and ups pension plans 

apart from the transactions described above operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our working capital position payments for income taxes and changes in hedge margin payables and receivables in 2014 and 2013 the compressed holiday shipping season resulted in an increase in working capital needs at each yearend period the cash payments for income taxes were 1524 2712 and 1988 billion for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and were primarily impacted by the timing of current tax deductions the net hedge margin collateral received from derivative counterparties was 421 67 and 4 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively due to the increased net fair value asset position of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs 

as of december 31 2014  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was  2291 billion  of which 1072 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries the amount of cash held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends however not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided 

investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately 30 billion 

capital spending on aircraft declined over the 2012 to 2014 period as we completed the scheduled deliveries of a previous order for the boeing 767300erf aircraft capital spending on vehicles increased during the 2012 to 2014 period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit due to vehicle replacements technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth capital expenditures on buildings and facilities also increased in the 2012 to 2014 period and included hub automation and capacity expansion projects in the us during 2014 as well as expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia including a 200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne germany that was completed in 2014

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to real estate sales during the 2012 through 2014 period as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2013 the net decline in finance receivables in the 2012 through 2014 period was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

the cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2012 to 2014 period was largely due to the acquisitions of kiala sa in belgium 2012 cemelog ltd in hungary 2013 iparcel llc in the us 2014 and polar speed distribution limited in the uk 2014 as well as other smaller acquisitions 

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our restricted cash balances capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and various other items in 2014 and 2013 we increased the restricted cash balance associated with our selfinsurance requirements by 17 and 137 million respectively there were no changes in restricted cash in 2012 other than earned interest 

financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



 on february 14 2013  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  100  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2012 the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2014  we had  4152  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program we anticipate repurchasing approximately  27  billion of shares in 2015  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 067 to 073 per share a 9 increase

issuances of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of longermaturity commercial paper issuances of debt in 2012 consisted primarily of senior fixed rate note offerings totaling 175 billion 

repayments of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 10 and 175 billion senior fixed rate notes that matured in april 2014 and january 2013 respectively the remaining repayments of debt during the 2012 through 2014 time period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

we had 772 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2014 and no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 and 2012 the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs the average commercial paper balance was 1356 billion and the average interest rate paid was 010 in 2014 1013 billion and 007 in 2013 and 962 million and 007 in 2012 respectively 

the variation in cash received from common stock issuances to employees was primarily due to level of stock option exercises in the 2012 through 2014 period 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors cash inflows outflows from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 47 93 and 206 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively cash outflows related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards were 224 253 and 234 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2013 we paid 70 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that operates in the middle east turkey and portions of the central asia region in 2012 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of the senior fixedrate debt offerings that year which resulted in a cash outflow of 70 million

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014  in millions 



united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2014  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2014  we have no open aircraft orders 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans in july 2012 federal legislation was signed into law that allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions based on a 25year rate history in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately  217 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  1064  billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2014  we had  640  million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2014  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  136  million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

collective bargaining agreements 

status of collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 270000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” during 2014 the teamsters ratified a new national master agreement “nma” with ups that will expire on july 31 2018 the economic provisions in the nma included wage rate increases as well as increased contribution rates for healthcare and pension benefits most of these economic provisions were retroactive to august 1 2013 which was the effective date of the nma in the second quarter of 2014 we remitted 278 million for these retroactive economic benefits this payment had an immaterial impact on net income as these retroactive economic benefits had been accrued since the july 31 2013 expiration of the prior agreement 

in addition to the retroactive economic provisions of the nma there were certain changes to the delivery of healthcare benefits that were effective at various dates these changes impact approximately 36000 fulltime and 73000 parttime active employees covered by the nma and the ups freight collective bargaining agreement collectively referred to as the “nma group” as well as approximately 16000 employees covered by other collective bargaining agreements the “nonnma group” these provisions are discussed further below in the changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits section 

we have approximately 2600 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa which became amendable at the end of 2011 in february 2014 ups and the ipa requested and received mediation by the national mediation board for the ongoing contract negotiations 

our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable november 1 2013 in addition approximately 3100 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” in 2014 the iam ratified new collective bargaining agreements that will expire on july 31 2019 

multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 

changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits 

prior to ratification the nma group and nonnma group employees received their healthcare benefits through upssponsored active and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans effective june 1 2014 we ceased providing healthcare benefits to active nma group employees through these upssponsored benefit plans and the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for active employees was assumed by three separate multiemployer healthcare funds the “funds” the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for the active nonnma group employees was also assumed by the funds on various dates up to january 1 2015 depending on the ratification date of the applicable collective bargaining agreement we will make contributions to the funds based on negotiated fixed hourly or monthly contribution rates for the duration of the nma and other applicable collective bargaining agreements 

additionally the funds assumed the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the employees in the nma group who retire on or after january 1 2014 the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation for the employees in the nonnma group was assumed by the funds for employees retiring on or after january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 depending on the applicable collective bargaining agreement in exchange for the assumption of the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the nma group and nonnma group we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds in the second quarter of 2014 upssponsored health and welfare benefit plans retained responsibility for providing postretirement healthcare coverage for employees in the nma group who retired from ups prior to january 1 2014 and for employees in the nonnma group who retire from ups prior to the january 1 2014 or january 1 2015 effective date in the applicable collective bargaining agreement

accounting impact of health and welfare plan changes 

income statement impact 

we recorded a pretax charge of 1066 billion 665 million aftertax in the second quarter of 2014 for the health and welfare plan changes described above the components of this charge which was included in compensation and benefits expense in the statement of consolidated income are as follows 

 we recorded an additional pretax charge of 36 million 22 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2014 upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements covering the nonnma group related to the remeasurement and settlement of the postretirement benefit obligation associated with those employees 

balance sheet and cash flow impact 

during 2014 as part of the health and welfare plan changes described previously we transferred cash totaling 2271 billion to the funds which was accounted for as a settlement of our postretirement benefit obligations see note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements we received approximately 854 million of cash tax benefits through reduced us federal and state quarterly income tax payments in 2014 

for nma group employees who retired prior to january 1 2014 and remained with the upssponsored health and welfare plans the changes to the contributions benefits and cost sharing provisions in these plans resulted in an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation and a corresponding decrease in pretax accumulated other comprehensive income of 13 million upon ratification 

anticipated benefits of health and welfare plan changes 

we believe we have obtained several benefits as a result of these health and welfare plan changes including 

 agreement with the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund 

in the third quarter of 2012 we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan in which ups is a participant to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately 10200 ups employees represented by the teamsters the agreement reflects a decision by the new england pension funds trustees to restructure the fund through plan amendments to utilize a two pool approach which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities between two groups of beneficiaries as part of this agreement ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been a participant and reenter the new england pension funds newlyestablished pool as a new employer 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

upon ratification of the agreement by the teamsters in september 2012 we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of 2162 billion to be paid in equal monthly installments over 50 years the undiscounted withdrawal liability was calculated by independent actuaries employed by the new england pension fund in accordance with the governing plan documents and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 in the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a charge to expense to establish an 896 million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet which represents the present value of the 2162 billion future payment obligation discounted at a 425 interest rate this discount rate represents the estimated creditadjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of a similar maturity and seniority 

as part of this agreement we believe that ups the new england pension fund and our affected employees have obtained several benefits including 

 the 896 million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of 2012 is included in compensation and benefits expense in the statement of consolidated income while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the 425 discount rate while the monthly payments made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability 

our status in the newlyestablished pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for as the participation in a new multiemployer pension plan and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractuallyrequired contribution for each period and we will recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period 

rate adjustments 

in october 2014 we announced an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates that took effect december 29 2014 and impacted the following services 

 additionally the pricing change involving the application of dimensional weight pricing to all ups ground services took effect on december 29 2014 as well

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2014  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2014  because a loss is not reasonably estimable

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia americas and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st  for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2014  2013  or 2012  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2014  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

licenses with a carrying value of 5 million as of december 31 2014  are deemed to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model we incurred impairment charges on intangible assets of 13 million during 2013 while there were no impairments of any indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets in 2014 or 2012 

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 3 changes in demographic assumptions including mortality and 4 participant experience different from demographic assumptions 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate return on assets and healthcare cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2014  in millions 



 

expense is expected to increase in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine ongoing net periodic benefit cost from 524 for 2014 to 436 for 2015 these discount rates represent the combined weightedaverage discount rates for our us and international pension plans as well as our us postretirement medical plans

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2014  we had  18281 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

there were no impairment charges on our property plant and equipment during 2014  2013  and 2012  

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2014  and 2013  was  121  and  122  million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  was  143   129  and  155  million respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2014  and 2013  however we had no commodity contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2014  and 2013

we enable and are the beneficiaries of the following trends 

expansion of global trade 

transcontinental and trade across borders is predicted to grow at rates that are in excess of the growth rates of us and global gross domestic production for the foreseeable future as a result us and international economies are becoming more interconnected and dependent on foreign trade 

ups plays an important role in global trade and is well positioned to take advantage of trade growth wherever it occurs our global presence and productivity enhancing technologies allow customers to expand into new markets we advocate the expansion of free trade including the passage of regional trade pacts and the removal of trade barriers free trade is a catalyst for job creation economic growth and improved living standards additionally it propels our growth 

emerging market growth 

emerging market opportunities continue to expand over the next 15 years these markets are expected to represent nearly three quarters of global gdp growth and an increasing proportion of global trade emerging markets are understandably a focus of investment and growth for our current customers in addition they will be a source of ups’s next generation of customers to take advantage of these opportunities ups will continue to make longterm investments in markets where our customers choose to grow over the past ten years ups has established a strong market presence in three leading emerging markets china poland and turkey going forward the middle east latin america africa and eastern europe will become increasingly important for ups

competitive strengths 

our competitive strengths include 

integrated global network we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry we handle all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through a single pickup and delivery service network 

our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns 

we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

global presence ups serves more than 220  countries and territories around the world we have a presence in all of the world’s major economies

government regulation 

air operations 

the us department of transportation “dot” the federal aviation administration “faa” and the us department of homeland security through the transportation security administration “tsa” have regulatory authority over united parcel service co’s “ups airlines’” air transportation services the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended is the statutory basis for dot and faa authority and the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended is the basis for tsa aviation security authority 

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad international operating rights for us airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments ups airlines has international route operating rights granted by the dot and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network the efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on dot and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions 

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft operating procedures transportation of hazardous materials record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable faa regulations in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights involving nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation 

faa regulations mandate an aircraft corrosion control program along with aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals specified by approved programs and procedures for all aircraft our total expenditures under these programs for 2013  were not material the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition age and the enactment of additional faa regulatory requirements 

the tsa regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the tsa mission statement to “protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce” ups airlines and specified airport and offairport locations are regulated under tsa regulations applicable to the transportation of cargo in an air network in addition personnel facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with tsa regulations 

ups airlines along with a number of other domestic airlines participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program our participation in the craf program allows the us department of defense “dod” to requisition specified ups airlines widebody aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency the dod compensates us for the use of aircraft under the craf program in addition participation in craf entitles ups airlines to bid for military cargo charter operations 

ground operations 

our ground transportation of packages in the us is subject to the dot’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations safety insurance and hazardous materials we are subject to similar regulation in many nonus jurisdictions 

the postal reorganization act of 1970 created the us postal service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government and created the postal rate commission an independent agency to recommend postal rates the postal accountability and enhancement act of 2006 amended the 1970 act to give the renamed postal regulatory commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the postal service including postal rates product offerings and service standards we sometimes participate in the proceedings before the postal regulatory commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services 

customs

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220  countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

no single customer accounts for 10 or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of these large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws and regulations both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such a potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in addition our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higheryielding air products to loweryielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our network involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires and earthquakes may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 395000  employees including approximately 318000  in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and the decreasing trend of discount rates that we use to value our pension liabilities continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans the new national master agreement with the teamsters which is subject to ratification includes changes that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expenses but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or liquidity 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance increases in health care costs changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operations capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers compensation workers compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

the us economic expansion continued at a slow to moderate pace in 2013 continued growth in retail sales particularly among ecommerce retailers has provided for expansion in the overall us small package delivery market however slowing export growth and industrial production have negatively impacted the growth in commercial shipments given these trends our products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipments have experienced the strongest growth while growth in our businesstobusiness volume has remained sluggish this trend was particularly accentuated during the holiday season when strong ecommerce growth was experienced during the compressed holiday shopping period 

outside of the us economic growth has remained slow largely due to fiscal austerity measures particularly in europe this slower economic growth has created an environment in which customers are more likely to tradedown from premium express products to standard delivery products in both europe and asia additionally the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide combined with the trend towards more international trade being conducted regionally has led to shifting trade patterns and resulted in overcapacity in certain trade lanes these circumstances have led us to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to match the prevailing volume mix levels our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 

while the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in 2013 we have continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments continued deployment of technology improvements should lead to further gains in our operational efficiency improve network flexibility and capacity and enhance service reliability thus restraining cost increases and improving margins in our international package segment we have adjusted our transportation network and utilized newly expanded operating facilities to improve timeintransit for shipments in each region we have also continued to leverage the new air route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes

these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted operating expenses operating profit and operating margin in the discussion that follows 

tnt termination fee and related expenses 

on january 30 2013 the european commission issued a formal decision prohibiting our proposed acquisition of tnt express nv tnt express as a result of the prohibition by the european commission the condition of our offer requiring european union competition clearance was not fulfilled and our proposed acquisition of tnt express could not be completed given this outcome ups and tnt express entered a separate agreement to terminate the merger protocol and we withdrew our formal offer for tnt express we paid a termination fee to tnt express of €200 million 268 million under this agreement and also incurred transactionrelated expenses of 16 million during the first quarter of 2013 the combination of these items resulted in a pretax charge of 284 million 177 million aftertax which impacted our international package segment 

gain upon the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 

subsequent to the termination of the merger protocol we liquidated a foreign subsidiary that would have been used to acquire the outstanding shares of tnt express in connection with the proposed acquisition upon the liquidation of this subsidiary in the first quarter of 2013 we realized a pretax foreign currency gain of 245 million 213 million aftertax which impacted our international package segment 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charge 

in 2012 and 2011 we incurred pretax marktomarket losses of 4831 billion and 827 million respectively on a consolidated basis 3023 billion and 527 million aftertax respectively on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor no marktomarket gain or loss was incurred in 2013 as the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities only resulted in adjustments within the 10 corridor and thus only impacted accumulated other comprehensive income these marktomarket losses in 2012 and 2011 which were recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income impacted each of our three reporting segments in both years the table below indicates the amounts associated with each component of the pretax marktomarket loss as well as the weightedaverage actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit costs for each year 



the 4831 billion pretax marktomarket loss for the year ended december 31 2012 was comprised of the following components

results of operations 

bonds in 2012 financial institutions comprised a smaller portion of our corporate aa bond portfolio relative to 2011 largely due to credit downgrades of several large financial institutions in 2012 additionally credit spreads on aarated 30year bonds declined in 2012 these changes in the composition of our bond portfolio mix and the compression in credit spreads were the primary factors resulting in the 120 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate in 2012 relative to 2011 

 multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge 

in 2012 we recognized an 896 million pretax charge 559 million aftertax for the establishment of a withdrawal liability related to our withdrawal from the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan this charge was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income and impacted our us domestic package segment 

gains on real estate transactions 

in 2011 we recognized a net 33 million pretax gain 20 million aftertax on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions consisting of a 48 million pretax gain in our supply chain  freight segment and a 15 million pretax loss in our us domestic package segment the gains and losses associated with these transactions are recorded in other operating expenses in our statements of consolidated income 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses additionally these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation 

as discussed in our critical accounting policies and estimates we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 corridor immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost in our results of operations and the discussions that follow we have presented adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10 corridor this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plans in our quarterly reporting under us gaap and reflects assumptions utilizing the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost the nonadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated longterm cost of our defined benefit plans and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that can be used to better compare yeartoyear financial performance without considering the shortterm impact of changes in market interest rates equity prices and similar factors

certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activitybased costing methods these 

activitybased costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed 

to each segment changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and

revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  compared with the corresponding prior year periods 



volume 

2013  compared to 2012   

our overall volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to continued solid growth in ecommerce and overall retail sales however the increase in volume was hindered by slow overall us economic and industrial production growth businesstoconsumer shipments which represent over 40 of total us domestic package volume grew approximately 8 for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments growth accelerated during our peak holiday shipping season as businesstoconsumer volume grew over 11 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and businesstoconsumer shipments exceeded 50 of total us domestic package volume for the first time businesstobusiness volume increased slightly in 2013 largely due to increased shipping activity by the retail industry however businesstobusiness volume was negatively impacted by slowing industrial production 

among our air products volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as growth in our deferred products more than offset a small decline in our next day air services solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipping including our residential second day air package and residential next day air saver products next day air letter volume decreased approximately 7 for the year and was negatively impacted by competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry our businesstobusiness air volume continued to be impacted by sluggish economic conditions in the us low levels of inventory replenishment among our customers and changes in our customers supply chain networks the combination of these factors influenced our customers sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments and therefore the use of our premium air services 

the increase in ground volume in 2013 was primarily attributed to our traditional residential service offerings and surepost demand for these residential products continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers and other large customers businesstobusiness ground volume also showed a small increase and was positively impacted by the overall expansion of the us retail sector however continued weakness in industrial production hindered growth the increased use of omnichannel retailing including shipfromstore and shiptostore models by customers is also positively impacting volume growth for both our residential and commercial ground products 

2012  compared to 2011   

our overall volume increased in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to continued solid growth in retail ecommerce and strong customer demand for our surepost product businesstoconsumer shipments which represent slightly over 40 of total us domestic package volume grew rapidly and drove growth in both air and ground shipments however businesstobusiness volume remained relatively flat in 2012 compared with 2011 this can be attributed to multiple trends that have prevailed over the past few years including the migration of traditional retail to online retail the lack of growth in small and mediumsize enterprises and reduced business investments attributed to policy uncertainty 

among our air products next day air letter and package volume both experienced solid increases in 2012 with particular growth in our next day air saver products the higher volume for our deferred air products which increased 57 for the year was primarily due to healthy demand for our residential package services the overall growth in our air products was driven primarily by businesstoconsumer shipments from ecommerce retailers while our businesstobusiness air volume declined slightly 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

the increase in ground volume in 2012 was driven by our surepost service offering which targets lowcost nonurgent residential deliveries volume for this product grew significantly and accounted for approximately 40 of the total increase in ground shipments outside of our surepost service offering volume for our traditional ground residential services also experienced an increase in 2012 overall ground volume growth continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers while our businesstobusiness ground volume was flat in 2012 compared with 2011 

rates and product mix 

2013  compared to 2012   

overall revenue per piece was relatively flat in 2013 compared with 2012 and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on december 31 2012 we increased the base rates 65 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indices other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 

revenue per piece increased for next day air in 2013 and was positively impacted by the base rate increase and the loss of some loweryielding letter volume revenue per piece for our deferred products declined as the impact of the base rate increase was more than offset by declines in fuel surcharge rates and changes in customer and product mix revenue per piece for our air products was adversely impacted by the relatively stronger growth in our loweryielding next day air saver and deferred products compared with our premium next day air services as well as the faster growth in lighterweight businesstoconsumer shipments additionally revenue per piece was negatively affected by the faster volume growth among our larger customers which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middlemarket customers 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the base rate increase however this was partially offset by customer and product mix changes as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2013 relative to 2012 came from lighterweight shipments and larger customers fuel surcharge rate changes adversely impacted ground revenue per piece growth in 2013 compared with 2012 

2012  compared to 2011   

overall revenue per piece increased 08 in 2012 compared with 2011 and was impacted by changes in base rates product mix and fuel surcharge rates as discussed below 

revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 as declines in fuel surcharge rates and product mix changes more than offset the impact of a base rate increase that took effect in early 2012 changes in product mix negatively impacted revenue per piece for our air products as our lightweight service offerings accounted for a larger portion of our overall air volume in 2012 compared with 2011 and our next day air saver volume continued to grow at a faster rate than our premium next day air services 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a base rate increase that took effect in early 2012 however this was partially offset by product mix changes as strong volume growth in our lightweight service offerings resulted in these relatively loweryielding products accounting for a greater portion of our overall volume in 2012 compared with 2011 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 2 2012 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indices other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



in connection with our base rate increases on december 31 2012 and january 2 2012 we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 and 1 respectively each year the 2013 decreases in the air and ground fuel surcharge rates were due to the decline in jet and diesel fuel prices combined with the reductions in the index on both the air and ground surcharges these factors resulted in a 178 million decline in fuel surcharge revenue in 2013 in 2012 the reductions to the index offset the increase in jet and diesel fuel prices resulting in a small decrease in the average air fuel surcharge rate and no change in the average ground surcharge rate fuel surcharge revenue increased 54 million in 2012 primarily due to volume growth 

operating expenses 

2013  compared to 2012   

adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1147 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 this increase was primarily due to pickup and delivery costs which grew 772 million as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 290 million for the year the growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase package driver wage rates rose 22 an increase in average daily driver hours up 22 and an increase in employee pension and healthcare costs partially offsetting these cost increases was a reduction in workers compensation expense due to actuarial adjustments that were largely attributable to operational safety and claims management initiatives 

cost increases have been mitigated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency improved pickup and delivery densities particularly for our residential products have also contained increases in cost these network efficiency improvements allowed us to process increased volume up 37 at a faster rate than the increase in average daily union labor hours up 31 aircraft block hours down 06 and miles driven up 18 in 2013 compared with 2012 as a result the total adjusted cost per piece increased only 04 in 2013 

several factors caused our fourth quarter operating expenses to significantly increase adjusted operating expenses increased 553 million or 73 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the same period of 2012 higherthanplanned volume growth combined with adverse weather conditions and the relatively compressed holiday shipping season in 2013 there were six fewer days between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays in 2013 relative to 2012 resulted in a significant increase in labor hours and the greater use of contract carriers to help meet our service commitments additionally the much laterthananticipated seasonal increase in volume during the fourth quarter strained our transportation network resulting in lower productivity total union labor hours increased 62 while volume increased 56 in the fourth quarter 

2012  compared to 2011   

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 865 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this increase was primarily due to pickup and delivery costs which grew 682 million as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 238 million for the year the growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase package driver wage rates rose 20 an increase in driver hours up 11 and increased employee health care costs these increases were partially offset by reductions in indirect operating costs of 79 million in 2012 largely due to a decrease in the expense for management incentive awards 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

cost increases have been moderated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting efficiency improved delivery densities particularly for our residential products have also contained increases in cost these network improvements allowed us to process the 36 volume growth more efficiently some of the primary drivers of expense increased at a slower rate than the growth in volume including average daily direct labor hours up 11 aircraft block hours up 05 and miles driven up 13 resulting in the total cost per piece increasing only 03 

operating profit and margin 

2013  compared to 2012   

adjusted operating profit increased 71 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as the volume growth and productivity improvements discussed previously more than offset the pressure on revenue per piece and the adverse impact of fuel overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network resulting in greater productivity and better pickup and delivery density however these factors were partially offset by changes in customer and product mix which combined to pressure our revenue per piece additionally the net impact of fuel adversely affected operating profit by 158 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense 

although annual adjusted operating profit improved in 2013 it declined by 178 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 this decline in profitability was largely due to additional labor and purchased transportation costs as heavierthananticipated volume adverse weather conditions and a compressed holiday shipping season combined to result in approximately 125 to 150 million in extra costs in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition we incurred approximately 50 million in service refunds for unmet delivery commitments in the fourth quarter of 2013 the combination of these factors resulted in a 250 basis point decrease in our fourth quarter operating margin 

2012  compared to 2011   

the increase in adjusted operating profit in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely due to the revenue growth and the achievement of significant operating leverage but partially offset by the impact of having two less operating days during 2012 overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network resulting in productivity improvements and better pickup and delivery density which favorably impacted our operating margins however these trends were somewhat offset by changes in customer and product mix which combined to adversely affect our revenue per piece additionally hurricane sandy negatively impacted operating profit by approximately 75 million in 2012 

these factors drove a 40 basis point increase in our adjusted operating margin in 2012 compared with 2011 resulting in a 64 increase in adjusted operating profit

volume 

2013  compared to 2012   

our overall average daily volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to growth in key markets in europe as well as canada and mexico 

export volume increased in 2013 and was driven by europe largely in the intraeuropean trade lanes and the americas particularly in the canadatous and mexicotous trade lanes asian export volume grew at a moderate pace due to continued regional economic growth and expansion of our service offerings but was negatively impacted by fewer technology product launches from our customers and a small number of competitive losses volume continued to shift towards our standard products such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited as compared with our premium express products such as worldwide express our international customers continued to be impacted by economic pressures and changes in their supply chain networks and the combination of these factors influenced their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments 

domestic volume increased in 2013 compared to 2012 and was driven by solid volume growth in several key markets including italy canada poland and turkey 

2012  compared to 2011   

our overall average daily volume increased slightly in 2012 compared with 2011 as the worldwide economic slowdown and the associated impact on global trade restrained the growth of the international small package market 

export volume increased in 2012 compared with 2011 as growth was achieved in several key trade lanes asia to us export volume increased and was favorably impacted by new technology sector product launches from several customers intraregional export volume increased in europe and asia as more regional sourcing by customers led to growth in our transborder products us export volume declined particularly exports from the us to europe as economic weakness within the european union negatively impacted volume additionally overall export volume continued to shift towards our less premium products such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited as compared with our premium express products such as worldwide express primarily due to the impact of the weaker economic conditions on our customers internationally 

domestic volume decreased during 2012 compared with 2011 and was negatively impacted by economic weakness across europe however this was partially offset by domestic volume growth in the uk and canada 

rates and product mix 

2013  compared to 2012 

total average revenue per piece decreased 25 in 2013 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by changes in base rates customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates 

on december 31 2012 we increased the base rates 65 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing fuel surcharge indices rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

currencyadjusted export revenue per piece decreased 37 in 2013 as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was also negatively affected by the faster growth among our larger customers which tend to have a lower yield than middle market and smaller accounts additionally currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by shorter average trade lanes due to faster growth in intraregional shipments as well as a small impact on pricing from overcapacity in the asia outbound freight market 

 currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece decreased 04 in 2013 domestic revenue per piece was adversely impacted by the faster domestic volume growth in our loweryielding standard service as well as product and customer mix changes in several developed markets

results of operations 

2012  compared to 2011 

total average revenue per piece increased 15 in 2012 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by base rate increases as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates which are discussed below 

currencyadjusted export revenue per piece decreased 13 for the year as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates additionally currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by a shortening of average trade lanes as we experienced greater volume growth among our loweryielding transborder and trade direct products relative to our higheryielding transcontinental volume 

 currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece increased 38 for the year largely due to base rate increases 

on january 2 2012 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing the fuel surcharge indices rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

fuel surcharges 

in connection with our base rate increases on december 31 2012 and january 2 2012 we modified the fuel surcharges on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 in each of the two years the fuel surcharges for air products originating outside the united states are indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 135 million in 2013 largely due to declining fuel prices and the 2 reduction in the index however this was partially offset by increases in international air volume total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 11 million in 2012 due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume but was partially offset by the 2 reduction in the index 

operating expenses 

2013  compared to 2012 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 319 million in 2013 compared with 2012 this increase was driven by the cost of pickup and delivery which increased 195 million for the year largely due to higher package volume 

the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network increased 111 million for the year also largely due to higher package volume however network costs were mitigated by a 04 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network this was achieved even with a 64 increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements that occurred during 2013 

the remaining increases in adjusted operating expenses for the year were largely due to the costs of package sorting which was impacted by volume growth and indirect operating costs which were affected by increased expenses associated with aviation security 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 27 in 2013 compared with 2012 

2012  compared to 2011 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment decreased 55 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the largest component of this decrease related to the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which decreased 117 million this decrease primarily resulted from cost control initiatives including a 18 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network the cost of pickup and delivery decreased 53 million largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements and incountry cost control initiatives

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

partially offsetting these cost reductions was an increase in indirect operating costs which increased 143 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this increase was impacted by our investment in enhanced security screening for our international locations and expenses associated with business acquisition activities including our proposed acquisition of tnt express nv see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the february 2012 acquisition of kiala sa 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total cost per piece for the segment increased 23 in 2012 compared with 2011 

operating profit and margin 

2013  compared to 2012 

adjusted operating profit contracted by 08 in 2013 compared with 2012 while the adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points the solid volume growth in 2013 was largely offset by reductions in revenue per piece leading to only slight growth in revenue the net impact of fuel fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense as well as currency remeasurement and translation losses combined to decrease operating profit by 219 million when comparing 2013 with 2012 the combination of low revenue growth and the adverse impact of fuel and currency led to the reduction in adjusted operating margin 

2012  compared to 2011 

adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points in 2012 compared with 2011 as the product mix shift from our premium express products to our standard products in 2012 reduced margins in this segment additionally the volume declines in certain key transcontinental trade lanes during portions of 2012 also adversely impacted margins since these routes have a larger cost infrastructure relative to the remainder of the international package segment to support the air express volume in each region these factors were mitigated however from benefits derived from air network adjustments cost containment programs and the positive impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result we experienced a 37 decline in adjusted operating profit in 2012 compared with 2011

revenue 

2013  compared to 2012 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased 485 million in 2013 compared with 2012 forwarding revenue decreased in 2013 primarily due to lower tonnage and rates charged to our customers in our international air forwarding business the reduction in tonnage was caused by several factors including weak overall market demand competitive pressures and our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market the reduction in rates was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes particularly the asiaoutbound market revenue for our logistics products increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as we experienced solid growth in our mail services and healthcare distribution solutions however this was largely offset by revenue declines among our technology customers

freight revenue increased 242 million in 2013 driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight tonnage and average daily ltl shipments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management as well as general rate increases averaging 59 that took effect on both july 16 2012 and on june 10 2013 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by 18 million in 2013 compared with the prior year due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume in addition our truckload division experienced increased volume and revenue primarily related to our dedicated and nondedicated service offerings 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased revenue by 31 million in 2013 primarily due to growth at ups capital the ups store and ups customer solutions 

2012  compared to 2011 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased 126 million in 2012 compared with 2011 forwarding revenue decreased in 2012 primarily due to lower rates in our air forwarding business and the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rates however this was partially offset by improved tonnage in both our air and ocean forwarding businesses the reduction in rates in the air forwarding business was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes particularly the asiaoutbound market in our logistics products revenue increased in 2012 as we experienced robust growth in our mail services and health care solutions the improved revenue in our health care solutions business was driven by organic growth as well as the december 2011 acquisition of pieffe group 

freight revenue increased 77 million for the year driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight and in gross weight hauled however these factors were somewhat offset by a decline in average daily ltl shipments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management and profitable revenue growth as well as a general rate increase averaging 59 that took effect on july 16 2012 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico the decline in average daily ltl shipments in 2012 was impacted by increased competitiveness in the ltl market and the slowdown in the us economy fuel surcharge revenue increased by 16 million for 2012 compared with the prior year due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased revenue by 57 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to growth at the ups store ups customer solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

operating expenses 

2013  compared to 2012 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased 388 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to several factors purchased transportation expense declined by 236 million primarily due to lower tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business compensation and benefits expense declined by 59 million largely due to reduced payroll costs and lower expense for workers compensation claims the remaining decrease in expense resulted from lower fuel costs bad debt expense and various other items 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 234 million in 2013 while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 20 the largest component of this increase related to the cost of operating our linehaul network which grew by 62 million as a result of a 37 average daily tonnage increase coupled with wage and purchased transportation increases our truckload division experienced a 48 million increase in costs for the year largely related to the expansion of our dedicated and nondedicated services pickup and delivery costs increased 15 million as a result of higher volume and wage increases but were partially offset by productivity improvements the remaining increase in expense in 2013 was impacted by increases in pension expense and healthcare costs 

adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight decreased 4 million in 2013 compared with 2012

2012  compared to 2011 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased 97 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to several factors purchased transportation expense fell by 65 million in 2012 primarily due to lower rates charged to us by thirdparty transportation carriers though this briefly reversed in the fourth quarter compensation and benefits expense declined by 28 million in 2012 largely due to reduced payroll and lower management incentive compensation costs these factors were partially offset by a 10 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of pieffe group and the continued investment in technology and facilities in our health care logistics business 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 57 million in 2012 while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 38 for the year the largest component of this increase related to the cost of operating our linehaul network which grew by 40 million for the year primarily as a result of an increase in tonnage coupled with wage and purchased transportation increases pickup and delivery costs increased 12 million for the year largely due to the increase in tonnage as well as contractual driver wage increases of 35 rising diesel fuel prices increased the fuel expense for our fleet as well as increased the fuel surcharge rates passed to us from thirdparty transportation carriers these factors were however partially offset by productivity improvements 

adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 56 million in 2012 compared with 2011 

operating profit and margin 

2013  compared to 2012 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by 97 million in 2013 compared with 2012 this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business which resulted from competitive pressures combined with weak overall air freight market demand due to continued economic weakness in europe slowing growth in china and a sluggish us economy additionally our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors negatively impacted our results as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from thirdparty transportation carriers and thereby led to a compression in our operating margin 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 8 million in 2013 compared with 2012 as improvements in average daily ltl volume yields and productivity measures including gains in pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization more than offset an increase in wage and benefit expenses 

the combined adjusted operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 35 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and the ups store 

2012  compared to 2011 

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by 29 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business as european economic uncertainty slower growth in china and a sluggish us economy all contributed to a reduction in overall air freight market demand this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from thirdparty transportation carriers and thereby led to a decline in our operating margin operating profit for our logistics business declined in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to increased depreciation expense resulting from the continued investment in technology and facilities for our global health care business 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 20 million in 2012 compared with 2011 as gains in productivity including pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization as well as improved yields more than offset the overall decline in volume 

the combined adjusted operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 1 million in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to growth from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service

compensation and benefits 

2013  compared to 2012 

employee payroll costs increased 684 million in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases a 31 increase in average daily union labor hours and a merit salary increase for management employees however this was partially offset by an overall reduction in the number of management personnel 

adjusted benefits expense increased 498 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher pension expense increased vacation holiday and excused absence expense and higher health and welfare costs however these items were partially offset by changes in the expense associated with our selfinsurance for worker’s compensation claims these primary factors impacting expense are discussed further as follows

 2012  compared to 2011 

employee payroll costs increased 183 million in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters as well as an increase in total union labor hours however this was partially offset by a decline in management payroll costs due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense 

adjusted benefits expense increased 444 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension expense increased health and welfare costs and changes in the expense associated with our selfinsurance for workers compensation claims as follows 

 repairs and maintenance 

2013  compared to 2012   

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations these higher costs were impacted by the increase in miles driven in 2013 compared with 2012 as well as the overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package and ups freight operations 

2012  compared to 2011   

the decrease in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to lower aircraft maintenance costs which decreased 77 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this decrease resulted primarily from a 08 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours and the conversion of an engine maintenance agreement with an outside vendor from a cost reimbursement approach to a fixed rate per flight hour additionally aircraft maintenance expense declined due to a reduction in the number of scheduled maintenance checks for our airbus a300600f boeing 757200f and boeing md11f aircraft 

depreciation and amortization 

2013  compared to 2012   

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to a 62 million increase in depreciation expense on vehicles this increase was driven by the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet this increase was largely offset by several factors including lower building and facility depreciation and capitalized software amortization 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2012  compared to 2011 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher depreciation expense on vehicles of 57 million in 2012 compared with 2011 resulting from the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package operations 

purchased transportation 

2013  compared to 2012 

the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by several factors 

 2012  compared to 2011 

the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers in 2012 compared with 2011 was impacted by several factors we incurred a 187 million increase in purchased transportation expense for 2012 in our us domestic package segment primarily due to higher fees paid to the us postal service associated with the strong volume growth in our surepost product and higher rates passed to us from rail carriers this was partially offset by a 65 million decrease in expense in our freight forwarding business largely as a result of lower rates charged to us by thirdparty air carriers 

fuel 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in fuel expense in 2013 was largely due to the decline in fuel prices primarily jeta fuel prices which decreased expense by 77 million net of hedging this was partially offset by a 14 million increase in overall fuel usage which was primarily due to lower vehicle fuel efficiency and an increase in miles driven 

2012  compared to 2011 

the fuel expense increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely due to higher fuel prices which increased expense by 116 million however this was partially offset by lower usage of fuel products which decreased expense by 72 million the lower fuel usage was largely due to the decrease in total aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven 

other occupancy 

2013  compared to 2012 

the increase in other occupancy expense in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to higher snow removal costs at our operating facilities an increase in utility expenses as well as higher real estate taxes the relatively cold winter in the united states in 2013 compared with 2012 caused the increase in snow removal costs while increased usage and higher prices of natural gas and electricity resulted in the increase in utility expenses 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2012  compared to 2011 

other occupancy expense decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reductions in personal property and real estate taxes combined with a decrease in utilities expense the relatively warm winter in the united states combined with lower natural gas prices helped to reduce heating and snow removal costs in our facilities during the early months of 2012 

other expenses 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in adjusted other expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was impacted by a number of factors including decreases in bad debt expense employee expense reimbursements advertising costs telecommunications expenses and nonincome based state and local taxes these decreases in expense were partially offset by increases in auto liability insurance transportation equipment rentals and air cargo handling costs 

2012  compared to 2011 

adjusted other expenses increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in transportation equipment rentals bad debt expense and auto liability insurance as well as expenses incurred in 2012 related to the proposed tnt express nv acquisition these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employee relocation expenses and a decline in package claims expense additionally 2012 adjusted other expenses were reduced by a 9 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in our supply chain  freight segment 

investment income and interest expense 

the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions 

  



investment income 

2013  compared to 2012 

the decrease in investment income in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested assets as well as a decline in the average balance of invested assets these factors were partially offset by higher realized gains on the sales of securities in 2013 compared with 2012 

2012  compared to 2011 

the decrease in investment income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily caused by an 8 million decline in fair value adjustments and a 25 million decline in realized gains on sales of investments these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income largely due to having a higher average balance of interestearning cash and investments in our portfolio in 2012 compared with 2011 

interest expense 

2013  compared to 2012 

interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 largely due to three factors 1 having a greater proportion of our debt swapped to loweryielding variable rates 2 a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps and 3 a lower average balance of debt outstanding these factors were partially offset by the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2012  compared to 2011 

interest expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to a higher average balance of debt outstanding as well as a higher effective interest rate incurred on our debt the higher effective interest rate largely resulted from two factors 1 having a greater proportion of fixedrate debt outstanding relative to loweryielding variable rate debt and 2 an increase in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps in 2012 additionally interest expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to unfavorable fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedges as well as the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund 

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions 



2013  compared to 2012   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased to 354 in 2013 from 345 in 2012 due to a decrease in us federal and state tax credits relative to total pretax income and unfavorable changes in the proportion of our taxable income in certain us and nonus jurisdictions relative to total pretax income 

2012  compared to 2011   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the expiration of certain us tax credit provisions at the end of 2011 and a decrease in the relative benefit of other deductions and tax credits that do not increase in proportion to increases in pretax income adjusted income tax expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pretax income and the factors described above

operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2011 to 2013 time period operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2013 compared with 2012 by lower contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans however this was partially offset by certain tnt express transactionrelated charges as well as changes in income tax receivables and payables we paid a termination fee to tnt express of €200 million 268 million under the agreement to terminate the merger protocol in the first quarter of 2013 additionally the cash payments for income taxes increased in 2013 compared with 2012 and were impacted by the timing of current tax deductions 

except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension ups retirement and ups pension plans 

as of december 31 2013  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was  4665 billion  approximately 4555 of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year the amount of cash held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends however not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately 25 billion 

capital spending on aircraft over the 2011 to 2013 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing 767300erf and 747400f aircraft capital spending on vehicles increased during the 2011 to 2013 period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit due to vehicle replacements technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth capital expenditures on buildings and facilities in the 2011 to 2013 period included expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia including a 200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne germany that began in 2011 and will be completed in the first quarter of 2014 

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to real estate and aircraft sales during the 2011 through 2013 period as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2013 the net decline in finance receivables in the 2011 through 2013 period was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

the cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2011 to 2013 period was largely due to the acquisitions of pieffe group in italy 2011 kiala sa in belgium 2012 and cemelog ltd in hungary 2013 as well as other smaller acquisitions 

other investing activities are impacted by changes in our restricted cash balance the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs and the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300erf and 747400f aircraft orders in 2013 we increased the restricted cash balance associated with our selfinsurance requirements by 137 million there were no changes in restricted cash in 2012 or 2011 other than earned interest we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of 28 41 and 78 million during 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively

financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities were as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



 on february 14 2013  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  100  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2012 the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date as of december 31 2013  we had  6814  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program we anticipate repurchasing approximately 27 billion of shares in 2014  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 062 to  067  per share an 8  increase 

issuances of debt in 2013 consisted primarily of longermaturity commercial paper issuances of debt in 2012 consisted primarily of senior fixed rate note offerings totaling 175 billion the proceeds of which were used to repay the principal balance of our 175 billion notes that matured on january 15 2013 in 2011 issuances of debt consisted primarily of commercial paper and five new aircraft leases 

repayments of debt in 2013 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of the maturity of our 175 billion senior fixed rate notes that matured on january 15 2013 paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

as of december 31 2013  our 3875  senior notes with a principal balance of  10  billion due in april 2014 have been classified as a longterm liability based on our intent and ability to refinance the debt 

we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 and 2012 the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs the average commercial paper balance was 1013 billion and the average interest rate paid was 007 in 2013 962 million and 007 in 2012 respectively

cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in 2013 and 2012 

the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors cash inflows outflows from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were 93 206 and 200 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in 2013 we paid 70 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that operates in the middle east turkey and portions of the central asia region in 2012 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of the senior fixedrate debt offerings that year which resulted in a cash outflow of 70 million the remaining cash outflows in other financing activities for 2013 2012 and 2011 were related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to  100  billion under our us commercial paper program we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to € 50  billion in a variety of currencies no  amounts were outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2013  the amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in 2014  is expected to fluctuate 

we maintain two  credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of  15  billion and expires on march 28 2014  generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of 1 jpmorgan chase bank’s publicly announced prime rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3 libor for a one month interest period plus 100  plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our 1 year credit default swap spread subject to a minimum rate of 010  and a maximum rate of 075  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the prime rate is 100  below the applicable margin for libor advances but not lower than 000  we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2013  

the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of  10  billion and expires on march 29 2018  generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of 1 jpmorgan chase bank’s publicly announced prime rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3 libor for a one month interest period plus 100  plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our credit default swap spread interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect but not less than a period of one year the applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard  poor’s rating service and moody’s investors service the minimum applicable margin rates range from 0100  to 0375  and the maximum applicable margin rates range from 0750  to 1250  per annum the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the prime rate is 100  below the applicable margin for libor advances but not less than 000  we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2013  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities subject us to certain financial covenants as of december 31 2013  and for all prior periods presented we have satisfied these financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur and limit the amount of attributable debt in saleleaseback transactions to 10  of net tangible assets as of december 31 2013  10  of net tangible assets is equivalent to  2612 billion  however we have no covered saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013  in millions 



our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2013  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for technology equipment and vehicles as of december 31 2013  we have no open aircraft orders 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans in july 2012 federal legislation was signed into law that allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions based on a 25year rate history in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations as a result of this legislation we are not subject to required contributions in 2014 for our domestic pension plans the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately  235 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

as of december 31 2013  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  1023  billion issued in connection with our selfinsurance reserves and other routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2013  we had  627  million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2013  we had unfunded loan commitments totaling  153  million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

contingencies 

we are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities 

although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome we have generally denied or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny liability in all litigation pending against us including except as otherwise noted herein the matters described below and we intend to defend vigorously each case we have accrued for legal claims when and to the extent that amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims 

for those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations or liquidity for matters in this category we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss 

judicial proceedings 

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wageandhour laws at this time we do not believe that any loss associated with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc inc are defendants in a lawsuit in california superior court about the rebranding of the ups store franchises in the morgate case the plaintiffs are 1 125  individual franchisees who did not rebrand to the ups store and 2 a certified class of all franchisees who did rebrand with respect to the 125 individual franchisees described in 1 above the trial court entered judgment against a bellwether individual plaintiff which was affirmed in january 2012 in march 2013 we reached a settlement in principle with the remaining individual plaintiffs who did not rebrand we believe this settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity the trial court granted our motion for summary judgment against the certified class described in 2 above which was reversed in january 2012 we have not reached a settlement with this class of franchisees and the claims of the class remain pending 

there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the remaining aspects of this case including 1 we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and 2 it remains uncertain what evidence of damages if any plaintiffs will be able to present accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in afms llc v ups and fedex corporation a lawsuit filed in federal court in the central district of california in august 2010 the plaintiff asserts that ups and fedex violated us antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with thirdparty negotiators retained by shippers and by individually imposing policies that prevent shippers from using such negotiators ups and fedex have moved for summary judgment there has been no ruling on those motions the case does not have a trial date scheduled the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has an ongoing civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with thirdparty negotiators we are cooperating with this investigation we deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we believe that we have a number of meritorious defenses 2 the court has not ruled on the pending dispositive motions and 3 the doj investigation is pending accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

in canada four  purported classaction cases were filed against us in british columbia  2006  ontario  2007  and québec  2006  and 2013  the cases each allege inadequate disclosure concerning the existence and cost of brokerage services provided by us under applicable provincial consumer protection legislation and infringement of interest restriction provisions under the criminal code of canada the british columbia class action was declared inappropriate for certification and dismissed by the trial judge that decision was upheld by the british columbia court of appeal in march 2010  which ended the case in our favor the ontario class action was certified in september 2011  partial summary judgment was granted to us and the plaintiffs by the ontario motions court the complaint under the criminal code was dismissed no appeal is being taken from that decision the allegations of inadequate disclosure were granted and we are appealing that decision the motion to authorize the 2006  québec litigation as a class action was dismissed by the motions judge in october 2012  there was no appeal which ended that case in our favor the 2013  québec litigation also has been dismissed we deny all liability and are vigorously defending the one  outstanding case in ontario there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from this matter including 1 we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and 2 there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of this matter accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

other matters 

on march 29 2013 we entered into a nonprosecution agreement “npa” with the united states attorneys office in the northern district of california in connection with an investigation by the drug enforcement administration of shipments by illicit online pharmacies under the npa we forfeited 40 million to the government admitted to a statement of facts describing the conduct leading to the agreement and agreed to implement an online pharmacy compliance program the term of the npa is two years although we can petition the government to shorten that term in its discretion to one year the npa did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in 2013 

in august 2010  competition authorities in brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry approximately 45  freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding including ups ups scs transportes brasil sa and a former employee in brazil ups will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations in november 2012 the commerce commission of singapore initiated an investigation with respect to similar matters 

we are cooperating with each of these investigations and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we are vigorously defending each matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses 2 there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters including the calculation of any potential fine and 3 there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigations accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits either individually or in the aggregate including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 253000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” in april 2013 we reached a tentative agreement with the teamsters on two new national master agreements in the us domestic package and ups freight business units both of which are retroactive to august 1 2013 and will remain effective through july 31 2018 before expiration of the existing national master agreements the company and the teamsters agreed to extensions of both existing fiveyear national master agreements and all supplemental agreements the extensions are openended and can be terminated by either party on thirty days notice 

ups teamsterrepresented employees in the us domestic package business unit subsequently voted to approve the new national master agreement in june 2013 while several local us domestic package supplemental agreements require additional negotiation and approval before ratification occurs as of february 2014 there were a total of six supplemental agreements that still have to be approved before ratification we anticipate that the remaining agreements will be voted upon in the coming months 

the ups freight business unit ratified its national master agreement in january 2014 

we have approximately 2600  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association “ipa” which became amendable at the end of 2011  in february 2014 ups and the ipa requested mediation by the national mediation board for the ongoing contract negotiations our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable november 1 2013 in addition approximately 3100 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” our agreement with the iam runs through july 31 2014 

tax matters 

in june 2011 we received an irs revenue agent report rar covering excise taxes for tax years 2003 through 2007 in addition to the income tax matters described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements the excise tax rar proposed two alternate theories for asserting additional excise tax on transportation of property by air we disagreed with these proposed excise tax theories and related adjustments we filed protests and in the third quarter of 2011 the irs responded to our protests and forwarded the case to irs appeals 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

beginning in the third quarter of 2012 and continuing through the first quarter of 2013 we had settlement discussions with the appeals team in the first quarter of 2013 we reached settlement terms for a complete resolution of all excise tax matters and correlative income tax refund claims for the 2003 through 2007 tax years the final resolution of these matters did not materially impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 

in the third quarter of 2012 we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan in which ups is a participant to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately 10200 ups employees represented by the teamsters the agreement reflects a decision by the new england pension funds trustees to restructure the fund through plan amendments to utilize a two pool approach which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities between two groups of beneficiaries as part of this agreement ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been a participant and reenter the new england pension funds newlyestablished pool as a new employer 

upon ratification of the agreement by the teamsters in september 2012 we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of 2162 billion to be paid in equal monthly installments over 50 years the undiscounted withdrawal liability was calculated by independent actuaries employed by the new england pension fund in accordance with the governing plan documents and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 in the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a charge to expense to establish an 896 million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet which represents the present value of the 2162 billion future payment obligation discounted at a 425 interest rate this discount rate represents the estimated creditadjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of a similar maturity and seniority 

as part of this agreement we believe that ups the new england pension fund and our affected employees have obtained several benefits including 

 the 896 million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of 2012 is included in compensation and benefits expense in the statement of consolidated income while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the 425 discount rate while the monthly payments made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability 

our status in the newlyestablished pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for as the participation in a new multiemployer pension plan and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractuallyrequired contribution for each period and we will recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period

rate adjustments 

in may 2013 our ups freight unit announced a general rate increase averaging 59 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico the rate adjustment took effect on june 10 2013 and applies to minimum charge ltl and tl rates and accessorial charges 

in november 2013 we announced an average 49 net increase in base and accessorial rates that took effect december 31 2013 and impacted the following services 

 these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update to disclosure requirements for fair value measurement these amendments which became effective for us in the first quarter of 2012 result in a common definition of fair value and common measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and ifrs consequently the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the implementation of this amended accounting guidance had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income in the financial statements this update requires companies to present comprehensive income in a single statement below net income or in a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement this requirement became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2012 and we have included the required presentation in all applicable filings since that date 

in december 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that required entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to a master netting arrangement in addition the update requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements this requirement became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2013 this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we have included the required disclosures in all applicable filings since implementation 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that added an optional qualitative assessment for determining whether an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the objective of this update is to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an intangible impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of the asset this accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount we adopted this accounting standard update and applied its provisions to certain of our intangible assets for our annual impairment testing as of october 1 2012 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this update requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source eg the release due to cash flow hedges from interest rate contracts and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification eg interest income or interest expense if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety eg the net periodic pension cost companies would instead cross reference to the related note for additional information eg the pension note we adopted this accounting standard update in the first quarter of 2013 and have included the required presentation in all applicable filings since that date see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

accounting standards issued but not yet effective 

accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december 31 2013  are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2013  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2013  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight mbe  the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st  for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2013  2012  or 2011  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2013  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

licenses with a carrying value of 5 million as of december 31 2013  are deemed to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model we incurred impairment charges on intangible assets of 13 million during 2013  while there were no impairments of any indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets in 2012  or 2011  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense herein referred to as ongoing net periodic benefit cost primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate return on assets and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2013  in millions 



 

expense is expected to decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the increase in the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine ongoing net periodic benefit cost from 438 for 2013 to 527 for 2014 these discount rates represent the combined weightedaverage discount rates for our us and international pension plans as well as our us postretirement medical plans

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2013  we had  17961 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

in 2013  2012  and 2011  there were no indicators of impairment in our property plant and equipment and no impairment charges were recorded in any period 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2013  and 2012  was  122  and  127  million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was  129   155  and  147  million respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option forward and futures contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2013  and 2012  however we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months we also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions subject to foreign currency remeasurement additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was not material as of december 31 2013  and 2012

competitive strengths 

our competitive strengths include 

integrated global network we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry we handle all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through a single pickup and delivery service network 

our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns 

we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

global presence ups serves more than 220 countries and territories around the world we have a presence in all of the world’s major economies 

leadingedge technology we are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs improve service and increase efficiency

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and have spent their entire careers with us many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners

government regulation 

air operations 

the us department of transportation “dot” the federal aviation administration “faa” and the us department of homeland security through the transportation security administration “tsa” have regulatory authority over united parcel service co’s “ups airlines’” air transportation services the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended is the statutory basis for dot and faa authority and the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended is the basis for tsa aviation security authority 

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad international operating rights for us airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments ups airlines has international route operating rights granted by the dot and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network the efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on dot and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions 

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft operating procedures transportation of hazardous materials record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable faa regulations in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights involving nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation 

faa regulations mandate an aircraft corrosion control program along with aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals specified by approved programs and procedures for all aircraft our total expenditures under these programs for 2012  were not material the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition age and the enactment of additional faa regulatory requirements

ground operations 

our ground transportation of packages in the us is subject to the dot’s jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of routes and to both the dot’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of safety insurance and hazardous materials we are subject to similar regulation in many nonus jurisdictions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

changes in our relationships with our significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on us 

our top 20 customers account for less than 10 of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations however collectively some of these large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in a particular quarter or year these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular services based on factors such as new customer product launches the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business mergers and acquisitions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws and regulations both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters and our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher yielding air products to lower yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors which are beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations however changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our network involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires and earthquakes may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in a weak economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible fixed or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 399000  employees including approximately 323000  in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and the decreasing trend of discount rates in which we use to value our pension liabilities continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance increases in health care costs changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operation capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers’ compensation workers’ compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

tableend 

overview 

the us economic expansion has continued at a slowtomoderate pace through the end of 2012 continued growth in retail sales particularly among ecommerce retailers has provided for expansion in the overall us small package delivery market however recent weakness in manufacturing activity combined with the uneven nature of the overall economic recovery has negatively impacted the small package delivery market given these trends our products most aligned with businesstoconsumer shipments have experienced the strongest growth while our businesstobusiness volume continues to lag overall gdp growth 

outside of the us economic growth has slowed considerably due to volatility in world markets and fiscal austerity measures particularly in europe this slower global economic growth has created an environment in which customers are more likely to tradedown from premium express products to standard delivery products additionally the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide has led to shifting trade patterns whereby transcontinental trade is being pressured but intraregional trade is continuing to grow these circumstances have led us to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to the prevailing volume mix levels our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 

while the worldwide economic environment has been challenging in 2012 we have continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments continued deployment of technology improvements should lead to further gains in our operational efficiency flexibility and reliability thus restraining cost increases and improving margins in our international package segment we have adjusted our air network and utilized newly constructed or expanded operating facilities to improve timeintransit for shipments in each region we have also continued to optimize our aircraft network to leverage the new route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes additionally in the first quarter of 2012 we acquired kiala sa which will expand our service offerings for businesstoconsumer deliveries in europe

these items have been excluded from comparisons of adjusted operating expenses operating profit and operating margin in the discussion that follows 

defined benefit plans marktomarket charge 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred pretax marktomarket losses of 4831 billion 827 million and 112 million respectively on a consolidated basis 3023 billion 527 million and 75 million aftertax respectively on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor these marktomarket losses for 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily resulted from decreases in the discount rates used to value our projected benefit obligations in each year which more than offset the impact of the actual rate of return on plan assets exceeding the expected rate of return these losses which were recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income impacted each of our three reporting segments for 2012 2011 and 2010 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge 

in 2012 we recognized an 896 million pretax charge 559 million aftertax for the establishment of a withdrawal liability related to our withdrawal from the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan this charge was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income and impacted our us domestic package segment 

restructuring charge 

in 2010 we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization this pretax charge totaled 98 million 64 million aftertax and was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income the charge reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits and severance benefits as well as the accelerated recognition of unvested stock compensation 

gain on sales of businesses 

in 2010 we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain  freight segment and recognized a pretax gain of 71 million 44 million aftertax also in 2010 we sold a specialized transportation business in germany within our supply chain  freight segment and incurred a pretax loss on the sale of 51 million 47 million aftertax which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale the gains and losses associated with these transactions are recorded in other operating expenses in our statements of consolidated income 

gains on real estate transactions 

in 2011 we recognized a net 33 million pretax gain 20 million aftertax on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions consisting of a 48 million pretax gain in our supply chain  freight segment and a 15 million pretax loss in our us domestic package segment in 2010 we recognized a pretax gain of 109 million 61 million aftertax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment the gains and losses associated with these transactions are recorded in other operating expenses in our statements of consolidated income 

charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary 

in 2010 we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction as a result of this change in tax status we recorded a noncash charge of 76 million to income tax expense which resulted primarily from the writeoff of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status

revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  compared with the corresponding prior year periods 



volume 

2012  compared to 2011   

our overall volume increased in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to continued solid growth in retail ecommerce and strong customer demand for our lightweight products businesstoconsumer shipments which represent slightly over 40 of total us domestic package volume grew rapidly and drove growth in both air and ground shipments however businesstobusiness volume remained relatively flat in 2012 compared with 2011 this can be attributed to multiple trends that have prevailed over the past few years including the migration of traditional retail to online retail the lack of growth in small and mediumsize enterprises and reduced business investments attributed to policy uncertainty 

among our air products next day air letter and package volume both experienced solid increases in 2012 with particular growth in our next day air saver products the higher volume for our deferred air products which increased 57 for the year was primarily due to healthy demand for our residential package services the overall growth in our air products was driven primarily by businesstoconsumer shipments from ecommerce retailers while our businesstobusiness air volume declined slightly 

the increase in ground volume in 2012 was driven by our lightweight service offerings including surepost which target lowcost nonurgent residential deliveries volume for these lightweight products grew significantly and accounted for approximately 40 of the total increase in ground shipments outside of these lightweight service offerings volume for our traditional ground residential services also experienced an increase in 2012 overall ground volume growth continues to be driven by businesstoconsumer shipping activity from ecommerce retailers while our businesstobusiness ground volume was flat in 2012 compared with 2011 

2011  compared to 2010   

our overall volume increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 and was largely impacted by the slowing us economy during the first three quarters of the year businesstoconsumer shipments which represented approximately 40 of total us domestic package volume experienced stronger growth than businesstobusiness volume volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with average daily volume increasing 38 over the fourth quarter of 2010 

among our air products we experienced a 48 increase in next day and second day air package volume as a result of retail sales growth with particular growth in our next day air saver product air letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries within ground our lightweight products experienced robust growth during 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2011 volume growth accelerated to 123 and 35 in our deferred and ground products respectively compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 these increases were primarily driven by higher businesstoconsumer shipment activity during the holiday season 

rates and product mix 

2012  compared to 2011   

overall revenue per piece increased 08 in 2012 compared with 2011 and was impacted by changes in base rates product mix and fuel surcharge rates as discussed below 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 as declines in fuel surcharge rates and product mix changes more than offset the impact of a base rate increase that took effect in early 2012 changes in product mix negatively impacted revenue per piece for our air products as our lightweight service offerings accounted for a larger portion of our overall air volume in 2012 compared with 2011 and our next day air saver volume continued to grow at a faster rate than our premium next day air services 

ground revenue per piece increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a base rate increase that took effect in early 2012 however this was partially offset by product mix changes as strong volume growth in our lightweight service offerings resulted in these relatively loweryielding products accounting for a greater portion of our overall volume in 2012 compared with 2011 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 2 2012 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indices discussed further below other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 

2011  compared to 2010   

overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products during 2011 due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes which are discussed further below the overall revenue per piece increase was also positively affected by our focus on revenue management initiatives in addition the revenue per piece increase for our air products was positively impacted by the overall mix shift from letters to packages comparing the fourth quarter of 2011 with 2010 the average revenue per piece increase slowed to 34 due to the higher volume of lighterweight businesstoconsumer packages 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was also impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 3 2011 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indices discussed further below other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows 

  



in connection with our base rate increases on january 2 2012 and january 3 2011 we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 and 1 respectively each year in 2012 these index reductions offset the increase in jet and diesel fuel prices resulting in a small decrease in the average air fuel surcharge rate and no change in the average ground surcharge rate the 2011 increases in the air and ground fuel surcharge rates were due to the significant increases in jet and diesel fuel prices but partially offset by the reductions in the index on both the air and ground surcharges total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased 54 and 884 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily due to volume growth in 2012 and the higher fuel surcharge rates in 2011

operating expenses 

2012  compared to 2011   

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 865 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this increase was primarily due to pickup and delivery costs which grew 682 million as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 238 million for the year the growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase package driver wage rates rose 20 an increase in driver hours up 11 and increased employee health care costs these increases were partially offset by reductions in indirect operating costs of 79 million in 2012 largely due to a decrease in the expense for management incentive awards 

cost increases have been moderated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting efficiency improved delivery densities particularly for our residential products have also contained increases in cost these network improvements allowed us to process the 36 volume growth more efficiently some of the primary drivers of expense increased at a slower rate than the growth in volume including average daily direct labor hours up 11 aircraft block hours up 05 and miles driven up 13 resulting in the total cost per piece increasing only 03 

2011  compared to 2010   

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 975 million in 2011 compared with 2010 while the total adjusted cost per piece increased 23 for the year a large component of this increase related to the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 579 million in 2011 largely due to higher fuel costs as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses and higher rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers primarily railroads pickup and delivery costs increased 354 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a 31 union contractual driver wage increase 

cost increases were mitigated due to network efficiencies that we achieved as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and continued to utilize our expanded worldport facility to operate larger aircraft and to increase package sorting efficiency these network efficiency improvements resulted in a 08 reduction in total labor hours and a 08 reduction in miles driven in 2011 compared with 2010 increased delivery densities as a result of improved planning and technology and growth in our surepost product also contained increases in cost 

operating profit and margin 

2012  compared to 2011   

the increase in adjusted operating profit in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely due to the revenue growth and the achievement of significant operating leverage but partially offset by the impact of having two less operating days during 2012 overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network resulting in productivity improvements and better pickup and delivery density which favorably impacted our operating margins however these trends were somewhat offset by changes in customer and product mix which combined to adversely affect our revenue per piece additionally hurricane sandy negatively impacted operating profit by approximately 75 million in 2012 

these factors drove a 40 basis point increase in our adjusted operating margin in 2012 compared with 2011 resulting in the 64 increase in adjusted operating profit 

2011  compared to 2010   

higher adjusted operating profit during 2011 compared with 2010 was driven by the increased network efficiencies combined with large improvements in revenue per piece and a small increase in volume fourth quarter 2011 adjusted operating profit was particularly strong with adjusted operating margins of 152 in comparison to 126 in the fourth quarter of 2010 significant volume growth in the businesstoconsumer sector along with cost control efforts and network efficiencies were the primary factors for the fourth quarter 2011 performance

revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  compared with the corresponding prior year periods 



volume 

2012  compared to 2011   

our overall average daily volume increased slightly in 2012 compared with 2011 as the worldwide economic slowdown and the associated impact on global trade restrained the growth of the international small package market 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

export volume increased in 2012 compared with 2011 as growth was achieved in several key trade lanes asia to us export volume increased and was favorably impacted by new technology sector product launches from several customers intraregional export volume increased in europe and asia as more regional sourcing by customers led to growth in our transborder products us export volume declined particularly exports from the us to europe as economic weakness within the european union negatively impacted volume additionally overall export volume continued to shift towards our less premium products such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited as compared with our premium express products such as worldwide express primarily due to the impact of the weaker economic conditions on our customers internationally 

domestic volume decreased during 2012 compared with 2011 and was negatively impacted by economic weakness across europe however this was partially offset by domestic volume growth in the uk and canada 

2011  compared to 2010   

export volume increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to growth in key markets in europe and the americas our transborder products experienced significant volume growth particularly in key countries within europe volume for our premium worldwide express and worldwide expedited products increased as well particularly in the asiatoeurope europetoamericas and europetoasia export trade lanes additionally intraasia export volume experienced solid growth during 2011 compared with 2010 and was impacted by the continued economic growth in asia overall our export volume growth slowed in the latter half of 2011 largely due to decelerating growth in exports out of china and the rest of asia as well as difficult comparisons with a relatively strong latter half of 2010 

domestic volume increases were driven by continued growth in key markets including germany france and poland 

rates and product mix 

2012  compared to 2011 

total average revenue per piece increased 15 in 2012 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by base rate increases as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates which are discussed below 

currencyadjusted export revenue per piece decreased 13 for the year as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates additionally currencyadjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by a shortening of average trade lanes as we experienced greater volume growth among our loweryielding transborder and trade direct products relative to our higheryielding transcontinental volume 

 currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece increased 38 for the year largely due to base rate increases 

on january 2 2012 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing the fuel surcharge indices rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

2011  compared to 2010 

total average revenue per piece increased 46 for 2011 on a currencyadjusted basis and was impacted by base rate increases as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates which are discussed below 

export revenue per piece increased largely due to a combination of higher fuel surcharge rates and base rate increases which are discussed further below currencyadjusted export revenue per piece increased 30 for 2011 compared with 2010 product mix adversely impacted export revenue per piece due to robust growth among our transborder products revenue per piece was also negatively impacted as average trade lanes shortened due to volume declines in the higheryielding asiatous export lane and higher volume growth among the relatively loweryielding intraeurope and intraasia export lanes 

domestic revenue per piece increased 39 on a currencyadjusted basis for 2011 largely due to comparatively faster growth in our premium express products

results of operations 

on january 3 2011 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing the fuel surcharge indices rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

fuel surcharges 

in connection with our base rate increases on january 2 2012 and january 3 2011 we modified the fuel surcharges on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 in each of the two years the fuel surcharges for air products originating outside the united states are indexed to the does gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 11 and 449 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 

operating expenses 

2012  compared to 2011 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment decreased 55 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the largest component of this decrease related to the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network which decreased 117 million this decrease primarily resulted from cost control initiatives including a 18 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network the cost of pickup and delivery decreased 53 million largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements and incountry cost control initiatives 

partially offsetting these cost reductions was an increase in indirect operating costs which increased 143 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this increase was impacted by our investment in enhanced security screening for our international locations and expenses associated with business acquisition activities including our proposed acquisition of tnt express nv see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the february 2012 acquisition of kiala sa 

excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total cost per piece for the segment increased 23 in 2012 compared with 2011 

2011  compared to 2010 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1109 billion in 2011 compared with 2010 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in an adverse impact on operating expense comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of 198 million excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment increased 47 for the year 

the increase in adjusted operating expenses excluding the impact of currency was largely due to the increased cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network and also higher pickup and delivery costs network costs increased 745 million for the year largely due to higher fuel costs and increased block hours as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses pickup and delivery costs increased 123 million for the year primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume 

operating profit and margin 

2012  compared to 2011 

adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points in 2012 compared with 2011 as the product mix shift from our premium express products to our standard products in 2012 reduced margins in this segment additionally the volume declines in certain key transcontinental trade lanes during portions of 2012 also adversely impacted margins since these routes have a larger cost infrastructure relative to the remainder of the international package segment to support the air express volume in each region these factors were mitigated however from benefits derived from air network adjustments cost containment programs and the positive impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result we experienced a 37 decline in adjusted operating profit in 2012 compared with 2011 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2011  compared to 2010 

adjusted operating profit increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 while the segment operating margin declined for the year due to several factors the overall increase in adjusted operating profit was largely due to the volume and revenue per piece increases previously discussed however the impact of these items was largely offset by excess capacity and the adverse impact of fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements volume softness in the asiatous trade lane in the latter half of 2011 resulted in excess transportation capacity which negatively affected margins while our transportation network was being adjusted for the slowing demand fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of our hedging programs resulted in an adverse impact on operating profit comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of 123 million additionally fuel prices negatively affected the operating profit comparison between 2011 and 2010 as fuel expense increased at a faster pace than fuel surcharge revenue these factors resulted in a decrease in the operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010

revenue 

2012  compared to 2011 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased 126 million in 2012 compared with 2011 forwarding revenue decreased in 2012 primarily due to lower rates in our air forwarding business and the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rates however this was partially offset by improved tonnage in both our air and ocean forwarding businesses the reduction in rates in the air forwarding business was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes particularly the asiaoutbound market in our logistics products revenue increased in 2012 as we experienced robust growth in our mail services and health care solutions the improved revenue in our health care solutions business was driven by organic growth as well as the december 2011 acquisition of pieffe group 

freight revenue increased 77 million for the year driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight and in gross weight hauled however these factors were somewhat offset by a decline in average daily ltl shipments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management and profitable revenue growth as well as a general rate increase averaging 59 that took effect on july 16 2012 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico the decline in average daily ltl shipments in 2012 was impacted by increased competitiveness in the ltl market and the slowdown in the us economy fuel surcharge revenue increased by 16 million for 2012 compared with the prior year due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased revenue by 57 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to growth at the ups store ups customer solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

2011  compared to 2010 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased 81 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to growth in our logistics services where we experienced solid growth in our mail services retail and health care solutions forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to volume and tonnage declines in our air and ocean forwarding businesses as well as lower thirdparty transportation carrier rates the tonnage decrease was mainly the result of revenue management initiatives that improve the matching of customer pricing with market conditions as well as the impact of the global economic slowdown 

freight revenue increased 355 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to growth in ltl shipments an increase in base rates and increased fuel surcharge rates ltl shipments per day increased in 2011 largely due to improving ltl market conditions in the first half of the year and an increase in market share however volume declined in the latter half of the year and was impacted by our focus on yield management and also due to the overall ltl market being adversely impacted by the slowing economy ltl revenue per hundredweight increased primarily as a result of a base rate increase that took effect during the year negotiated increases on existing contract rates and higher fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue increased 159 million for the year driven by higher diesel fuel prices an increase in base prices took effect on august 1 2011 as our freight unit increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 69 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight experienced a 33 million increase in revenue primarily due to growth at ups capital the ups store ups customer solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

operating expenses 

2012  compared to 2011 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased 97 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to several factors purchased transportation expense fell by 65 million in 2012 primarily due to lower rates charged to us by thirdparty transportation carriers though this briefly reversed in the fourth quarter compensation and benefits expense declined by 28 million in 2012 largely due to reduced payroll and lower management incentive compensation costs these factors were partially offset by a 10 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of pieffe group and the continued investment in technology and facilities in our health care logistics business 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 57 million in 2012 while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 38 for the year the largest component of this increase related to the cost of operating our linehaul network which grew by 40 million for the year primarily as a result of an increase in tonnage coupled with wage and purchased transportation increases pickup and delivery costs increased 12 million for the year largely due to the increase in tonnage as well as contractual driver wage increases of 35 rising diesel fuel prices increased the fuel expense for our fleet as well as increased the fuel surcharge rates passed to us from thirdparty transportation carriers these factors were however partially offset by productivity improvements 

adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 56 million in 2012 compared with 2011 

2011  compared to 2010 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses were flat in 2011 compared with 2010 purchased transportation expense declined by 87 million in 2011 due to lower air freight volume as well as lower rates passed to us from thirdparty transportation carriers the reduction in thirdparty carrier rates was largely due to overcapacity in the asiatous trade lane that began in the latter half of 2010 and continued into the first half of 2011 this reduction in purchased transportation costs was offset by increases in several other expense categories including other occupancy costs depreciation and amortization repairs and maintenance and other expenses 

freight operating expenses increased 317 million for 2011 on an adjusted basis with the total cost per ltl shipment increasing 100 for the year the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network which increased 134 million in 2011 and pickup delivery and dock costs which increased 112 million for the year we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume additionally compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs and effective wage increases of 41 for drivers in our linehaul network and 35 for drivers and dock workers in our pickup and delivery network these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures including pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 

expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 6 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and the increases were spread among several operating expense categories and business units

adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by 29 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business as european economic uncertainty slower growth in china and a sluggish us economy all contributed to a reduction in overall air freight market demand this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from thirdparty transportation carriers and thereby led to a decline in our operating margin operating profit for our logistics business declined in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to increased depreciation expense resulting from the continued investment in technology and facilities for our global health care business 

adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased 20 million in 2012 compared with 2011 as gains in productivity including pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization as well as improved yields more than offset the overall decline in volume 

the combined adjusted operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 1 million in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to growth from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service

2011  compared to 2010 

the forwarding and logistics unit experienced an 80 million increase in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 largely due to revenue management initiatives and cost containment in our forwarding unit which improved operating leverage additionally excess market capacity especially in the asiatous trade lane reduced our purchased transportation costs and improved the operating profitability in this business our logistics business had a small decrease in operating profit in 2011 primarily due to our continued investment in expanding our global health care capabilities 

our freight unit had an increase of 38 million in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to increased yields volume growth and improved productivity in our operations 

the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 27 million in 2011 primarily due to improved results at our ups capital unit

compensation and benefits 

2012  compared to 2011 

employee payroll costs increased 183 million in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters as well as an increase in total union labor hours however this was partially offset by a decline in management payroll costs due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

adjusted benefits expense increased 444 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension expense increased health and welfare costs and changes in the expense associated with our selfinsurance for workers compensation claims as follows 

 2011  compared to 2010 

employee payroll costs increased 237 million in 2011 compared with 2010 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters but partially offset by a decline in union labor hours management payroll costs declined slightly primarily due to a lower management incentive award 

adjusted benefits expense increased 164 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher employee health and welfare costs and expense associated with our selfinsurance for workers compensation claims but partially offset by a decline in pension expense these factors are discussed further as follows 

 repairs and maintenance 

2012  compared to 2011   

the decrease in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to lower aircraft maintenance costs which decreased 77 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this decrease resulted primarily from a 08 reduction in average daily aircraft block hours and the conversion of an engine maintenance agreement with an outside vendor from a cost reimbursement approach to a fixed rate per flight hour additionally aircraft maintenance expense declined due to a reduction in the number of scheduled maintenance checks for our airbus a300600f boeing 757200f and boeing md11f aircraft 

2011  compared to 2010   

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to aircraft maintenance costs which increased 121 million in 2011 compared with 2010 this increase resulted from an increase in flight hours due to higher air volume additional scheduled maintenance checks and higher contractual maintenance rates the remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense primarily relates to higher maintenance costs on our office buildings and operating facilities

depreciation and amortization 

2012  compared to 2011 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher depreciation expense on vehicles of 57 million in 2012 compared with 2011 resulting from the replacement of older fullydepreciated vehicles technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our us domestic package operations 

2011  compared to 2010 

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was primarily the result of a reduction in depreciation expense on technology equipment and software this decline was primarily related to certain technology hardware and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated 

purchased transportation 

2012  compared to 2011 

the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers in 2012 compared with 2011 was impacted by several factors we incurred a 187 million increase in purchased transportation expense for 2012 in our us domestic package segment primarily due to higher fees paid to the us postal service associated with the strong volume growth in our surepost product and higher rates passed to us from rail carriers this was partially offset by a 65 million decrease in expense in our freight forwarding business largely as a result of lower rates charged to us by thirdparty air carriers 

2011  compared to 2010 

the increase in purchased transportation in 2011 was caused by a combination of higher volume as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers across all segments the combination of these factors increased expense by 387 million in 2011 additionally we incurred a 97 million increase in expense in 2011 for the use of rail carriers which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges as well as increased volumes the remaining increase in expense for 2011 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes 

fuel 

2012  compared to 2011 

the fuel expense increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely due to higher fuel prices which increased expense by 116 million however this was partially offset by lower usage of fuel products which decreased expense by 72 million the lower fuel usage was largely due to the decrease in total aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven 

2011  compared to 2010 

the increase in fuel expense in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily caused by higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline which increased expense by 982 million higher usage of these products in our operations accounted for the remaining increase in expense of 92 million in 2011 

other occupancy 

2012  compared to 2011 

other occupancy expense decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reductions in personal property and real estate taxes combined with a decrease in utilities expense the relatively warm winter in the united states combined with lower natural gas prices helped to reduce heating and snow removal costs in our facilities during the early months of 2012 

2011  compared to 2010 

other occupancy expense increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in utilities expense resulting from increased electricity costs in our facilities the remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from increased rates on warehouses

other expenses 

2012  compared to 2011 

adjusted other expenses increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in transportation equipment rentals bad debt expense and auto liability insurance as well as expenses incurred in 2012 related to the proposed tnt express nv acquisition these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employee relocation expenses and a decline in package claims expense additionally 2012 adjusted other expenses were reduced by a 9 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in our supply chain  freight segment 

2011  compared to 2010 

the increase in adjusted other expenses in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by several factors including foreign currency remeasurement losses advertising costs employee expense reimbursements equipment rentals air cargo handling costs and data processing fees these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt and employee relocation expenses 

investment income and interest expense 

the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  in millions 

  



investment income 

2012  compared to 2011 

the decrease in investment income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily caused by an 8 million decline in fair value adjustments and an 25 million decline in realized gains on sales of investments these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income largely due to having a higher average balance of interestearning cash and investments in our portfolio in 2012 compared with 2011 

2011  compared to 2010 

the increase in investment income in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by a combination of factors during 2011 we realized 20 million in net gains on the sales of auction rate securities preferred equity securities and an sp 500 index fund as well as a marktomarket gain on investments in 2010 we recorded a 21 million impairment on certain assetbacked auction rate securities which resulted from provisions that allowed the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newlyissued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value additionally in 2010 we recorded an 8 million loss on the sale of auction rate securities the remaining change in investment income was caused by a lower yield earned on our invested assets however this was largely offset by a higher average balance of interestearning investments in our portfolio 

interest expense 

2012  compared to 2011 

interest expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 largely due to a higher average balance of debt outstanding as well as a higher effective interest rate incurred on our debt the higher effective interest rate largely resulted from two factors 1 having a greater proportion of fixedrate debt outstanding relative to loweryielding variable rate debt and 2 an increase in the interest rate indices underlying our variablerate debt and swaps in 2012 additionally interest expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to unfavorable fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedges as well as the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

2011  compared to 2010 

interest expense declined slightly in 2011 due to a lower average interest rate incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps which reduced expense by 60 million for 2011 compared with 2010 however this was largely offset as a result of a higher average balance of outstanding debt in 2011 compared with 2010 

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  in millions 



2012  compared to 2011   

our adjusted effective tax rate increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the expiration of certain us tax credit provisions at the end of 2011 and a decrease in the relative benefit of other deductions and tax credits that do not increase in proportion to increases in pretax income adjusted income tax expense increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pretax income and the factors described above 

2011  compared to 2010   

adjusted income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pretax income our adjusted effective tax rate declined in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of several factors including changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances the relative proportion of taxable income in certain nonus jurisdictions and favorable developments with us state tax audit and litigation matters

operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 



 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2010 to 2012 time period operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2012 compared with 2011 by lower contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans however this was partially offset by changes in our working capital position which was impacted by overall growth in the business the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during 2010 as discussed further in the following paragraph 

except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension ups retirement and ups pension plans 

as of december 31 2012  the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was  7327 billion  approximately 4211 billion of this amount was held in european subsidiaries with the intended purpose of completing the acquisition of tnt express nv see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements excluding this portion of cash held outside the us for acquisitionrelated purposes approximately 5060 of the remaining cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year the amount of cash held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs capital expenditures share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends however not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested no accrual for taxes is provided

investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 



we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2013 will be approximately 24 billion or approximately 4 of revenue 

capital spending on aircraft over the 2010 to 2012 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing 767300erf and 747400f aircraft capital spending on vehicles increased during the 2010 to 2012 period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit due to vehicle replacements technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in 2012 due to expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia including a 200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne germany that began in 2011 and will be completed in 2013 

the proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were largely due to real estate and aircraft sales during the 2010 through 2012 period as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2010 the net decline in finance receivables in the 2010 through 2012 period is primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

the cash paid for business acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 was largely due to the acquisitions of kiala sa in belgium and pieffe group in italy respectively the cash received from business dispositions in 2010 was largely due to the sale of ups logistics technologies inc 

other investing activities are impacted by the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs and the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300erf and 747400f aircraft orders we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of 41 78 and 111 million during 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively

financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities are as follows amounts in millions except per share data 



on may 3 2012  the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  50  billion which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2008  as of december 31 2012  we had  3970  billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining on february 14 2013  the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of  100  billion which replaced the 2012 authorization this new share repurchase authorization has no expiration date we anticipate repurchasing approximately 40 billion of shares in 2013  

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 057 to  062  per share an 88  increase 

issuances of debt in 2012 consisted primarily of senior fixed rate note offerings totaling 175 billion the proceeds of which were used to repay the principal balance of our 175 billion notes that matured on january 15 2013 in 2011 issuances of debt consisted primarily of commercial paper and five new aircraft leases in 2010 issuances of debt consisted of senior fixed rate note offerings totaling 20 billion the proceeds of which were used to make discretionary contributions to upssponsored pension plans and other general corporate purposes 

repayments of debt in 2012 2011 and 2010 consisted primarily of paydowns of commercial paper early redemptions of our ups notes program and certain facilities bonds and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs the average commercial paper balance was 962 million and the average interest rate paid was 007 in 2012 849 million and 008 in 2011 respectively 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in 2012 and 2011 the cash outflows in other financing activities are largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances and premiums paid on capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2012 and 2010 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings which resulted in cash inflows outflows of 70 and 7 million respectively during 2012 the expiration and settlement of several capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares resulted in a cash inflow of 206 million in premiums while the initial premium payments for these options in 2011 resulted in a cash outflow of 200 million during that year 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to  100  billion under our us commercial paper program we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to € 10  billion in a variety of currencies 0  amounts were outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2012  the amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in 2013  is expected to fluctuate 

we maintain two  credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of  15  billion and expires on april 11 2013  generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank’s publicly announced base rate plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our 1year credit default swap spread subject to a minimum rate of 010  and a maximum rate of 075  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 100  below the applicable margin for libor advances but not lower than 000  we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2012  

the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of  10  billion and expires on april 12 2017  generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank’s publicly announced base rate plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our credit default swap spread interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect but not less than a period of one year the applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard  poor’s rating service and moody’s investors service the minimum applicable margin rates range from 0100  to 0375  and the maximum applicable margin rates range from 0750  to 1250  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 100  below the applicable margin for libor advances but not less than 000  we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2012  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities subject us to certain financial covenants as of december 31 2012  and for all prior periods presented we have satisfied these financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur and limit the amount of attributable debt in saleleaseback transactions to 10  of net tangible assets as of december 31 2012  10  of net tangible assets is equivalent to  2770 billion  however we have no covered saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding additionally we are required to maintain a minimum net worth as defined of  50  billion on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2012  our net worth as defined was equivalent to  8007 billion  we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2012  in millions 



our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2012  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts as of december 31 2012  we have firm commitments to purchase eight boeing 767300erf aircraft to be delivered in 2013 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans in july 2012 federal legislation was signed into law that allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions based on a 25year rate history in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations as a result of this legislation we are not subject to required contributions in 2013 and 2014 for our domestic pension plans the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 232 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome we have generally denied or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny liability in all litigation pending against us including except as otherwise noted herein the matters described below and we intend to defend vigorously each case we have accrued for legal claims when and to the extent that amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims 

for those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations or liquidity for matters in this category we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss 

judicial proceedings

there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from whatever remaining aspects of this case proceeds including 1 we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and 2 it remains uncertain what evidence of damages if any plaintiffs will be able to present accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we are cooperating with each of these investigations and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we are vigorously defending each matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses 2 there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters including the calculation of any potential fine and 3 there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigations accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

in january 2008  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging pricefixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services ups was not named in this case in july 2009  the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the 60  defendants named in the amended complaint the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in october 2010  which we moved to dismiss in august 2012  the court granted our motion to dismiss all claims relevant to ups in the second amended complaint with leave to amend the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in november 2012  we intend to file another motion to dismiss and to otherwise vigorously defend ourselves in this case there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 the court has dismissed the complaint once but has not considered the adequacy of the amended complaint 2 the scope and size of the proposed class is illdefined 3 there are significant legal questions about the adequacy and standing of the putative class representatives and 4 we believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits either individually or in the aggregate including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

tax matters 

 in june 2011  we received an irs revenue agent report rar covering excise taxes for tax years 2003  through 2007  in addition to the income tax matters described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements the excise tax rar proposed two alternate theories for asserting additional excise tax on transportation of property by air we disagreed with these proposed excise tax theories and related adjustments we filed protests and in the third quarter of 2011 the irs responded to our protests and forwarded the case to irs appeals 

in the third quarter of 2012  following the appeals opening conference in july 2012  we had settlement discussions which we expect will lead to a complete resolution of all excise tax matters and correlative income tax refund claims for the 2003  through 2007  tax years within the next twelve months we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 249000  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2013  we have approximately 2600  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association “ipa” which became amendable at the end of 2011  our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which runs through november 1 2013  in addition approximately 3100  of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” our agreement with the iam runs through july 31 2014  

multiemployer benefit plans 

we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 

in the third quarter of 2012 we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund a multiemployer pension plan in which ups is a participant to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately 10200 ups employees represented by the teamsters the agreement reflects a decision by the new england pension funds trustees to restructure the fund through plan amendments to utilize a two pool approach which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities between two groups of beneficiaries as part of this agreement ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been a participant and reenter the new england pension funds newlyestablished pool as a new employer 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

upon ratification of the agreement by the teamsters in september 2012 we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of 2162 billion to be paid in equal monthly installments over 50 years the undiscounted withdrawal liability was calculated by independent actuaries employed by the new england pension fund in accordance with the governing plan documents and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 in the third quarter of 2012 we recorded a charge to expense to establish an 896 million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet which represents the present value of the 2162 billion future payment obligation discounted at a 425 interest rate this discount rate represents the estimated creditadjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of a similar maturity and seniority 

as part of this agreement we believe that ups the new england pension fund and our affected employees have obtained several benefits including 

 the 896 million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of 2012 is included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statement of income while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the 425 discount rate while the monthly payments made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability 

our status in the newlyestablished pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for as the participation in a new multiemployer pension plan and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractuallyrequired contribution for each period and we will recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period 

rate adjustments 

in june 2012 our ups freight unit announced a general rate increase averaging 59 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico the rate adjustment took effect on july 16 2012 and applies to minimum charge ltl rates and accessorial charges 

in november 2012 we announced an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect december 31 2012 including the following

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update to disclosure requirements for fair value measurement these amendments which became effective for us in the first quarter of 2012 result in a common definition of fair value and common measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and ifrs consequently the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the implementation of this amended accounting guidance had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income in the financial statements this update requires companies to present comprehensive income in a single statement below net income or in a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement this requirement became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2012 and we have included the required presentation in all applicable filings since that date 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that added an optional qualitative assessment for determining whether an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the objective of this update is to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an intangible impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of the asset this accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount we adopted this accounting standard update and applied its provisions to certain of our intangible assets for our annual impairment testing as of october 1 2012 

other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

accounting standards issued but not yet effective 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this update requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source eg the release due to cash flow hedges from interest rate contracts and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification eg interest income or interest expense if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety eg the net periodic pension cost companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information eg the pension footnote this update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2013 

other accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december 31 2012  are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2012  because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight mbe  the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st  for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2012  2011  or 2010  changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2012  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

licenses with a carrying value of 5 million as of december 31 2012  are deemed to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model no impairments of indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets were recognized in 2012  2011  or 2010  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december 31st each year the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense excluding the impact of actuarial gains and losses recognized outside of the corridor as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  in millions 

  



expense is expected to increase in 2013 compared with 2012 due primarily to the decline in the discount rate used to determine expense from 558 for 2012 to 438 for 2013 this is partially offset by the contributions to the plans in 2012 that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2012  we had  17894 billion  of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

in 2012  2011  and 2010  there were no indicators of impairment in our property plant and equipment and no impairment charges were recorded in any period 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2012  and 2011  was  127  and  117  million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  was  155   147  and  199  million respectively

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as changes in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2012  and 2011  however we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

united parcel service inc and subsidiaries

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 

  



 the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates respectively was not material as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december 31 2012  and 2011

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of united parcel service inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2012  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  of the company and our report dated february 28 2013  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

emerging market growth 

as our current and prospective customers seek growth outside of developed markets they look to emerging markets for expansion we make longterm measured investments in markets where our customers choose to grow our investments are scaled to the local opportunity we typically follow a pattern of entering a market through importing and exporting expanding domestically with a partner or alliance and then ultimately acquiring domestic operations where we see value and return china is a prime example of this strategy as we continue to clear hurdles that will enable us to realize this vision our two key air hubs in shanghai and shenzhen support market expansion through increased cargo capacity and faster intraasia transit times while enabling our customers to ship later in the day we link asia to europe with overnight flights from hong kong through our air hub in cologne germany

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws and regulations both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in 

  

the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters and our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher yielding air products to lower yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us 

  

from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors which are beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make limited use of currency exchange contracts over the counter option contracts commodity forwards swaps and futures contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values but changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities in addition the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our network involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others our information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in addition breaches in security could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant 

severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our business 

severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters including storms floods fires and earthquakes may result in decreased revenues as our customers reduce their shipments or increased costs to 

  

operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in an adverse economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 398000 employees including approximately 323000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance increases in health care costs changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operation capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers’ compensation workers’ compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the slow pace of the us economic recovery in 2011 put pressure during the first three quarters of the year on volume and revenue growth in our us domestic package segment as well as us import volume in our international package and supply chain  freight segments slower growth in industrial production and the lack of significant inventory rebuilding also pressured our volume in certain industrial sectors however overall growth in retail sales particularly in ecommerce resulted in solid businesstoconsumer shipment activity during the year growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2011 due in large part to a strong holiday season for ecommerce sales which resulted in higher volume and revenue for our deferred and ground residential products 

outside of the us economic growth slowed throughout 2011 due to volatility in world markets despite this sluggish economic environment we experienced favorable volume and revenue growth for most of the year although the growth trend slowed during the latter half of 2011 

in 2011 we continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management increase operational efficiency and contain costs which led to solid improvements in operating margin and profit in our us domestic package and supply chain  freight segments during 2010 we completed the second phase of our worldport expansion which has allowed the use of larger and more fuelefficient aircraft and further improved network efficiencies we also streamlined our us domestic management structure and continued to better align our cost structure with prevailing volume levels 

in our international package segment we have continued to invest to support our growth initiatives in 2010 we opened our new intraasia air hub in shenzhen china which has allowed us to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for shipments in the region we have also continued to optimize our aircraft network to leverage the new route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes in asia we expanded our air network during 2011 by adding flights from hong kong to cologne germany adding a daily flight from chengdu china to cologne and adding new routes from japan as well as increasing our capacity to serve the south korea to us trade lane by adding a flight to and from incheon in europe we announced a 200 million expansion of our cologne hub in germany in 2011 which will increase the hub’s sorting capacity from 110000 to 190000 packages per hour when completed in 2013 in the americas we have expanded our air capacity more than 50 on 19 weekly flights into key markets in central and south america during 2011 

even though we continue to experience solid overall growth in our international package business in the latter half of 2011 we experienced weakness in the important asiatous trade lane to align our capacity and cost structure with prevailing volume levels we reduced our tonnage capacity in this lane while retaining the network enhancements and service upgrades previously implemented 

volatile fuel prices have continued to impact both revenue and expense in all three of our segments rising fuel prices have led to higher fuel surcharge rates and increased fuel and purchased transportation costs 

  

our consolidated results are presented in the table below 

 

 items affecting comparability 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 

 

 pension and postretirement benefit plans marktomarket charge 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we incurred pretax marktomarket losses on our pension and postretirement benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10 corridor of 827 112 and 16 million respectively on a consolidated basis 527 75 and 11 million aftertax respectively these marktomarket losses for 2011 2010 and 2009 primarily resulted from decreases in the discount rates used to value our projected benefit obligations in each year these charges impacted each of our three reporting segments in 2011 and 2010 and our international package segment in 2009 

restructuring charge 

in 2010 we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization this pretax charge totaled 98 million 64 million aftertax and reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits severance benefits and unvested stock compensation 

gain on sales of businesses 

in 2010 we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain  freight segment and recognized a pretax gain of 71 million 44 million aftertax also in 2010 we sold a specialized 

  

transportation business in germany within our supply chain  freight segment and incurred a pretax loss on the sale of 51 million 47 million aftertax which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale 

gains on real estate transactions 

in 2011 we recognized a net 33 million pretax gain 20 million aftertax on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions consisting of a 48 million pretax gain in our supply chain  freight segment and a 15 million pretax loss in our us domestic package segment in 2010 we recognized a pretax gain of 109 million 61 million aftertax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment 

aircraft impairment charges 

in 2009 we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc8 aircraft fleet and recorded an impairment charge of 181 million 116 million aftertax which affected our us domestic package segment this charge as well as our accounting policies pertaining to longlived assets is discussed further in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

currency remeasurement charge 

during 2009 we incurred a 77 million noncash pretax currency remeasurement charge 48 million aftertax on certain foreign currency denominated obligations 

charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary 

in 2010 we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction as a result of this change in tax status we recorded a noncash charge of 76 million to income tax expense which resulted primarily from the writeoff of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses 

  

us domestic package operations 

 

 revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 compared with the prior years 

 

 volume 

2011 compared to 2010 

our overall volume increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 and was largely impacted by the slowing us economy during the first three quarters of the year businesstoconsumer shipments which 

  

represent approximately 40 of total us domestic package volume experienced stronger growth than commercial volume volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with average daily volume increasing 38 over the fourth quarter of 2010 

among our air products we experienced a 48 increase in next day and second day air package volume as a result of retail sales growth with particular growth in our next day air saver product air letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries within ground our light weight products which target lowcost nonurgent ground residential deliveries experienced solid growth during 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2011 volume growth accelerated to 123 and 35 in our deferred and ground products respectively compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 these increases were primarily driven by higher businesstoconsumer shipment growth during the holiday season 

2010 compared to 2009 

in 2010 our overall volume increased as improvements in industrial production and retail sales increased overall demand in the us small package market among our air products next day and second day air package volume increased 21 as inventory rebuilding in the manufacturing and retailing sectors contributed to growth however our letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries the growth in ground volume was driven by increased volume from the manufacturing and retailing sectors 

rates and product mix 

2011 compared to 2010 

overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products during 2011 due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes which are discussed further below the overall revenue per piece increase was also positively affected by our focus on revenue management initiatives in addition the revenue per piece increase for our air products was positively impacted by the overall mix shift from letters to packages comparing the fourth quarter of 2011 with 2010 the average revenue per piece increase slowed to 34 due to the higher volume of lighterweight businesstoconsumer packages 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was also impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 3 2011 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground while reducing our fuel surcharge indexes discussed further below other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

2010 compared to 2009 

overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products in 2010 largely due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes which are discussed further below the revenue per piece for our air products also improved as a result of higher average package weights and the overall mix shift from letters to packages for both our air and ground products revenue per piece was negatively affected by a shift in product mix to our less premium services such as next day air saver and ground basic 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 4 2010 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

  

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy’s “doe” gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows 

 

 in connection with our base rate increase on january 3 2011 we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 and 1 respectively in connection with a base rate increase on january 4 2010 we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the 2011 and 2010 increases in the air and ground fuel surcharges were due to the significant increases in jet and diesel fuel prices each year but partially offset by the reductions in the index on the air and ground surcharges in 2011 and the index on the air surcharge in 2010 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 884 and 592 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above 

operating expenses 

2011 compared to 2010 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 975 million in 2011 compared with 2010 while the total adjusted cost per piece increased 23 for the year a large component of this increase relates to the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased 579 million in 2011 due largely to higher fuel costs as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses and higher rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers primarily railroads pickup and delivery costs increased 354 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a 31 union contractual driver wage increase 

cost increases have been mitigated due to network efficiencies that we have achieved as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and continued to utilize our expanded worldport facility to operate larger aircraft and to increase package sorting efficiency these network efficiency improvements resulted in a 08 reduction in total labor hours and a 08 reduction in miles driven in 2011 compared with 2010 increased delivery densities as a result of improved planning and technology and growth in our surepost product have also contained increases in cost 

2010 compared to 2009 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 426 million in 2010 compared with 2009 while the total adjusted cost per piece decreased 02 for the year network costs increased 167 million in 2010 due largely to higher fuel costs pickup and delivery costs increased 148 million for the year primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a 35 union contractual driver wage increase sort costs increased 59 million for the year largely due to contractual union wage increases as well as higher depreciation expense for certain operating facilities including our worldport hub 

network efficiencies were achieved in 2010 as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and increased our package sorting efficiency improved pickup and delivery densities also increased productivity in our operations these network efficiency improvements resulted in a 18 reduction in direct labor hours a 67 reduction in aircraft block hours and a 14 reduction in miles driven in 2010 compared with 2009 in addition to these factors management salary costs declined as a result of a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 

  

operating profit and margin 

2011 compared to 2010 

higher adjusted operating profit during 2011 compared with 2010 was driven by the increased network efficiencies combined with strong improvements in revenue per piece and a small increase in volume fourth quarter 2011 adjusted operating profit was particularly strong with adjusted operating margins of 152 in comparison to 126 in the fourth quarter of 2010 strong volume growth in the businesstoconsumer sector along with solid cost control and strong network efficiencies were the primary factors for the fourth quarter 2011 performance 

2010 compared to 2009 

adjusted operating profit in 2010 was positively impacted by the overall economic growth in the us which drove increased volume and yields we achieved strong operating leverage through increased network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives leading to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 

international package operations 

 

  

   

revenue 

the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 compared with the prior years 

 

 volume 

2011 compared to 2010 

export volume increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to strong growth in key markets in europe and the americas our transborder products experienced strong growth particularly in key countries within europe volume for our premium worldwide express and worldwide expedited products increased as well particularly in the asiatoeurope europetoamericas and europetoasia export trade lanes additionally intraasia export volume experienced solid growth during 2011 compared with 2010 and was impacted by the continued economic growth in asia overall our export volume growth slowed in the latter half of 2011 largely due to decelerating growth in exports out of china and the rest of asia as well as difficult comparisons with a relatively strong latter half of 2010 

nonus domestic volume increases were driven by continued strong growth in key markets including germany france and poland 

2010 compared to 2009 

export volume increased for 2010 as the worldwide economy and world trade continued to improve we experienced strong growth in asia where volume grew 28 due to a combination of regional economic growth and geographic expansion of our service offerings european export volume also had strong growth for 2010 increasing 10 compared with 2009 due to market share gains economic growth in certain key markets and an overall expansion of trade in the european union us origin export volume also had solid growth during 2010 our premium worldwide express and expedited products grew at a relatively faster rate than our standard transborder and trade direct products 

nonus domestic volume increased 152 for 2010 due in part to the acquisition of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as “unsped” in turkey in the third quarter of 2009 excluding the acquisition of unsped nonus domestic volume increased 97 led by the strength in core european markets canada and mexico

total average revenue per piece increased 46 for 2011 on a currencyadjusted basis export revenue per piece increased largely due to a combination of higher fuel surcharge rates and base rate increases which are discussed further below currencyadjusted export revenue per piece increased 30 for 2011 compared with 2010 product mix adversely impacted export revenue per piece due to strong growth among our loweryielding transborder products revenue per piece was pressured as average trade lanes shortened due to volume declines in the higheryielding asiatous export lane and higher volume growth among the relatively loweryielding intraeurope and intraasia export lanes domestic revenue per piece increased 39 on a currencyadjusted basis for 2011 largely due to comparatively faster growth in our premium express products 

  

on january 3 2011 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service while reducing fuel surcharge indexes rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

2010 compared to 2009 

export revenue per piece increased during 2010 largely due to higher fuel surcharge rates base rate increases and product mix export revenue per piece increased as higheryielding products such as worldwide express and worldwide expedited grew at a relatively faster pace in 2010 we experienced an overall lengthening of trade lanes as interregional trade increased especially in our asiatoeurope and asiatous export lanes leading to relatively stronger growth for our premium products the impact of currency net of hedging resulted in a decrease to revenue growth during the year domestic revenue per piece decreased primarily due to the impact of loweryielding domestic packages from the unsped acquisition total average revenue per piece increased 07 for the year on a currencyadjusted basis 

on january 4 2010 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market 

fuel surcharges 

in connection with our base rate increases on january 3 2011 and january 4 2010 we modified the fuel surcharges on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 in each of the two years the fuel surcharges for products originating outside the united states continue to be indexed to fuel prices in the international region where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 449 and 299 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 

operating expenses 

2011 compared to 2010 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 1109 billion in 2011 compared with 2010 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in an adverse impact on operating expense comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of 198 million excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment increased 47 for the year 

the increase in adjusted operating expenses excluding the impact of currency was largely due to the increased cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network and also higher pickup and delivery costs network costs increased 745 million for the year largely due to higher fuel costs and increased block hours as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses pickup and delivery costs increased 123 million for the year primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume 

2010 compared to 2009 

overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased 856 million in 2010 compared with 2009 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in a favorable impact on operating expense comparisons between 2010 and 2009 of 30 million excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 26 for the year 

the increase in adjusted operating expenses excluding the impact of currency was primarily due to the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network as well as pickup and delivery costs and 

  

package sort expenses network costs increased 498 million for the year due largely to higher fuel costs and increased block hours pickup and delivery costs increased 270 million for the year primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume package sorting expenses increased 61 million and were impacted by higher labor costs and increased depreciation on certain operating facilities 

operating profit and margin 

2011 compared to 2010 

adjusted operating profit increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 while the segment operating margin declined for the year due to several factors the overall increase in adjusted operating profit was largely due to the volume and revenue per piece increases previously discussed however the impact of these items was largely offset by excess capacity and the adverse impact of fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements volume softness in the asiatous trade lane in the latter half of 2011 resulted in excess transportation capacity which pressured margins while our transportation network was being adjusted for the slowing demand fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of our hedging programs resulted in an adverse impact on operating profit comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of 123 million additionally fuel prices adversely impacted the operating profit comparison between 2011 and 2010 as fuel expense increased at a faster pace than fuel surcharge revenue these factors resulted in a decrease in the operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in operating profit for 2010 was primarily driven by volume increases in all major regions and trade lanes worldwide the shift in product mix to our highermargin premium services also contributed to the increase in operating profits additionally network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives created operating leverage throughout our operations these factors led to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 

  

supply chain  freight operations 

 

  

 revenue 

2011 compared to 2010 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to growth in our logistics services where we experienced solid growth in our mail services retail and health care solutions forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to volume and tonnage declines in our air and ocean forwarding businesses as well as lower thirdparty transportation carrier rates the tonnage decrease was mainly the result of revenue management initiatives that improve the matching of customer pricing with market conditions as well as the impact of the global economic slowdown 

freight revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to growth in ltl shipments an increase in base rates and increased fuel surcharge rates ltl shipments per day increased in 2011 largely due to improving ltl market conditions in the first half of the year and an increase in market share however volume declined in the latter half of the year and was impacted by our focus on yield management and also due to the overall ltl market being adversely impacted by the slowing economy ltl revenue per hundredweight increased primarily as a result of a base rate increase that took effect during the year negotiated increases on existing contract rates and 

  

higher fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue increased 159 million for the year driven by higher diesel fuel prices an increase in base prices took effect on august 1 2011 as our freight unit increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 69 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight experienced an increase in revenue primarily due to growth at ups capital the ups store ups customer solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

2010 compared to 2009 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to growth in the demand for forwarding as a result of the continued expansion of the worldwide economy inventory rebuilding and world trade in our forwarding business both air freight and ocean freight experienced solid revenue growth due primarily to higher volumes fuel surcharges and other accessorial charges international air freight tonnage increased 19 for 2010 compared with the prior year in our logistics products we experienced growth in mail services and distribution revenue with solid increases being achieved in the health care and technology sectors 

freight revenue increased primarily due to higher fuel surcharge rates and a base rate increase that took effect in january 2010 average ltl shipments per day weight per shipment and ltl revenue per hundredweight all increased during the year largely due to our strategy of maintaining our focus on yields and targeting certain customer segments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to an increase in base prices that took effect in january 2010 as ups freight increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 57 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico an additional 59 rate increase took effect october 18 2010 additionally ltl revenue per hundredweight increased as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue increased 105 million for the year primarily resulting from higher diesel fuel prices 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight experienced an increase in revenue a primary driver of this increase was our ups customer solutions business which provides a range of services eg project management industrial engineering transportation fleet services distribution network analysis package engineering and package visibility 

operating expenses 

2011 compared to 2010 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses were flat in 2011 compared with 2010 purchased transportation expense declined by 87 million in 2011 due to lower air freight volume as well as lower rates passed to us from thirdparty transportation carriers the reduction in thirdparty carrier rates was largely due to overcapacity in the asiatous trade lane that began in the latter half of 2010 and continued into the first half of 2011 this reduction in purchased transportation costs was offset by increases in several other expense categories including other occupancy costs depreciation and amortization repairs and maintenance and other expenses 

freight operating expenses increased 317 million for 2011 on an adjusted basis with the total cost per ltl shipment increasing 100 for the year the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network which increased 134 million in 2011 and pickup delivery and dock costs which increased 112 million for the year we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume additionally compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs and effective wage increases of 41 for drivers in our linehaul network 

  

and 35 for drivers and dock workers in our pickup and delivery network these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures including pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 

expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased 6 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and the increases were spread among several operating expense categories and business units 

2010 compared to 2009 

forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased 697 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to several factors purchased transportation costs increased by 843 million in 2010 largely due to a strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses as well as rapidly escalating rates on air freight due to capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of 2010 the capacity constraints in the air freight business began to recede in the second half of 2010 and the increases in purchased transportation costs lessened cost controls partly offset the purchased transportation expense growth as total compensation and benefits expense declined 73 million and other occupancy expense declined by 23 million among other factors the decrease in compensation and benefits expense was impacted by reduced pension expense while the decline in other occupancy expense was largely due to lower rent expense on warehouses and other facilities 

freight adjusted operating expenses increased 240 million in 2010 compared with 2009 while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 88 for year the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network which increased 73 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and pickup delivery and dock costs which increased 98 million for the year we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume additionally compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs and effective wage increases of 20 for drivers in our linehaul network and 33 for drivers and dock workers in our pickup and delivery network these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures including pickup and delivery stops per hour dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 

adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased by 12 million for 2010 compared with 2009 largely due to a gain recorded in 2009 recorded as a reduction to operating expenses on the sale of substantially all our international mail boxes etc operations 

operating profit and margin 

2011 compared to 2010 

the forwarding and logistics unit experienced an 80 million increase in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 largely due to revenue management initiatives and cost containment in our forwarding unit which improved operating leverage additionally excess market capacity especially in the asiatous trade lane reduced our purchased transportation costs and improved the operating profitability in this business our logistics business had a small decrease in operating profit in 2011 primarily due to our continued investment in expanding our global health care capabilities 

our freight unit had an increase of 38 million in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to increased yields volume growth and improved productivity in our operations 

the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased 27 million in 2011 primarily due to improved results at our ups capital unit 

2010 compared to 2009 

adjusted operating profit in the forwarding and logistics units increased by 245 million in 2010 compared with 2009 as a result of several factors the operating profit increase in the forwarding unit was largely due to a 

  

strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses but was partially offset by capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of 2010 capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner resulting in a negative impact to our operating profit and margin this situation improved during the second half of 2010 as capacity constraints lessened and we were able to implement revenue management plans which better matched customer pricing with market conditions our logistics unit had a solid increase in profitability in 2010 which was driven primarily by an expansion of operating margins due to operating efficiencies and a focus on higher margin industry sectors 

adjusted operating profit for our ups freight unit increased by 25 million in 2010 compared with the prior year largely due to better productivity and increases in base pricing and volume productivity metrics increased including increases in pickup and delivery stops per hour and linehaul utilization 

all of the remaining businesses combined within this segment increased adjusted operating profit by 11 million during the year primarily due to improved results in our ups capital business unit 

operating expenses 

 

 compensation and benefits 

2011 compared to 2010 

employee payroll costs increased 237 million in 2011 compared with 2010 largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters but partially offset by a decline in union labor hours management payroll costs declined slightly primarily due to a lower management incentive award 

adjusted benefits expense increased 164 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher employee health and welfare costs and expense associated with our selfinsurance for worker’s compensation claims but partially offset by a decline in pension expense these factors are discussed further as follows 

 

   

  

 2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in adjusted compensation and benefits expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was impacted by several items payroll costs increased 416 million largely due to higher accruals for management incentive compensation plans resulting from improved company financial results union payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases these factors were partially offset by a decline in union labor hours as well as a reduction in management salary costs resulting from a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 

adjusted benefits expense increased 14 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due largely to increases in health and welfare costs and relocationrelated benefits for management employees the increase in health and welfare costs which was primarily driven by health cost inflation was somewhat mitigated by reductions in the total number of management employees and union employees covered by upssponsored health and welfare benefit plans the relocation benefit costs relate to the restructuring of our domestic package operations that occurred in the first quarter of 2010 these increases were largely offset by a reduction in pension expense due to an increase in the expected return on assets more than offsetting increasing service and interest costs the increased expected return on assets was largely due to significant contributions to companysponsored pension plans in 2010 

repairs and maintenance 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to aircraft maintenance costs which increased 121 million in 2011 compared with 2010 this increase resulted from an increase in flight hours due to higher air volume additional scheduled maintenance checks and higher contractual maintenance rates the remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense primarily relates to higher maintenance costs on our office buildings and operating facilities 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was largely due to maintenance costs on our vehicle fleet which increased by 35 million during the year the remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to higher maintenance costs on our aircraft fleet and operating facilities 

  

depreciation and amortization 

2011 compared to 2010 

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was primarily the result of a reduction in depreciation expense on technology equipment and software this decline was primarily related to certain technology hardware and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated 

2010 compared to 2009 

depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2010 primarily as a result of depreciation expense on equipment and facilities capitalized in conjunction with the recent worldport expansion amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of new intangibles recognized related to the unsped acquisition in turkey in the third quarter of 2009 as well as corporate sponsorships entered into in 2010 

purchased transportation 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in purchased transportation in 2011 was caused by a combination of higher volume as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers across all segments the combination of these factors increased expense by 387 million in 2011 additionally we incurred a 97 million increase in expense in 2011 for the use of rail carriers which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges as well as increased volumes the remaining increase in expense for 2011 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in purchased transportation in 2010 was caused by several factors including higher volume as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by thirdparty air ocean and truck carriers the combination of these factors increased expense by 1224 billion in 2010 compared with 2009 additionally the expense for the use of rail carriers increased 53 million which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges as well as increased volumes partially offsetting these increases in expense for 2010 was the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 

fuel 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in fuel expense in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily caused by higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline which increased expense by 982 million higher usage of these products in our operations accounted for the remaining increase in expense of 92 million in 2011 

2010 compared to 2009 

in 2010 higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline increased fuel expense by 564 million compared with 2009 while greater fuel usage increased expense by 43 million 

other occupancy 

2011 compared to 2010 

other occupancy expense increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in utilities expense resulting from increased electricity costs in our facilities the remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from increased rates on warehouses 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

the decrease in other occupancy expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to decreased labor and overhead expenses and lower rent expense on leased facilities 

other expenses 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in adjusted other expenses in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by several factors including foreign currency remeasurement losses advertising costs employee expense reimbursements equipment rentals air cargo handling costs and data processing fees these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt and employee relocation expenses 

2010 compared to 2009 

the decrease in adjusted other expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 was largely due to reductions in bad debt expense and foreign currency transaction expense which reflected gains during 2010 compared to losses in 2009 additionally we incurred a loss on the sale of a french repair business in 2009 additional expense reductions in 2010 were due to cost containment programs including reductions in telecom costs office supplies and outside professional fees we also incurred lower expenses associated with auto liability insurance and customer claims for lost or damaged packages 

investment income and interest expense 

the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 investment income 

the increase in investment income in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by a combination of factors during 2011 we realized 20 million in net gains on the sales of auction rate securities preferred equity securities and an sp 500 index fund as well as a marktomarket gain on investments in 2010 we recorded a 21 million impairment on certain assetbacked auction rate securities which resulted from provisions that allowed the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newlyissued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value additionally in 2010 we recorded an 8 million loss on the sale of auction rate securities the remaining change in investment income was caused by a lower yield earned on our invested assets however this was largely offset by a higher average balance of interestearning investments in our portfolio 

the decrease in investment income in 2010 was primarily due to a lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states as well as higher impairment losses on our holdings of auction rate and preferred securities 

interest expense 

interest expense declined slightly in 2011 due to a lower average interest rate incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps which reduced expense by 60 million for 2011 compared with 2010 however this was largely offset as a result of a higher average balance of outstanding debt in 2011 compared with 2010 

  

the decrease in adjusted interest expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to lower average debt balances but this was partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to the recent completion of several large construction projects including our worldport expansion 

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

adjusted income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pretax income our adjusted effective tax rate declined in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of several factors including changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances the relative proportion of taxable income in certain nonus jurisdictions and favorable developments with us state tax audit and litigation matters 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in our effective tax rate in 2010 compared with 2009 was attributable to the higher marginal tax rate applied to the gain on the sale of real estate as well as the change in the tax filing status of a german subsidiary that occurred in the first quarter of 2010 additionally we were unable to recognize the entire potential tax benefit of tax loss carryforwards generated from the sale of a supply chain  freight business in germany in the first quarter of 2010 

excluding these items our adjusted effective tax rate decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the effect of having a higher proportion of our taxable income in 2010 being subject to tax outside the united states where statutory tax rates are generally lower 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

the following is a summary of the significant sources uses of cash from operating activities amounts in millions 

 

  

 cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2009 to 2011 time period operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2011 compared with 2010 by higher net income changes in our working capital position the timing of income tax payments and the amount of contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans the favorable changes in working capital were impacted by the change in the timing of the elective awards under our management incentive awards program which shifted the payout of 253 million in awards from 2011 to the first quarter of 2012 the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during 2010 as discussed further in the following paragraph 

except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 

 

  

  

  

 as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension ups retirement and ups pension plans 

  

investing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions 

 

 we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations capital spending increased in 2011 to support several growth initiatives in 2010 and 2009 we had reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our operating needs in the economic environment at that time future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately 22 billion or approximately 4 of revenue 

capital spending on aircraft over the 2009 to 2011 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing 767300 and 747400 aircraft capital spending on vehicles increased during 2010 and 2011 in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit due to vehicle replacements technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth 

capital expenditures on buildings and facilities declined over the 2009 through 2011 period primarily resulting from the completion of several large hub construction and expansion projects including our worldport hub expansion in 2009 we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion which increased the sorting capacity by 15 the final phase of the worldport expansion was completed in 2010 with an additional sorting capacity of approximately 20 we anticipate that capital spending on buildings and facilities will increase in 2012 due to expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia including a 200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne germany during 2012 and 2013 

the 2010 increase in proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment is largely due to real estate sales and the proceeds from insurance recoveries the net decline in finance receivables in the 2009 through 2011 period is primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

the cash paid for business acquisitions in 2011 was largely due to the acquisition of pieffe group in italy the cash received from business dispositions in 2010 was largely due to the sale of ups logistics technologies inc in 2009 the cash outflow for the purchase of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as was largely offset by the cash received from the sale of the international franchise operations of our mail boxes etc unit 

  

other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300 and boeing 747400 aircraft orders and the equity investments in five new leveraged aircraft leases we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of 78 111 and 117 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

financing activities 

our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities are as follows amounts in millions except per share data 

 

 in january 2008 the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 100 billion share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions as a result of the uncertain economic environment in 2010 and 2009 we slowed our share repurchase activity and repurchased shares at a rate that approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program as of december 31 2011 we had 2525 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining in 2012 pending board of directors approval of an additional share repurchase authorization we anticipate repurchasing approximately 27 billion in shares 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2012 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 052 to 057 per share a 10 increase 

issuances of debt in 2011 consisted primarily of commercial paper and five new aircraft leases in 2010 and 2009 we completed senior fixed rate note offerings of 20 billion in each year these note offerings were used for various purposes including discretionary contributions to upssponsored pension plans the retirement of existing debt instruments and other general corporate purposes 

  

repayments of debt in 2011 2010 and 2009 consisted primarily of paydowns of commercial paper early redemptions of our ups notes program and certain facilities bonds and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2011 and 341 million outstanding at december 31 2010 the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs the average commercial paper balance was 849 million and the average interest rate paid was 008 in 2011 947 million and 014 in 2010 respectively 

cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in 2011 and 2010 the cash outflows in other financing activities are largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances and premiums paid on capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2010 and 2009 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings which resulted in cash inflows outflows of 7 and 243 million respectively as of december 31 2011 we had paid premiums of 200 million on capped call options for the purchase of 33 million class b shares that will settle in the first half of 2012 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to 100 billion under our us commercial paper program as of december 31 2011 we had no commercial paper outstanding the amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2012 is expected to fluctuate we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december 31 2011 

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of 15 billion and expires on april 12 2012 generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank’s publicly announced base rate plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our 1year credit default swap spread subject to a minimum rate of 015 and a maximum rate of 075 the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 100 below the applicable margin for libor advances but not lower than 000 we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2011 

the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of 10 billion and expires on april 14 2015 generally amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination plus an applicable margin alternatively a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank’s publicly announced base rate plus an applicable margin may be used at our discretion in each case the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our credit default swap spread interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect but not less than a period of one year the applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard  poor’s rating service and moody’s investors service the minimum applicable margin rates range from 0250 to 0500 and the maximum applicable margin rates range from 1000 to 1500 the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 100 below the applicable margin for libor advances but not less than 000 we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2011 

  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants as of december 31 2011 and for all prior periods presented we have satisfied these financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur and limit the amount of attributable debt in saleleaseback transactions to 10 of net tangible assets as of december 31 2011 10 of net tangible assets is equivalent to 2550 billion however we have no covered saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding additionally we are required to maintain a minimum net worth as defined of 50 billion on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2011 our net worth as defined was equivalent to 10138 billion we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011 in millions 

 

 our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2011 the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts as of december 31 2011 we have firm commitments to purchase 15 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2012 and 2013 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for anticipated future growth 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified pension plans these contributions include those to the ups ibt pension plan the ups pension plan and the ups retirement plan these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our 

  

current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above additionally we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond 2017 because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 

we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in 2012 in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 

as discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 252 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 1551 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2011 we had 583 million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2011 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 248 million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

contingencies 

we are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities 

although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome we have generally denied or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny liability in all litigation pending against us including the matters described below and we intend to defend vigorously each case we have accrued for legal claims when and to the extent that amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims 

for those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations or liquidity for matters in this category we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss 

judicial proceedings 

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wageandhour laws at this time we do not believe that any loss associated with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc inc are defendants in two lawsuits about the rebranding or purchase of the ups store franchises—morgate and samica we prevailed at the trial court level in both cases 

  

and plaintiffs appealed morgate was filed in march 2003 the plaintiffs are 125 individual franchisees who did not rebrand and a certified class of all franchisees who did rebrand to the ups store a bellwether trial for three individual plaintiffs was set for early 2010 but the trial court entered judgment against one of the three plaintiffs prior to trial which was affirmed in january 2012 the trial court also granted our motion for summary judgment against the members of the certified class which was reversed in january 2012 the remainder of the case has been stayed pending appeal samica was filed in march 2006 the plaintiffs are 250 individual the ups store franchisees who either elected to rebrand or purchased new the ups store franchises summary judgment was granted in ups’s favor and affirmed on appeal in december 2011 there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 three separate components of these cases are being appealed to federal and state courts following decisions favorable to ups and we cannot predict the final outcomes of these appeals and 2 it remains uncertain what evidence of damages if any plaintiffs will be able to present if any aspects of these cases proceed forward accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in barber auto sales v ups which a federal court in alabama certified as a class action in september 2009 the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from ups’s assessment of shipping charge corrections when ups determines that the “dimensional weight” of packages is greater than that reported by the shipper on june 1 2011 we reached an agreement in principle to settle the case for an immaterial amount the settlement has been preliminarily approved and remains subject to a final fairness hearing 

in afms llc v ups and fedex corporation a lawsuit filed in federal court in the central district of california in august 2010 the plaintiff asserts that ups and fedex violated us antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third party negotiators retained by shippers andor to monopolize a socalled market for shipping consultation services the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has informed us that it has opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third party negotiators we are cooperating with this investigation we deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we believe that we have a number of meritorious defenses 2 afms has not articulated any measure of damages and 3 the doj investigation is ongoing accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in canada three purported classaction cases were filed against us in british columbia 2006 ontario 2007 and québec 2006 the cases each allege inadequate disclosure concerning the existence and cost of brokerage services provided by us under applicable provincial consumer protection legislation and infringement of interest restriction provisions under the criminal code of canada the british columbia classaction was declared inappropriate for certification and dismissed by the trial judge that decision was upheld by the british columbia court of appeal in march 2010 which ended the case in our favor the ontario class action was certified in september 2011 partial summary judgment was granted to us and the plaintiffs by the ontario motions court the complaint under the criminal code was dismissed no appeal is being taken from that decision the allegations of inadequate disclosure were granted and we are appealing that decision the request to certify the case in québec will be heard in february 2012 we have denied all liability and are vigorously defending the two outstanding cases there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and 2 there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of these matters accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation or liquidity 

  

other matters 

in may and december 2007 and august 2008 we received and responded to grand jury subpoenas from the doj in the northern district of california in connection with an investigation by the drug enforcement administration we also have responded to informal requests for information in connection with this investigation which relates to transportation of packages on behalf of online pharmacies that may have operated illegally we are cooperating with this investigation and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from this matter including 1 we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and 2 there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of this matter accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj regarding the doj’s investigation into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december 2007 

in october 2007 june 2008 and february 2009 we received information requests from the european commission “commission” relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry and subsequently responded to each request in february 2010 ups received a statement of objections by the commission this document contains the commission’s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by 18 freight forwarders including ups although it alleges anticompetitive behavior it does not prejudge the commission’s final decision as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts the options available to the commission include taking no action or imposing a monetary fine the range of any potential action by the commission is not reasonably estimable any decision imposing a fine would be subject to appeal ups has responded to the statement of objections including at a july 2010 commission hearing and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding we received additional information requests from the commission in january and july 2011 and we have responded to those requests 

in august 2010 competition authorities in brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry approximately 45 freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding including ups ups scs transportes brasil sa and a former employee in brazil ups will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations 

we are cooperating with each of these investigations and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we are vigorously defending each matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses 2 there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters including the calculation of any potential fine and 3 there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigations accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in january 2008 a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging pricefixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services ups was not named in this case in july 2009 the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the 60 defendants named in the amended complaint we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant our motion to dismiss with leave to amend and the scope of the plaintiffs’ claims is therefore unclear 2 the scope and size of the proposed class is 

  

illdefined 3 there are significant legal questions about the adequacy and standing of the putative class representatives and 4 we believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits either individually or in the aggregate including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in june 2011 we received internal revenue service “irs” reports covering income taxes and excise taxes for tax years 2005 through 2007 and 2003 through 2007 respectively the reports propose assessments related to amounts paid for software research credit expenditures and deductibility of financing and postacquisition integration costs as well as taxes on amounts paid for air transportation receipt of the reports represents only the conclusion of the examination process we disagree with the proposed assessments related to these matters therefore we have filed protests and protective tax refund claims during the third quarter of 2011 the irs responded to our protests and forwarded the cases to irs appeals there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from these matters including 1 we are vigorously defending these matters and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses 2 we have filed refund claims in excess of the proposed assessments 3 there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters including the calculation of any additional taxes andor tax refunds and 4 these matters are at the initial stage of a multilevel administrative appeals process that may ultimately be resolved by litigation accordingly at this time we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

collective bargaining agreements 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 245000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters these agreements run through july 31 2013 we have approximately 2700 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the ipa which became amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which runs through november 1 2013 in addition approximately 3200 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the iam our agreement with the iam runs through july 31 2014 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in and we are in compliance with these contribution rates these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 

rate adjustments 

in november 2011 we announced an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect january 2 2012 ups ground service rates increased a net 49 through a combination of a 59 increase in rates and a 1 reduction in the index used to determine the ground fuel surcharge ups next day air ups 2 nd day air ups 3 day select and international air shipments originating in the united states including worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased a net 49 through a combination of a 69 increase in base rates and 

  

a 2 reduction in the index used to determine the air fuel surcharge these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update regarding disclosure of an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans this new guidance requires companies to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financial obligations risks and commitments as well as the level of participation in multiemployer plans companies are required to disclose detailed information about significant multiemployer plans including contributions made to the plans financial health and funded status of the plans and expiration of the collectivebargaining agreements that require contributions to the plans this accounting standards update impacted our disclosures only and did not have any impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity the disclosures required by this accounting standards update are presented in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that amends the accounting guidance on goodwill impairment testing this accounting standards update is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit this accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we adopted this accounting standards update and applied its provisions to certain of our reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 2011 

other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

accounting standards issued but not yet effective 

accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december 31 2011 are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

  

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and selfinsurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position as of december 31 2011 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2011 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight mbe  the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit then we utilize a twostep process to test goodwill for impairment first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2011 2010 or 2009 changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge as of our october 1 2011 goodwill impairment testing date our ups freight reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 the fair value of this reporting unit was negatively impacted in 2011 by the difficult market environment for the ltl industry resulting in reduced equity valuations for market comparable companies several factors including lower than expected revenues andor operating margins an increased cost of capital and higher than anticipated capital expenditure requirements could result in the reporting unit’s fair value declining below its carrying value in a future period additionally a sustained decline in the valuations of publiclytraded comparable companies in the ltl industry would also reduce the calculated fair value of this reporting unit our ups freight reporting unit has a total goodwill balance of 441 million as of december 31 2011 a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our other reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2011 would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

  

licenses with a carrying value of 5 million as of december 31 2011 are deemed to be indefinitelived intangibles and therefore are not amortized impairment tests for indefinitelived intangibles are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model no impairments of indefinitelived or finitelived intangible assets were recognized in 2011 2010 or 2009 

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

  

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates and we believe that they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 

differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we elected to change our accounting methodologies for recognizing expense for our companysponsored us and international pension and other postretirement benefit plans previously net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligations the “corridor” were recognized over the average remaining service life of employees in each respective plan further for our largest pension plan the ups retirement plan we used a calculated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a fiveyear period 

under our new accounting methods we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year these new accounting methods result in changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses being recognized in expense faster than our previous amortization method the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets will be recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense herein referred to as “ongoing expense” or “ongoing net periodic benefit cost” 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and ongoing expense as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 in millions 

 

   

ongoing expense will increase in 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to the decline in the us discount rate used to determine expense from 595 for 2011 to 561 for 2012 this is partially offset by the contributions to the plans in 2011 that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2011 we had 17621 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

in 2011 and 2010 there were no indicators of impairment in our aircraft fleet and no impairment charges were recorded in either period in 2009 we recorded a 181 million impairment charge as described in the following paragraphs 

in 2008 we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl’s express deferred and international package volume within the united states as well as air transportation services between the united states canada and mexico in early april 2009 ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services additionally our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services as a result of these factors the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 

based on the factors noted above as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc871 and dc873 aircraft fleets we conducted an impairment analysis as of march 31 2009 and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft based on anticipated residual values for the airframes engines and parts we recognized an impairment charge of 181 million in the first quarter of 2009 the dc8 fleets were subsequently retired from service 

  

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2011 and 2010 was 117 and 127 million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 147 199 and 254 million respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2011 and 2010 however we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and 

  

commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 

 

  

  the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates respectively was not material as of december 31 2011 or 2010 the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december 31 2011 or 2010

we believe that our integrated global network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through one integrated pickup and delivery service system all packages are commingled throughout their journey through our network except when necessary to meet their specific service commitments 

us domestic package 

the us business consists of air and ground delivery of small packages—up to 150 pounds in weight—and letters to and from all 50 states it also provides guaranteed timedefinite delivery of certain heavyweight packages substantially all of our us small package delivery services are guaranteed 

the integrated air and ground pickup and delivery network on which this business is built improves productivity and asset utilization and provides the flexibility to transport packages using the most reliable and costeffective transportation mode or combination of modes 

in 2010 ups completed the second phase of a multiyear expansion of the fully automated worldport ® air hub in louisville ky our largest air hub worldport ® sort capacity has been expanded to 416000 packages per hour—a 37 increase this expansion enables more costeffective package processing and enables the use of larger more fuel efficient aircraft 

during the first quarter of 2010 ups completed a restructuring of its us package operations with this new structure we now have the opportunity to better deliver the value our solutions bring to small and mediumsized customers 

in 2009 we expanded our early morning delivery service ups now delivers earlier to more businesses and zip codes in the united states and earlier to more countries from the united states than our competitors 

we believe that our broad product portfolio reliable package delivery service experienced and dedicated employees and unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling services to our large and diverse customer base to control costs through effective network modification and limited expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

international package

 growth in asia is being driven by global demand which is stimulating improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region particularly in china over the last few years ups has steadily increased air service between the us and asia 

 

  

  

 the international package delivery market has been growing at a faster rate than that of the us and our international package operations have historically been growing faster than the market we plan to use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services additionally we plan to expand our nonus domestic package operations by continuing to build our package delivery infrastructure and through acquisitions in certain countries we have been and will continue to implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations we believe that both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for longterm growth 

supply chain  freight 

the supply chain  freight segment consists of our forwarding and logistics capabilities as well as our ups freight business unit 

  

supply chains are becoming increasingly complex many of our customers large and small have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to improve service to support new business models and to strengthen their balance sheets 

this increasing complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade and brokerage services with financial and information services we can meet that demand because 

 

  

  

  

 ups freight is an ltl service which offers a full range of regional interregional and longhaul ltl capabilities in all 50 states canada puerto rico guam the virgin islands and mexico this business also offers a tl service ups freight provides services through a network of owned and leased service centers and carrier partnerships

technology 

technology is the backbone of everything we do at ups it is at the heart of customer access to our company 

 

   

  

 technology is also the foundation for process improvements within ups that enhance productivity improve efficiency and reduce costs in recent years we completed the most comprehensive improvement to our us small package handling facilities this multiyear effort reengineered our domestic business based on a datadriven platform and included software hardware and process changes it enables a package center to produce an optimized dispatch plan for every driver and detailed loading instructions for every vehicle before center employees handle any packages this plan reduces mileage driven resulting in substantial fuel savings the reengineered system provides the basis for unique customerfocused services based on the customerspecific data which powers the system 

a new technology we began deploying in 2008 is telematics which combines information from our drivers’ handheld computers with gps and automotive sensors to help us better manage our ground fleet operations it helps us improve vehicle maintenance enhance safety and finetune delivery and pickup service this technology also improves onroad performance by reducing vehicle expense fuel consumption and carbon emissions since 2008 we have equipped approximately 24000 of our us vehicles with the sensors needed to achieve the benefits from this technology

our business strategy and corporate responsibility strategy are substantially the same to increase the economic vitality and environmental sustainability of the global economy by aggregating the shipping activity of millions of businesses and individuals worldwide into a single highly efficient logistics network the website wwwsustainabilityupscom provides complete information on this strategy this approach 

 

  

  

 we continually strive to improve our efficiencies and reduce the overall energy and emissions intensity of our global distribution network 

at ups we recognize our management approach for avoiding energy use and emissions as “decarbonization synergy” this means we simultaneously pursue multiple strategies for carbon avoidance in a way that makes each one stronger and more effective than it would be on its own a simple yet powerful example of decarbonization synergy at ups is our ability to handle all categories of service express ground domestic international commercial residential through one integrated pickup and delivery service system we believe our integrated network is a competitive advantage therefore we are able to use all assets more efficiently and achieve far greater carbon avoidance

competition 

we are the largest package delivery company in the world in terms of both revenue and volume we offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and therefore compete with many different local regional national and international companies our competitors include worldwide postal services various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others through our supply chain service offerings we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain financial services and information technology industries 

competitive strengths 

our competitive strengths include 

integrated global network we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through a single pickup and delivery service system 

our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns 

we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

global presence ups serves more than 220 countries and territories around the world we have a presence in all of the major economies and are among the leaders in most of them 

leadingedge technology we are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs improve service and increase efficiency 

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to conveniently send manage and track their shipments but also to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own web sites

customer relationships we focus on building and maintaining longterm customer relationships we serve 11 million pickup customers and 74 million delivery customers daily crossselling small package supply chain and freight services across our customer base is an important growth mechanism for ups 

brand equity we have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service reliability and product innovation the distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity 

distinctive culture we believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive “employeeowner” concept our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927 when our 

  

founders who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business first offered stock to employees to facilitate employee stock ownership we maintain several stockbased compensation programs 

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and have spent their entire careers with us many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners

government regulation 

air operations 

the us department of transportation “dot” the federal aviation administration “faa” and the us department of homeland security through the transportation security administration “tsa” have regulatory authority over united parcel service co’s “ups airlines’” air transportation services the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended is the statutory basis for dot and faa authority and the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended is the basis for tsa aviation security authority 

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad international operating rights for us airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments ups airlines has international route operating rights granted by the dot and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network the efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on dot and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions 

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft operating procedures transportation of hazardous materials record keeping standards and maintenance activities personnel and ground facilities in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable faa regulations in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights involving nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation

risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well as the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity to the extent that the recovery from the recent recession in the us and in other countries takes longer than anticipated our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected 

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws and regulations both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes and other restrictions and charges changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in 

  

the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or trucks prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results notwithstanding our widely recognized position as a leader in sustainable business practices it is reasonably possible however that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher yielding air products to lower yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us 

  

from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors which are beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound and canadian dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make limited use of currency exchange contracts over the counter option contracts commodity forwards swaps and futures contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values but changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempts to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data security 

the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our network involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others breaches in security could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation or disruptions in our operations in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

we have invested in a technology infrastructure which supports our global air and ground network and is critical to support our operations and customer needs any major disruption to this infrastructure could adversely impact our operations customers and global commerce 

our ability to serve customers and to compete effectively depends to a large part upon the reliability and speed of our technology network while we have built a multilayered architecture to support swiftlyexpanding worldwide operations and we ensure that our infrastructure is robust reliable and redundant there are risks of malicious or unintentional disruptions to the internet or our technology infrastructure which could adversely impact our operations and consequently our customers and global commerce 

  

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in an adverse economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment writedowns of our intangible or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 400600 employees including approximately 330600 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing health care costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance increases in health care costs changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operation capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers’ compensation workers’ compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our us domestic package international package and supply chain  freight segments were all positively affected by the worldwide economic recovery in 2010 our operating results had deteriorated in 2008 and 2009 due to the severity and length of the economic recession growth in world trade us industrial production and retail sales positively impacted volume in our package delivery ltl and forwarding operations in 2010 additionally cost containment initiatives and better network efficiencies resulted in improving operating profit margins for our small package operations our consolidated results are presented in the table below 

 

 items affecting comparability 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions 

 

 restructuring charge 

in 2010 we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization this pretax charge totaled 98 million 64 million aftertax and reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits severance benefits and unvested stock compensation 

  

gain on sales of businesses 

in 2010 we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain  freight segment and recognized a pretax gain of 71 million 44 million aftertax also in 2010 we sold a specialized transportation business in germany within our supply chain  freight segment and incurred a pretax loss on the sale of 51 million 47 million aftertax which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale 

gain on sale of real estate 

in 2010 we recognized a pretax gain of 109 million 61 million aftertax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment 

aircraft impairment charges 

in 2009 we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc8 aircraft fleet and recorded an impairment charge of 181 million which affected our us domestic package segment this charge as well as our accounting policies pertaining to longlived assets is discussed further in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

goodwill impairment charge 

in 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this charge as well as our accounting policies pertaining to goodwill is discussed further in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

intangible impairment charge 

in 2008 we completed an impairment assessment on a customer list intangible asset related to our domestic package entity in the united kingdom we recorded a 27 million charge related to this assessment which is further discussed in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

currency remeasurement charge 

during 2009 we incurred a 77 million noncash pretax currency remeasurement charge on certain foreign currency denominated obligations 

charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary 

in 2010 we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction as a result of this change in tax status we recorded a noncash charge of 76 million to income tax expense which resulted primarily from the writeoff of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for 

  

future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses 

us domestic package operations 

 

 volume 

2010 compared to 2009 

in 2010 our overall volume increased as improvements in industrial production and retail sales increased overall demand in the us small package market among our air products package volume increased as inventory rebuilding in the manufacturing and retailing sectors contributed to growth however our letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries the growth in ground volume was driven by increased volume from the manufacturing and retailing sectors 

2009 compared to 2008 

in 2009 our overall volume declined as decreases in industrial production and retail sales reduced overall demand in the us small package market our air product volume was stronger than our ground volume as our air volume benefited from market share gains resulting from the departure of a competitor in the us market as well as improving economic trends in the latter half of the year the growth in air volume was strongest in our less timesensitive products such as next day air saver and three day select 

  

volume trends improved in the fourth quarter largely as a result of overall economic improvements as average daily volume for next day air and deferred products increased 28 and 43 respectively over 2008 levels ground volume demonstrated an improving trend over the previous quarters despite a 29 decline in the fourth quarter compared with 2008 

revenue per piece 

2010 compared to 2009 

overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products in 2010 largely due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes which are discussed further below the revenue per piece for our air products also improved as a result of higher average package weights and the overall mix shift from letters to packages for both our air and ground products revenue per piece was negatively affected by a shift in product mix to our less premium services such as next day air saver and ground basic 

revenue per piece for our ground and air products was impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 4 2010 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue per piece for our air products was negatively affected in 2009 by a decline in the fuel surcharge rate for air products additionally the revenue per piece decline for our air products was impacted by lower average package weights and a mix shift toward lower yielding products reflecting the economic recession in the united states the decline in revenue per piece for our ground products was primarily due to a decrease in the fuel surcharge rate but was also impacted by lower average package weights 

the factors decreasing revenue per piece for our ground and air products were partially offset by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 5 2009 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

the trend towards lower package weights began to stabilize in the fourth quarter however product mix within our air and ground services continued to adversely impact revenue per piece as the loweryielding products within those categories represented a larger share of our overall package volume 

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows 

 

 on january 4 2010 and january 5 2009 we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 in each of the two years the 2010 increase and 2009 decrease in the air and ground fuel surcharges are due to the significant variations in jet and diesel fuel prices in addition to the reduction in the index on the air surcharge total domestic fuel surcharge revenue net of the impact of hedging increased by 592 million in 2010 primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates described above as 

  

well as the increase in volume for our air and ground products in 2009 fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 1924 billion due to lower fuel surcharge rates and the decline in volume for our air and ground products

2010 compared to 2009 

operating profit in 2010 was positively impacted by the overall economic growth in the us which drove increased volume and yields combined with increased network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives this resulted in strong operating leverage network efficiencies were achieved in 2010 as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and utilized our expanded worldport facility to utilize larger aircraft as well as increase package sorting efficiency these changes have resulted in cost savings through fewer aircraft block hours labor hours in our operations and vehicle miles driven improved pickup and delivery densities have also increased productivity in our operations in addition to these factors management salary costs declined as a result of a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions the combination of these factors led to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 

2009 compared to 2008 

operating profit in 2009 was adversely impacted by the us economic recession decreased network efficiencies due to the decline in volume changes in package characteristics and a shift in product mix away from our premium services operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match these lower volume levels as well as reduced labor hours and employee headcount resulting in cost savings operating profit trends improved during the fourth quarter of 2009 due to both improving volume trends and the positive impact of continued cost and production efficiencies which combined to improve the operating margin to 101 for the quarter

volume 

2010 compared to 2009 

export volume increased for 2010 as the worldwide economy and world trade continued to improve we experienced strong growth in asia where volume grew 28 due to a combination of regional economic growth and geographic expansion of our service offerings european export volume also had strong growth for the year increasing 10 compared with the prior year due to market share gains economic growth in certain key markets and an overall expansion of trade in the european union us origin export volume also had solid growth during the year our premium worldwide express and expedited products grew at a relatively faster rate than our standard transborder and trade direct products 

nonus domestic volume increased 152 for the year due in part to the acquisition of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as “unsped” in turkey in the third quarter of 2009 excluding the acquisition of unsped nonus domestic volume increased 97 led by the strength in core european markets canada and mexico 

2009 compared to 2008 

export volume declined primarily due to weakness in the asia europe and us export lanes as the worldwide economic recession and slowdown in world trade more than offset market share gains transborder export volume was relatively stronger within the european union and north america trade areas while volume in the longer export trade lanes was comparatively weaker nonus domestic volume increased for the year largely due to the acquisition of unsped as well as volume growth in germany france poland and canada 

by the fourth quarter of 2009 export volume began to improve as global trade and economic activity accelerated the asia and us export lanes demonstrated significant improvement as those trade areas suffered a relatively greater decline in the early part of the year domestic volume continued to benefit from the unsped acquisition as well as market share gains and general economic improvement in europe and the americas volume was relatively stronger in the small and middle market customer segments 

revenue per piece 

2010 compared to 2009 

export revenue per piece increased during 2010 largely due to higher fuel surcharge rates base rate increases and product mix export revenue per piece increased as higheryielding products such as worldwide express and worldwide expedited grew at a relatively faster pace in 2010 we experienced an overall lengthening of trade lanes as interregional trade increased especially in our asiatoeurope and asiatous export lanes leading to relatively stronger growth for our premium products the impact of currency net of hedging resulted in a decrease to revenue growth during the year domestic revenue per piece decreased primarily due to the impact of loweryielding domestic packages from the unsped acquisition total average revenue per piece increased 07 for the year on a currencyadjusted basis 

on january 4 2010 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market 

2009 compared to 2008 

export revenue per piece decreased largely due to the adverse impact of currency exchange rates lower fuel surcharge rates and product mix but was partially offset by base rate increases that took effect in the first 

  

quarter of 2009 currencyadjusted export revenue per piece declined 101 for 2009 export revenue per piece was impacted by the lower revenue per piece transborder products comprising a relatively larger portion of our total volume as we experienced larger volume declines on some of our longer export trade lanes with higher yields domestic revenue per piece decreased which was primarily caused by adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece declined 72 for the year as well as the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates total average revenue per piece decreased 121 for the year on a currencyadjusted basis 

on january 5 2009 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market 

export revenue per piece showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter as higheryielding trade lanes such as asia to europe and asia to north america comprised a larger proportion of our total export volume revenue per piece in the fourth quarter benefited from a weaker us dollar but continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates 

fuel surcharges 

on january 4 2010 and january 5 2009 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 in each of the two years the fuel surcharges for products originating outside the united states continue to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 299 million in 2010 due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 788 million in 2009 due to lower fuel surcharge rates caused by decreased fuel prices but this was partially offset by an increase in international air volume 

operating profit and margin 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in operating profit for 2010 was primarily driven by volume increases in all major regions and trade lanes worldwide the shift in product mix to our highermargin premium services also contributed to the increase in operating profits additionally network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives created operating leverage throughout our operations these factors led to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decline in operating profit for the year was caused primarily by a shift in product mix away from our premium services and volume declines in some of the longer export trade lanes operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense to reduce costs we adjusted our air network and reduced block hours and flight segments in certain international regions the volume trends began to improve later in the year and in the fourth quarter operating profit increased 19 excluding an impairment charge in 2008 as the impact of cost initiatives and network improvements drove an improvement in the operating margin to 167 

  

supply chain  freight operations 

 

  

 revenue 

2010 compared to 2009 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to growth in the demand for forwarding as a result of the continued expansion of the worldwide economy inventory rebuilding and world trade in our forwarding business both air freight and ocean freight experienced solid revenue growth due primarily to higher volumes fuel surcharges and other accessorial charges international air freight tonnage increased 19 for 2010 compared with the prior year in our logistics products we experienced growth in mail services and distribution revenue with solid increases being achieved in the healthcare and technology sectors 

freight revenue increased primarily due to higher fuel surcharge rates and a base rate increase that took effect in january 2010 average ltl shipments per day weight per shipment and ltl revenue per hundredweight all increased during the year largely due to our strategy of maintaining our focus on yields and targeting certain customer segments the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to an increase in base prices that took effect in january 2010 as ups freight increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 57 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states canada and mexico an additional 59 rate increase took effect october 18 2010 additionally ltl revenue per hundredweight increased as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue increased 105 million for the year primarily resulting from higher diesel fuel prices 

  

the other businesses within supply chain  freight experienced an increase in revenue a primary driver of this increase was our ups customer solutions business which provides a range of services eg project management industrial engineering transportation fleet services distribution network analysis package engineering and package visibility 

2009 compared to 2008 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased for the year and was caused primarily by weakness in demand for freight forwarding due to global economic weakness and declines in international trade forwarding revenue declined in all major transportation modes including domestic and international air freight and ocean freight and was impacted by lower volumes lower fuel surcharges and lower security and other accessorial charges logistics distribution and postsales service revenue also declined primarily resulting from the weak global economy however mail services revenue increased for the year 

freight revenue declined primarily due to lower fuel surcharge rates and a decline in average daily ltl shipments total ltl weight per shipment declined for the year reflecting the weak ltl market and the ongoing economic recession in the united states in 2009 average ltl shipments per day also declined as market share gains were more than offset by the impact of the weak economy ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased primarily as a result of the lower fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue declined 188 million for the year primarily resulting from lower diesel fuel prices however this decline was partially offset by an increase in base prices that took effect on january 5 2009 as ups freight increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 59 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business and our financial business experienced a decline in revenue primarily caused by lower interest rates and decreased loan volume in our financial business 

revenue trends for our forwarding logistics and ltl products improved in the fourth quarter of 2009 largely resulting from favorable comparisons with the prior year the change in revenue for our forwarding and logistics businesses benefited from the weaker us dollar during the quarter while revenue in the forwarding and ltl units continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue 

operating profit and margin 

2010 compared to 2009 

operating profit in the forwarding unit increased during 2010 largely due to a strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses but was partially offset by capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of 2010 capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner resulting in a negative impact to our operating profit and margin this situation improved during the second half of 2010 as capacity constraints lessened and we were able to implement revenue management plans which better matched customer pricing with market conditions our logistics unit had a solid increase in profitability for the year which was driven primarily by an expansion of operating margins due to operating efficiencies and a focus on higher margin industry sectors 

operating profit for our ups freight unit increased in 2010 compared with the prior year largely due to better productivity and increases in base pricing and volume productivity metrics increased including increases in pickup and delivery stops per hour and linehaul utilization 

all of the remaining businesses within this segment had an operating profit during the year combined operating profit for these businesses was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to the gain on sale of substantially all our international mail boxes etc operations during the second quarter of 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

the lower operating profit in the forwarding unit was impacted by the weak global demand for forwarding services as well as capacity reductions by outside ocean and air freight carriers during the latter half of 2009 and particularly in the fourth quarter capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers resulting in a negative impact to operating profit and margin the operating profit for our logistics unit declined slightly and was impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of some noncore european logistics operations however the operating margin in this business remained stable as costs were reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues 

our ups freight unit reported improved profitability for 2009 due to a reduction in vacation accruals resulting from modifications in vacation policies and changes in the workforce coverage of our individual plans excluding this reduction in vacation liabilities the ups freight unit reported a small operating loss due to the economic recession and difficult ltl market in the united states 

the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased during the year the increase was primarily driven by a gain on sale of substantially all of our international mail boxes etc operations during the second quarter 

operating expenses 

 

 compensation and benefits 

the increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2010 compared with 2009 was impacted by several items payroll costs increased largely due to higher accruals for management incentive compensation plans resulting from improved company financial results union payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases these factors were partially offset by a decline in union labor hours as well as a reduction in management salary costs resulting from a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 

  

benefits expense increased in 2010 due largely to increases in pension expense health and welfare expense and relocationrelated benefit costs for management employees pension expense increases resulted primarily from higher union contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans the relocation benefit costs relate to the restructuring of our domestic package operations that occurred in the first quarter of 2010 this increase in health and welfare costs which was primarily driven by health cost inflation was somewhat mitigated by reductions in the total number of management employees and union employees covered by upssponsored health and welfare benefit plans 

the decrease in compensation and benefits expense during 2009 compared with 2008 was impacted by several items a large component of this decrease was related to employee payroll costs as union labor hours declined as a result of lower us domestic package volume and management payroll declined as a result of a reduction in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with a wage freeze benefits expense increased due to higher employee health and welfare program costs which were impacted by higher union contribution rates and increased pension expense pension expense increases resulted from higher union contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans combined with increased interest costs a decrease in our expected return on plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses for companysponsored plans the interest cost grew due to continued service accruals while the decrease in expected return on plan assets and the actuarial losses were primarily due to the negative asset returns experienced in 2008 the overall increase in benefits expense was partially offset by a freeze in the company contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan 

repairs and maintenance 

repairs and maintenance expense increased in 2010 largely due to higher costs for maintenance on our vehicle fleet repairs and maintenance expense declined in 2009 largely due to reduced vehicle maintenance expenses resulting from a reduction in miles driven 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2010 primarily as a result of depreciation expense on equipment and facilities capitalized in conjunction with the recent worldport expansion amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of new intangibles recognized related to the unsped acquisition in turkey in the third quarter of 2009 as well as corporate sponsorships entered into in 2010 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense on equipment and facilities as certain worldport assets became fully depreciated as well as lower software amortization resulting from fewer new capitalized software projects these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles resulting from new deliveries in 2008 and 2009 

purchased transportation 

the increase in purchased transportation in 2010 was driven by higher freight forwarding volume and rates in asia and europe as well as increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by thirdparty carriers as a result of higher fuel prices the decrease in purchased transportation in 2009 was driven by a combination of lower volume in our international package and forwarding businesses a stronger us dollar and decreased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by thirdparty carriers as a result of lower fuel prices 

fuel 

the increase in fuel expense in 2010 was caused primarily by higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as a slight increase in usage of these products in our operations the decrease in fuel expense in 2009 was impacted by significantly lower prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as lower usage of these products in our operations 

  

other occupancy 

the decrease in other occupancy expense in 2010 was primarily due to decreased labor and overhead expenses and lower rent expense on leased facilities the decrease in other occupancy expense in 2009 was primarily caused by lower electricity and natural gas costs as well as lower rent expense 

other expenses 

the decrease in other expenses in 2010 was largely due to reductions in bad debt expense and foreign currency transaction expense which reflected gains during 2010 compared to losses in 2009 additionally we incurred a loss on the sale of a french repair business in 2009 additional expense reductions in 2010 were due to cost containment programs including reductions in telecom costs office supplies and outside professional fees we also incurred lower expenses associated with auto liability insurance and customer claims for lost or damaged packages 

the decline in other expenses in 2009 exclusive of impairment charges was due in part to certain variable costs that declined as a result of lower package volume such as the expense associated with customer claims for lost or damaged packages rent expense for transportation equipment cargo handling costs and aircraft landing fees additionally certain other costs declined primarily as a result of cost containment programs such as employee expense reimbursements office supplies professional services and advertising costs 

investment income and interest expense 

 

 investment income 

the decrease in investment income in 2010 was primarily due to a lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states as well as higher impairment losses on our holdings of auction rate and preferred securities the 2009 decline was largely due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments a significantly lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states and a loss on the fair value adjustments of certain investment partnerships 

during the second quarter of 2010 we recorded impairment losses on certain assetbacked auction rate securities the impairment charge resulted from provisions that allow the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newly issued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value these securities which had a cost basis of 128 million were written down to their fair value of 107 million as of june 30 2010 resulting in an otherthantemporary impairment of 21 million 

during the second quarter of 2009 we recorded impairment losses on certain perpetual preferred securities and an auction rate security collateralized by preferred securities issued by large financial institutions the 

  

impairment charge resulted from conversion offers from the issuers of these securities at prices well below the stated redemption value of the preferred shares these securities which had a cost basis of 42 million were written down to their fair value of 25 million as of june 30 2009 resulting in an otherthantemporary impairment of 17 million 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in 2010 was primarily due to lower average debt balances but this was partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to the recent completion of several large construction projects including our worldport expansion excluding the currency remeasurement charge the 2009 decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 

income tax expense 

 

 2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in our effective tax rate in 2010 compared with 2009 was attributable to the higher marginal tax rate applied to the gain on the sale of real estate as well as the change in the tax filing status of a german subsidiary that occurred in the first quarter of 2010 additionally we are currently unable to recognize the entire potential tax benefit of tax loss carryforwards generated from the sale of a supply chain  freight business in germany in the first quarter of 2010 

excluding these items our adjusted yeartodate effective tax rate decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the effect of having a higher proportion of our taxable income in 2010 being subject to tax outside the united states where statutory tax rates are generally lower 

2009 compared to 2008 

income tax expense declined primarily due to lower pretax income the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges described previously which were not deductible for tax purposes and resulted in the effective tax rate increasing by 41 this was partially offset by an increase in our first quarter 2009 income tax provision as a result of providing a valuation allowance of 14 million against certain deferred tax assets in our international package business 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2008 to 2010 time period in 2010 operating cash flow was reduced by 20 billion in discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans as well as an increase in working capital needs due to underlying growth in our business in 2009 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the decline in profitability for our three reporting segments in 2008 operating cash flow increased by approximately 1228 billion due to tax refunds received that year related to our previous withdrawal from the central states pension plan the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our operating cash flows in millions 

 

  

 except for the 20 billion discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans in 2010 contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans the remaining increases in contributions in 2010 and 2009 were largely due to minimum funding requirements related to the ups ibt pension plan as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan in january 2011 we made a 12 billion contribution to the ups ibt pension plan which represented an acceleration of contributions that would have been required in 2011 and over 350 million in contributions that would not have been required until after 2011 

investing activities 

our primary uses of cash flows for investing activities were for capital expenditures as follows amounts in millions 

 

   

we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations in 2010 we reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our current anticipated operating needs future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions 

the decline in capital expenditures on buildings and facilities primarily resulted from the completion of several large hub construction and expansion projects including our worldport hub expansion as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe canada and china in 2009 we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion which increased the sorting capacity by 15 the final phase of the worldport expansion was completed in 2010 with an additional sorting capacity of approximately 20 in 2008 we opened our new international air hub in shanghai china and also began construction of our new intraasia air hub in shenzhen china which became operational in february 2010 

capital spending on aircraft over the 2008 to 2010 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing 767300 and 747400 and md11 aircraft capital spending on vehicles was primarily for replacement assets in our package delivery and ltl operations we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2011 will be approximately 22 billion or approximately 4 of revenue future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions 

the increase in proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment is largely due to real estate sales and the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2010 the net change in finance receivables is primarily due to customer paydowns and new loan origination activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300 and boeing 747400 aircraft orders and changes in restricted cash balances we maintain an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our selfinsurance obligations and we deposited 95 and 191 million in cash collateral with the insurance carrier under this agreement during 2009 and 2008 respectively we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of 111 117 and 208 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

financing activities 

our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares pay cash dividends and repay debt principal as follows amounts in millions except per share data 

 

 in january 2008 the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 100 billion share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions as a result of the uncertain economic environment in 2010 and 2009 we slowed our share repurchase activity and repurchased shares at a rate that approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program as of december 31 2010 we had 5194 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining in 2011 we anticipate increasing our share repurchase activity to approximately 20 billion 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in 2008 the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration as in past years this dividend was payable the following january as a result a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008 in february 2011 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 047 to 052 per share an 11 increase 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we completed senior fixed rate note offerings of 20 20 and 40 billion respectively these note offerings were used for various purposes including discretionary contributions to upssponsored pension plans the retirement of existing debt instruments and the refinancing of commercial paper that was used to fund our withdrawal from the central states pension plan 

  

other than commercial paper repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations redemption of facilities bonds and the ups notes program and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in 2010 the cash outflows in other financing activities is largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2010 2009 and 2008 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings which resulted in cash inflows outflows of 11 243 and 84 million respectively 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to 100 billion under our us commercial paper program as of december 31 2010 we had 341 million of commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 018 and a weighted average maturity of 14 days the amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2011 is expected to fluctuate we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december 31 2010 

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of 15 billion and expires on april 14 2011 interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90day libor plus a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd for our 1year credit default swap spread subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s if our public debt ratings are a  a2 or above the minimum applicable margin is 050 and the maximum applicable margin is 150 if our public debt ratings are lower than a  a2 the minimum applicable margin is 100 and the maximum applicable margin is 250 

the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of 10 billion and expires on april 19 2012 interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points at december 31 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities 

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants as of december 31 2010 and for all prior periods presented we have satisfied these financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur and limit the amount of attributable debt in saleleaseback transactions to 10 of net tangible assets as of december 31 2010 10 of net tangible assets is equivalent to 2501 billion however we have no covered saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding additionally we are required to maintain a minimum net worth as defined of 50 billion on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2010 our net worth as defined was equivalent to 14174 billion we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

  

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2010 the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts as of december 31 2010 we have firm commitments to purchase 20 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2011 and 2013 and two boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2011 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified pension plans these contributions include those to the ups ibt pension plan which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters as well as the ups pension plan these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above additionally we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond 2015 because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 

we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in 2011 in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 284 million of liabilities for 

  

uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 1580 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2010 we had 577 million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2010 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 602 million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which was certified as a class action in a california federal court in september 2004 plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1300 fulltime supervisors in august 2005 the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims and plaintiffs appealed the ruling in october 2007 the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling in april 2008 the court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for that month after decertification some plaintiffs filed individual lawsuits raising the same allegations as in the underlying class action these individual lawsuits are in various stages we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc centers and the ups store locations these lawsuits relate to the rebranding of mail boxes etc centers to the ups store the ups store business model the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises and ups’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories in one of the actions which is pending in california state court the court certified a class consisting of all mail boxes etc branded stores that rebranded to the ups store in march 2003 we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in barber auto sales v ups which a federal court in alabama certified as a class action in september 2009 the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from ups’s assessment of shipping charge corrections when ups determines that the “dimensional weight” of packages is greater than reported by the shipper we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in afms llc v ups and fedex corporation a lawsuit filed in federal court in the central district of california in august 2010 the plaintiff asserts that ups and fedex violated us antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third party negotiators retained by shippers andor to monopolize a socalled market for 

  

the time sensitive delivery of letters and packages the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has informed us that it has opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third party negotiators we are cooperating with this investigation we deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction most us state and local jurisdictions and many nonus jurisdictions we have substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 2003 during the fourth quarter of 2010 we received a refund of 139 million as a result of the resolution of tax years 2003 through 2004 with the internal revenue service “irs” appeals office along with the audit for tax years 2005 through 2007 the irs is currently examining nonincome based taxes including employment and excise taxes which could lead to proposed assessments the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment we anticipate receipt of the irs reports on these matters by the end of the second quarter of 2011 we have filed all required us state and local returns reporting the result of the resolution of the us federal income tax audit of the tax years 2003 and 2004 a limited number of us state and local matters are the subject of ongoing audits administrative appeals or litigation 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 250000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2013 we have approximately 2800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association “ipa” which becomes amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable in november 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 in october 2006 and have been under the guidance of the national mediation board since january 2008 in january 2011 we reached a tentative agreement with teamsters local 2727 which will run through november 1 2013 when ratified in addition the majority approximately 3300 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” our agreement with the iam runs through july 31 2014 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

in january 2008 a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging pricefixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services ups was not named in this case on july 21 2009 the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the 60 defendants named in the amended complaint we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

other matters 

we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj regarding the doj’s investigation into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december 2007 

in october 2007 june 2008 and february 2009 we received information requests from the european commission “commission” relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry and subsequently responded to each request on february 9 2010 ups received a statement of objections by the commission this document contains the commission’s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by 18 freight forwarders including ups although it alleges anticompetitive behavior it does not prejudge the commission’s final decision as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts the options available to the commission include taking no action or imposing a monetary fine the range of any potential action by the commission is not reasonably estimable any decision imposing a fine would be subject to appeal ups has responded to the statement of objections including at a july 2010 commission hearing and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding we received an additional information request from the commission in january 2011 and will respond in due course 

in august 2010 competition authorities in brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry approximately 45 freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding including ups ups scs transportes brasil sa and a former employee in brazil ups will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations 

we also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions 

we are cooperating with each of these investigations and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves at this time we are unable to determine the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether any such liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

health care legislation 

the enactment of the “patient protection and affordable care act” and “the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010” in 2010 will bring significant changes to the us health care system the legislation eliminated the tax deductibility of medicare part d subsidies for retiree prescription drug coverage however this impact was not material to our financial results we are evaluating the longterm impacts of this legislation on us it is difficult to estimate the impact due to the nature of our workforce the various years in which certain provisions become applicable and the fact that additional regulatory and rulemaking actions will be occurring our current estimate is that we will incur an additional 50 to 65 million of annual expense beginning in 2011 associated with active employee healthcare coverage which is primarily due to the multiple coverage provisions of the legislation which require the expansion of dependent coverage to age 26 among other requirements the december 31 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the postretirement medical plans increased by 37 million due to the excise tax associated with the legislation 

rate adjustments 

in october 2010 we announced that an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect january 3 2011 ups ground service rates increased a net 49 through a combination of a 59 increase in rates and a 1 reduction in the index used to determine the ground fuel surcharge ups next day air ups 2 nd day air ups 3 day select and international air shipments originating in the united states including worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased a net 49 through a combination of a 69 increase in base rates and a 2 reduction in the index used to determine the air fuel surcharge these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

  

also in october 2010 we announced a 59 general rate increase for our ups freight ltl unit which took effect october 18 2010 the increase covers noncontractual shipments in the us canada and mexico and applies to minimum charge ltl rates and accessorial charges 

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

provisions within the following accounting standards were adopted during the years covered by these financial statements 

financial instruments  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance in february 2007 that gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie the fair value option on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings additionally this guidance allowed for a onetime election for existing positions upon adoption with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings we adopted this standard on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method accordingly we recorded a 16 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 these investments are reported in “other noncurrent assets” on the consolidated balance sheets 

compensationretirement benefits  we previously utilized the early measurement date option available in accounting for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans and we measured the funded status of our plans as of september 30 each year under guidance issued by the fasb we were required to use a december 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008 as a result of this change in measurement date we recorded a cumulative effect aftertax 44 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 

beginning in 2009 new guidance was adopted that required disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan investment policies and strategies major categories of plan assets inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets these disclosures are provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements and disclosures  the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements that took effect on january 1 2008 and are presented in notes 2 3 4 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements on january 1 2009 we implemented the previously deferred provisions of this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the accounting requirements for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying transactions that are not orderly contained the fasb’s guidance were adopted on april 1 2009 but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

derivatives and hedging  the fasb issued certain disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging transactions that took effect on january 1 2009 and are presented in note 14 

  

business combinations  the fasb issued new accounting requirements for business combinations which took effect on january 1 2009 this new guidance was applied to business combinations completed in 2009 but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

consolidation  the fasb issued accounting and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests which took effect on january 1 2009 however this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

accounting standards issued but not yet effective 

accounting guidance issued but not effective until after december 31 2010 are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2010 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2010 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding  logistics ups freight mbe  ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st for each 

  

reporting unit the impairment test involves a twostep process first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this impairment charge resulted from several factors including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance as well as expand service offerings however this process took longer than initially anticipated and thus financial results had been below our expectations additionally the ltl sector in 2008 had been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us lower industrial production and retail sales volatile fuel prices and significant levels of pricebased competition by the fourth quarter of 2008 the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit leading to the goodwill impairment charge 

none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008 nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2009 or 2010 changes in our forecasts could cause book values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2010 would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity based on prior performance and nearterm projections the value assigned to the customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired this impairment was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with the acquired business accordingly an intangible asset impairment charge of 27 million was recorded for the year ended december 31 2008 no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008 nor were any such impairments recognized in 2009 or 2010 

  

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain several singleemployer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation compensation increase rates expected returns on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable and represent our best estimates based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 

  

basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would have resulted in the following increases decreases on the company’s reported costs and obligations for the year 2010 in millions 

 

 our 2011 pension expense will be higher than our 2010 expense due primarily to two negative factors the decline in discount rate used to determine expense from 658 for 2010 to 598 for 2011 and the required amortization of unrecognized losses the majority of which relate to 2008 asset losses outside of the corridor we utilize for accounting purposes these negative factors are partially offset by the additional discretionary contributions that we made in 2010 and 2011 that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2010 we had 17387 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our 

  

projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

in 2008 we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl’s express deferred and international package volume within the united states as well as air transportation services between the united states canada and mexico in early april 2009 ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services additionally our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services as a result of these factors the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 

based on the factors noted above as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc871 and dc873 aircraft fleets we conducted an impairment analysis as of march 31 2009 and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft based on anticipated residual values for the airframes engines and parts we recognized an impairment charge of 181 million in the first quarter of 2009 the dc8 fleets were subsequently retired from service 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates 

  

require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was 127 and 138 million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 199 254 and 277 million respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2010 and 2009 however we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 87 million in cash this transaction was reported in other investing activities in the statements of consolidated cash flows as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting were designated as hedges and maintained their effectiveness the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges which extended through the first quarter of 2009 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the term of these swap agreements is commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize 

  

forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 

we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

credit risk 

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 

 

  

    

the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates respectively was not material as of december 31 2010 or 2009 the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december 31 2010 or 2009

international package 

the international package segment provides air and ground delivery of small packages and letters to more than 200 countries and territories around the world export services cross country boundaries domestic services move shipments within a country’s borders ups’s global presence grew out of its highly refined us domestic business 

 

  

  

  

   

we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades some of our recent acquisitions and investments include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 growth in asia is being driven by global demand which is stimulating improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region particularly in china and india over the last few years ups has steadily increased air service between the us and asia

supply chain  freight segment 

the supply chain  freight segment consists of our forwarding and logistics capabilities as well as our ups freight business unit 

supply chains are becoming increasingly complex as shown in diagram 1 many of our customers large and small have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to improve service to support new business models and to strengthen their balance sheets 

  

this increasing complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade and brokerage services with financial and information services we can meet that demand because

technology 

technology is the backbone of everything we do at ups it is at the heart of customer access to the company 

 

  

  

  

 technology is also the foundation for process improvements within ups that enhance productivity improve efficiency and reduce costs the most comprehensive improvement to our us small package handling facilities was completed in 2007 this multiyear effort reengineered our domestic business based on a datadriven platform and included software hardware and process changes it enables a package center to produce an optimized dispatch plan for every driver and detailed loading instructions for every vehicle before center employees handle any packages this plan reduces mileage driven resulting in substantial fuel savings the reengineered system provides the basis for unique customerfocused services based on the customerspecific data which powers the system 

a new technology we began deploying in 2008 is telematics which combines information from our drivers’ handheld computers with gps and automotive sensors to help us better manage our ground fleet operations it helps us improve vehicle maintenance enhance safety and finetune delivery and pickup service this technology also improves onroad performance by reducing vehicle expense fuel consumption and carbon emissions since 2008 we have equipped approximately 12000 of our us vehicles with the sensors needed to achieve the benefits from this technology

our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable in november 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 in october 2006 in addition the majority approximately 3400 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” in july 2009 a new agreement with the iam was ratified which runs through july 31 2014

we consistently receive numerous awards and wide recognition as an employerofchoice resulting in part from our emphasis on diversity and corporate citizenship 

competition 

we are the largest package delivery company in the world in terms of both revenue and volume we offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and therefore compete with many different local regional national and international companies our competitors include worldwide postal services various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others through our supply chain service offerings we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain financial services and information technology industries 

competitive strengths 

our competitive strengths include 

integrated global network we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through a single pickup and delivery service system 

our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns 

we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

global presence ups has the most balanced presence throughout the world 

  

leadingedge technology we are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs improve service and increase efficiency 

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to conveniently send manage and track their shipments but also to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own web sites

brand equity we have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service reliability and product innovation the distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy reduces the need for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and have spent their entire careers with us many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners

 item 1a risk factors tableend cautionary statement about forwardlooking statements 

this report includes certain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 statements in the future tense and all statements accompanied by terms such as “believe” “project” “expect” “estimate” “assume” “intend” “anticipate” “target” “plan” and variations thereof and similar terms are intended to be forwardlooking statements we intend that all forwardlooking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws pursuant to section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 

our disclosure and analysis in this report in our annual report to shareholders and in our other filings with the securities and exchange filings contain some forwardlooking statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts management believes that these forwardlooking statements are reasonable as and when made however caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forwardlooking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made 

forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those described below and elsewhere in this report and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the securities and exchange commission you should consider the limitations on and risks associated with forwardlooking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forwardlooking statements we do not undertake any obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements 

risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

general economic conditions both in the us and internationally may adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct operations in over 200 countries and territories our us and international operations are subject to normal cycles affecting the economy in general as well the local economic environments in which we operate the factors that create cyclical changes to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors in particular our business is affected by levels of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity to the extent that the current economic recession in the us and worldwide continues for a prolonged period of time or the recovery takes longer than anticipated our business financial position and results of operations could be materially affected 

  

we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we face significant competition on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others competition may also come from other sources in the future some of our competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong as a result of consolidation our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive positions business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the us and internationally 

we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental laws and regulations both in the us and in the other countries in which we operate changes in laws regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations which could adversely affect our financial performance 

increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us 

as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats we cannot determine the effect that these new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results and these rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such potential change 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions for example in the past several years the us congress has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions while these bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emissions especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions and this could impose substantial costs on us these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or trucks prematurely until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results notwithstanding our widely recognized position as a leader in sustainable business practices it is reasonably possible however that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air services 

  

strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

a significant number of our employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and our airline pilots airline mechanics ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements strikes work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 

we are exposed to the effects of changing prices of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruptions in supplies of these commodities 

changing fuel and energy costs may have a significant impact on our operations we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher yielding air products to lower yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume if fuel prices rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our shortterm operating results there can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices moreover we could experience a disruption in energy supplies including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel as a result of war actions by producers or other factors which are beyond our control which could have an adverse affect on our business 

changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have an adverse affect on our results 

we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies and in particular the euro british pound and canadian dollar 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and that portion of our longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of this report during 2008 credit markets tightened and the global economy slowed we are not dependent on the credit markets to fund current operations 

we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and make limited use of currency exchange contracts over the counter option contracts commodity forwards swaps and futures contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values but changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged 

if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers service quality issues actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies also adverse publicity surrounding labor relations environmental concerns security matters political activities and the like or attempting to connect our company to these sorts of issues either in the united states or other countries in which 

  

we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our services by customers damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

a significant privacy breach could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data security 

the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our network involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customers employees and others breaches in security could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our brand and reputation or disruptions in our operations in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

we have invested in a technology infrastructure which supports our global air and ground network and is critical to support our operations and customer needs any major disruption to this infrastructure could adversely impact our operations customers and global commerce 

our ability to serve customers and to compete effectively depends to a large part upon the reliability and speed of our technology network while we have built a multilayered architecture to support swiftlyexpanding worldwide operations and we ensure that our infrastructure is robust reliable and redundant there are risks of malicious or unintentional disruptions to the internet or our technology infrastructure which could adversely impact our operations and consequently our customers 

we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels 

we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft vehicles technology facilities and sorting and other types of equipment to support both our existing and anticipated growth of our business forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends changes in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions however these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins in an adverse economy 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets 

we have significant international operations and while the geographical diversity of our international operations helps ensure that we are not overly reliant on a single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social developments beyond our control emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broadbased downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial writedowns of the carrying value of our assets thereby reducing our net income 

our regular review of the carrying value of our assets including our intangible and tangible assets and investments has resulted from time to time in significant impairments and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or 

  

market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment writedowns of our intangible or other assets at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets are shorter than we originally estimated such changes could reduce our net income 

employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us 

with approximately 408000 employees including approximately 340000 in the us our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant in recent years we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control including in particular ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation continued increasing healthcare costs volatility in investment returns and discount rates as well as changes in laws regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance increases in health care costs changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practices environmental liability and other matters any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends in part upon the successful integration between the businesses involved the performance of the underlying operation capabilities or technologies and the management of the transacted operations accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations unanticipated performance issues transactionrelated charges or charges for impairment of longterm assets that we acquire 

insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a combination of both selfinsurance and highdeductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage aircraft and related liabilities business interruption and workers’ compensation workers’ compensation automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims on an undiscounted basis our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments which are subject to a high degree of variability if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our ability to selfinsure these risks our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our us domestic package international package and supply chain  freight segments were all negatively affected by the deteriorating worldwide economic situation in 2008 and 2009 declines in world trade us industrial production and retail sales particularly affected our package delivery ltl and forwarding operations our consolidated results are presented in the table below 

 

 volume and revenue trends began to improve in the latter half of 2009 additionally cost containment initiatives and better network efficiencies resulted in improving operating profit trends for our small package operations 

items affecting comparability 

the yearoveryear comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items amounts in millions 

 

 aircraft impairment charges 

in the first quarter of 2009 we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc8 aircraft fleet and recorded an impairment charge of 181 million which affected our us domestic package segment in the first quarter of 2007 we completed an impairment assessment of our boeing 727 and 747 aircraft fleets and recognized an impairment charge of 221 million of which 159 million impacted our us domestic package segment and 62 million impacted our international package segment these charges as well as our accounting policies pertaining to longlived assets are discussed further in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

  

goodwill impairment charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this charge as well as our accounting policies pertaining to goodwill is discussed further in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

intangible impairment charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed an impairment assessment on a customer list intangible asset related to our domestic package entity in the united kingdom we recorded a 27 million charge related to this assessment which is further discussed in “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

special voluntary separation opportunity “svso” charge 

in december 2006 we offered the svso to approximately 640 employees who worked in nonoperating functions this program was established to improve the efficiency of nonoperating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company the svso ended in february 2007 and 195 or 30 of eligible employees accepted the offer as a result we recorded a charge to expense of approximately 68 million in the first quarter of 2007 to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 

pension plan withdrawal charge 

our national master agreement with the teamsters allowed us upon ratification to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed singleemployer plan for this group “ups ibt pension plan” upon ratification of the contract in december 2007 and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund we recorded a 61 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability and made a december 2007 payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 

the withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the central states pension fund in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” we negotiated our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as part of our national master agreement with the teamsters which included other modifications to hourly wage rates healthcare and pension benefits and work rules we sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges and would present a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participated in the fund we believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to ups teamster employees through the new ups ibt pension plan as the ups ibt pension plan matures we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the central states pension fund 

france restructuring charge 

in the third quarter of 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program which was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in france in july 2007 employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase these severance benefits were formuladriven and were in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements we recorded a restructuring charge of 46 million in 2007 related to this program 

  

currency remeasurement charge 

during the second quarter of 2009 we incurred a 77 million noncash pretax currency remeasurement charge on certain foreign currency denominated obligations 

results of operations—segment review 

the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with certain nongaap financial measures including operating profit operating margin pretax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the noncomparable items discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses 

us domestic package operations 

 

 volume 

2009 compared to 2008 

in 2009 our overall volume declined as decreases in industrial production and retail sales reduced overall demand in the us small package market our air product volume was stronger than our ground volume as our air volume benefited from market share gains resulting from the recent departure of a competitor in the us market as well as improving economic trends in the latter half of the year the growth in air volume was strongest in our less timesensitive products such as next day air saver and three day select 

  

volume trends improved in the fourth quarter largely as a result of overall economic improvements as average daily volume for next day air and deferred products increased 28 and 43 respectively over 2008 levels ground volume demonstrated an improving trend over the previous quarters despite a 29 decline in the fourth quarter compared with 2008 

2008 compared to 2007 

us domestic ground and air volume declined primarily as a result of the recession in the us economy relatively high energy costs during most of 2008 combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors adversely affected the small package market which placed additional pressure on our domestic package volume these declining volume trends worsened through the year with next day air deferred and ground volume declining 86 35 and 21 respectively during the fourth quarter 

revenue per piece 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue per piece for our air products was negatively affected in 2009 by a decline in the fuel surcharge rate for air products additionally the revenue per piece decline for our air products was impacted by lower average package weights and a mix shift toward lower yielding products reflecting the economic recession in the united states the decline in revenue per piece for our ground products was primarily due to a decrease in the fuel surcharge rate but was also impacted by lower average package weights 

the factors decreasing revenue per piece for our ground and air products were partially offset by an increase in base rates that took effect on january 5 2009 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 

the trend towards lower package weights began to stabilize in the fourth quarter however product mix within our air and ground services continued to adversely impact revenue per piece as the loweryielding products within those categories represented a larger share of our overall package volume 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenue per piece for our air products increased primarily due to a base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products this increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights a mix shift toward lower yielding products and hedging losses revenue per piece for our ground products increased primarily due to the base rate increase as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate 

a base rate increase became effective on december 31 2007 which increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

  

fuel surcharges 

ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services the air fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows 

 

 on january 5 2009 and december 31 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the 2009 decrease and 2008 increase in the air and ground fuel surcharges are due to the significant variations in jet and diesel fuel prices in addition to the reduction in the index on the air surcharge total domestic fuel surcharge revenue net of the impact of hedging decreased by 1924 billion in 2009 primarily due to the lower fuel surcharge rates discussed above as well as the decline in volume for our air and ground products in 2008 fuel surcharge revenue net of the impact of hedging losses increased by 1119 billion primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates but partially offset by the decline in volume for our air and ground products 

operating profit and margin 

2009 compared to 2008 

operating profit in 2009 was adversely impacted by the us economic recession decreased network efficiencies due to the decline in volume changes in package characteristics and a shift in product mix away from our premium services operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match these lower volume levels as well as reduced labor hours and employee headcount resulting in cost savings operating profit trends improved during the fourth quarter of 2009 due to both improving volume trends and the positive impact of continued cost and production efficiencies which combined to improve the operating margin to 101 for the quarter 

2008 compared to 2007 

operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by the us recession lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume lower average package weights and a shift in product mix away from our premium services partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of 2008 operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments because of this time lag fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008 which is the opposite effect the company experienced in 2007 when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted 

  

international package operations 

 

  

 volume 

2009 compared to 2008 

export volume declined primarily due to weakness in the asia europe and us export lanes as the worldwide economic recession and slowdown in world trade more than offset market share gains transborder export volume was relatively stronger within the european union and north america trade areas while volume in the longer export trade lanes was comparatively weaker nonus domestic volume increased for the year largely due to the acquisition of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as “unsped” in turkey as well as volume growth in germany france poland and canada 

by the fourth quarter of 2009 export volume began to improve as global trade and economic activity accelerated the asia and us export lanes demonstrated significant improvement as those trade areas suffered a relatively greater decline in the early part of the year domestic volume continued to benefit from the unsped acquisition as well as market share gains and general economic improvement in europe and the americas volume was relatively stronger in the small and middle market customer segments 

2008 compared to 2007 

export volume increased in each region throughout the world in 2008 however volume began to slow in the latter half of 2008 due to difficult worldwide economic conditions intraregional volume continued to experience solid growth especially in europe asian export volume continued to benefit from our geographic 

  

service expansion including the connection of several cities to our new air hub in shanghai china export volume growth was negatively impacted by declines in shipments to the us from other regions in the world due to the slowing us economy export volume trends weakened in the latter half of the year due to the severe global economic slowdown with fourth quarter export volume increasing at a much slower rate than what has been experienced over the last several years nonus domestic volume increased and was impacted by volume growth in our domestic businesses in the euro zone and canada but negatively affected by the weak economic conditions in the united kingdom 

revenue per piece 

2009 compared to 2008 

export revenue per piece decreased largely due to the adverse impact of currency exchange rates lower fuel surcharge rates and product mix but was partially offset by base rate increases that took effect in the first quarter of 2009 currencyadjusted export revenue per piece declined 101 for 2009 export revenue per piece was impacted by the lower revenue per piece transborder products comprising a relatively larger portion of our total volume as we experienced larger volume declines on some of our longer export trade lanes with higher yields domestic revenue per piece decreased which was primarily caused by adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations currencyadjusted domestic revenue per piece declined 72 for the year as well as the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates total average revenue per piece decreased 121 for the year on a currencyadjusted basis 

on january 5 2009 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market 

export revenue per piece showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter as higheryielding trade lanes such as asia to europe and asia to north america comprised a larger proportion of our total export volume revenue per piece in the fourth quarter benefited from a weaker us dollar but continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates 

2008 compared to 2007 

export revenue per piece increased largely due to base rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and favorable currency exchange rates but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a shift away from our premium services domestic revenue per piece increased and was affected by rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and favorable exchange rates total average revenue per piece increased 27 on a currencyadjusted basis 

on december 31 2007 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 

total revenue per piece declined 82 in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar currencyadjusted revenue per piece declined 30 but was also impacted by an acceleration in the shift away from our premium services and lower package weights 

fuel surcharges 

on january 5 2009 and december 31 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the fuel surcharges for products originating outside the united states continue to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue 

  

decreased by 788 million in 2009 due to lower fuel surcharge rates caused by decreased fuel prices as well as a decrease in international air volume fuel surcharge revenue increased by 586 million in 2008 due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 

operating profit and margin 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decline in operating profit for the year was caused primarily by a shift in product mix away from our premium services and volume declines in some of the longer export trade lanes operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense to reduce costs we adjusted our air network and reduced block hours and flight segments in certain international regions the volume trends began to improve later in the year and in the fourth quarter operating profit increased 19 excluding an impairment charge in 2008 as the impact of cost initiatives and network improvements drove an improvement in the operating margin to 167 

2008 compared to 2007 

the decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows such as the reduced import volume into the united states operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network 

because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of 2008 operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments as a result of this time lag fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008 which is the opposite effect the company experienced in 2007 when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted 

supply chain  freight operations 

 

  

   

revenue 

2009 compared to 2008 

forwarding and logistics revenue decreased for the year and was caused primarily by weakness in demand for freight forwarding due to global economic weakness and declines in international trade forwarding revenue declined in all major transportation modes including domestic and international air freight and ocean freight and was impacted by lower volumes lower fuel surcharges and lower security and other accessorial charges logistics distribution and postsales service revenue also declined primarily resulting from the weak global economy however mail services revenue increased for the year 

freight revenue declined primarily due to lower fuel surcharge rates and a decline in average daily ltl shipments total ltl weight per shipment declined for the year reflecting the weak ltl market and the ongoing economic recession in the united states in 2009 average ltl shipments per day also declined as market share gains were more than offset by the impact of the weak economy ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased primarily as a result of the lower fuel surcharge rates as total fuel surcharge revenue declined 188 million for the year primarily resulting from lower diesel fuel prices however this decline was partially offset by an increase in base prices that took effect on january 5 2009 as ups freight increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates an average of 59 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business and our financial business experienced a decline in revenue primarily caused by lower interest rates and decreased loan volume in our financial business 

revenue trends for our forwarding logistics and ltl products improved in the fourth quarter of 2009 largely resulting from favorable comparisons with the prior year the change in revenue for our forwarding and logistics businesses benefited from the weaker us dollar during the quarter while revenue in the forwarding and ltl units continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue 

2008 compared to 2007 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased primarily due to growth in international air freight north american air freight distribution services and mail services revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges expanded air freight service offerings overall market growth and improved customer retention rates growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business 

freight increased revenue for the year as a result of improved yields and higher fuel surcharge rates but partially offset by a decline in average daily ltl shipments average ltl shipments per day decreased reflecting the weak ltl market in the united states in 2008 as compared with 2007 however ltl revenue per hundredweight increased due to an increase in base rates in 2008 and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher diesel fuel prices on february 4 2008 ups freight increased minimum charge ltl and tl rates by an average of 54 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight increased revenue largely due to our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

revenue declined by 144 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 as difficult worldwide economic conditions slowing world trade and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics businesses the strengthening us dollar resulted in a 58 million negative impact to the change in revenue in the fourth quarter 

  

operating profit and margin 

2009 compared to 2008 

the lower operating profit in the forwarding unit was impacted by the weak global demand for forwarding services as well as capacity reductions by outside ocean and air freight carriers during the latter half of 2009 and particularly in the fourth quarter capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers resulting in a negative impact to operating profit and margin the operating profit for our logistics unit declined slightly and was impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of some noncore european logistics operations however the operating margin in this business remained stable as costs were reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues 

our ups freight unit reported improved profitability for 2009 due to a reduction in vacation accruals resulting from modifications in vacation policies and changes in the workforce coverage of our individual plans excluding this reduction in vacation liabilities the ups freight unit reported a small operating loss due to the economic recession and difficult ltl market in the united states 

the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased during the year the increase was primarily driven by a gain on sale of substantially all of our international mail boxes etc operations during the second quarter 

2008 compared to 2007 

operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics businesses primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization operating profit was lower at ups freight during the year largely as a result of the slowing ltl market in the united states the overall segment operating margin improved excluding the goodwill impairment charge due to the improved margins in the forwarding and logistics businesses 

operating expenses 

 

   

compensation and benefits 

the decrease in compensation and benefits expense during 2009 compared with 2008 was impacted by several items a large component of this decrease was related to employee payroll costs as union labor hours declined as a result of lower us domestic package volume and management payroll declined as a result of a reduction in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with a wage freeze benefits expense increased due to higher employee health and welfare program costs which were impacted by higher union contribution rates and increased pension expense pension expense increases resulted from higher union contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans combined with increased interest costs a decrease in our expected return on plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses for companysponsored plans the interest cost grew due to continued service accruals while the decrease in expected return on plan assets and the actuarial losses were primarily due to the negative asset returns experienced in 2008 the overall increase in benefits expense was partially offset by a freeze in the company contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan 

compensation and benefits expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 excluding charges for the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal the svso and the france restructuring increased benefit expenses were largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs which was impacted by medical cost inflation employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our nonunion employees 

repairs and maintenance 

repairs and maintenance expense declined in 2009 largely due to reduced vehicle maintenance expenses resulting from a reduction in miles driven the 2008 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense on equipment and facilities as certain worldport assets became fully depreciated as well as lower software amortization resulting from fewer new capitalized software projects these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles resulting from new deliveries in 2008 and 2009 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2008 resulted primarily from higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles due to new deliveries but was partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects 

purchased transportation 

the decrease in purchased transportation in 2009 was driven by a combination of lower volume in our international package and forwarding businesses a stronger us dollar and decreased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by thirdparty carriers as a result of lower fuel prices the increase in purchased transportation in 2008 was attributable to a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses a weaker us dollar and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by thirdparty carriers resulting from higher fuel prices 

fuel 

the decrease in fuel expense in 2009 was impacted by significantly lower prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as lower usage of these products in our operations the increase in fuel expense in 2008 resulted from higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains 

  

other occupancy 

the decrease in other occupancy expense in 2009 was primarily caused by lower electricity and natural gas costs as well as lower rent expense the 2008 increase in other occupancy expense resulted from higher rent property tax electricity and natural gas expense the changes in both years were significantly impacted by changes in energy commodity prices 

other expenses 

the decline in other expenses in 2009 exclusive of impairment charges was due in part to certain variable costs that declined as a result of lower package volume such as the expense associated with customer claims for lost or damaged packages rent expense for transportation equipment cargo handling costs and aircraft landing fees additionally certain other costs declined primarily as a result of cost containment programs such as employee expense reimbursements office supplies professional services and advertising costs 

the increase in other expenses in 2008 exclusive of impairment charges was attributable to increased expenses for leased transportation equipment data processing advertising professional services and bad debts 

investment income and interest expense 

 

 investment income 

the 2009 decline was largely due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments a significantly lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states and a loss on the fair value adjustments of certain investment partnerships the 2008 decline was primarily due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments a lower yield earned on our investments and impairment losses 

during the second quarter of 2009 we recorded impairment losses on certain perpetual preferred securities and an auction rate security collateralized by preferred securities issued by large financial institutions the impairment charge resulted from conversion offers from the issuers of these securities at prices well below the stated redemption value of the preferred shares these securities which had a cost basis of 42 million were written down to their fair value of 25 million as of june 30 2009 resulting in an otherthantemporary impairment of 17 million 

during the third quarter of 2008 we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the federal national mortgage association “fnma” and the federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” the impairment resulted from actions by the us treasury department and the federal housing finance agency to place fnma and fhlmc under conservatorship additionally we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by lehman brothers inc which declared bankruptcy during the third quarter of 2008 the total of these creditrelated impairment losses was 23 million 

interest expense 

excluding the currency remeasurement charge the 2009 decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 

  

the 2008 increase in interest expense was largely due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt in early 2008 we completed the issuance of 40 billion in longterm debt the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the 61 billion central states pension fund withdrawal payment in december 2007 the impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated however by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states throughout 2008 

income tax expense 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

income tax expense declined primarily due to lower pretax income the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges described previously which were not deductible for tax purposes and resulted in the effective tax rate increasing by 41 

2008 compared to 2007 

income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pretax income pretax income in 2007 was adversely impacted by the central states withdrawal charge as noted previously the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the central states withdrawal charge in 2007 these factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in 2008 and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in 2008 being subject to tax in the united states whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in 2007 was subject to tax outside the united states where effective tax rates are generally lower the effective tax rate in 2008 was also 41 higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the goodwill and intangible impairment charges discussed previously 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2007 to 2009 time period however in 2007 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund as previously discussed in 2009 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the decline in profitability for our three reporting segments however the impact of this decline was partially offset by reduced working capital needs most of the remaining variability in our operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in pension contributions and the timing of income tax payments the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our operating cash flows in millions 

 

   

 

 contributions to our companysponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans the increase in contributions in 2009 was largely due to minimum funding requirements related to the ups ibt pension plan as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan during the 2007 to 2009 period we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans 

the central states pension fund withdrawal payment was made in december 2007 and significantly impacted operating cash flow the payment was deductible for us federal and state income tax purposes and we therefore received cash tax benefits in the form of refunds or lower estimated payments during 2008 and 2007 the impact of the central states pension fund withdrawal payment on our cash flow from operations was as follows in millions 

 

 investing activities 

our primary uses of cash flows for investing activities were for capital expenditures as follows amounts in millions 

 

 we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations in 2009 we reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our current anticipated operating needs future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors including economic and industry conditions 

  

capital expenditures on buildings and facilities primarily resulted from our worldport hub expansion as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe canada and china in 2009 we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion which increased the sorting capacity by 15 the final phase of the worldport expansion will be completed in 2010 and will increase sorting capacity approximately 20 more in 2008 we opened our new international air hub in shanghai china and also began construction of our new intraasia air hub in shenzhen china which became operational in february 2010 

capital spending on aircraft over the 2007 to 2009 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing 767300 and 747400 and md11 aircraft capital spending on vehicles was primarily for replacement assets in our package delivery and ltl operations we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2010 will be approximately 18 billion 

the net change in finance receivables is primarily due to customer paydowns and new loan origination activity primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 

other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300 and boeing 747400 aircraft orders and changes in restricted cash balances we maintain an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our selfinsurance obligations and we deposited 95 and 191 million in cash collateral with the insurance carrier under this agreement during 2009 and 2008 respectively we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of 117 208 and 140 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

financing activities 

our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares pay cash dividends and repay debt principal as follows amounts in millions except per share data 

 

   

as a result of the uncertain economic environment we have slowed our share repurchase activity we currently intend to repurchase shares in 2010 at a rate that should approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs in january 2008 the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 100 billion share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in 2008 the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration as in past years this dividend was payable the following january as a result a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008 in february 2010 we increased our quarterly dividend payment from 045 to 047 per share 

in 2007 we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the 61 billion withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters in 2008 we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a 40 billion senior fixed rate notes offering as well as an 850 million us federal tax refund received in 2009 we completed an additional 20 billion senior fixed rate notes offering 

other than commercial paper repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations redemption of facilities bonds and certain tranches of ups notes and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

other financing activities include certain hedging activities and cash received from common stock issuances to employees in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2009 and 2008 we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings which resulted in cash outflows of 243 and 84 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to 100 billion under our us commercial paper program as of december 31 2009 we had 672 million of commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 010 and a weighted average maturity of 17 days the amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2010 is expected to fluctuate we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december 31 2009 

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of 30 billion and expires on april 15 2010 interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90day libor plus a percentage determined by quotations for our 1year credit default swap spread subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard  poor’s and moody’s if our public debt ratings are a  a2 or above the minimum applicable margin is 100 and the maximum applicable margin is 200 if our public debt ratings are lower than a  a2 the minimum applicable margin is 150 and the maximum applicable margin is 300 

the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of 10 billion and expires on april 19 2012 interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points at december 31 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities 

  

in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities 

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants as of december 31 2009 and for all prior periods presented we have satisfied these financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur and limit the amount of attributable debt in saleleaseback transactions to 10 of net tangible assets as of december 31 2009 10 of net tangible assets is equivalent to 2296 billion however we have no covered saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding additionally we are required to maintain a minimum net worth as defined of 50 billion on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2009 our net worth as defined was equivalent to 12757 billion we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2009 the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts as of december 31 2009 we maintain orders for 25 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2010 and 2014 and 2 boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2010 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters as well as the ups retirement plan and the ups pension plan these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the 

  

consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above additionally we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond 2014 because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 

we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in 2010 in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 

the contractual payments due for “other liabilities” primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 266 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities recognized and unrecognized tax benefits are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 1973 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2009 we had 501 million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2009 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 761 million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

contingencies 

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which was certified as a class action in a california federal court in september 2004 plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1300 fulltime supervisors in august 2005 the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims and plaintiffs appealed the ruling in october 2007 the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling in april 2008 the court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for that month we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc centers and the ups store locations these lawsuits relate to the rebranding of mail boxes etc centers to the ups store the ups store business model the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises and ups’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories in one of the actions which is pending in california state court the court certified a class consisting of all mail boxes etc branded stores that rebranded to the ups store in march 2003 we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in january 2008 a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging pricefixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services ups was not named in this case on july 21 2009 the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the 60 defendants named in the amended complaint we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in barber auto sales v ups which a federal court in alabama certified as a class action in september 2009 the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from ups’s assessment of shipping charge corrections when ups determines that the “dimensional weight” of packages is greater than reported by the shipper we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction most us state and local jurisdictions and many nonus jurisdictions we have substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 2003 during the third quarter of 2009 we received a refund of 271 million as a result of the resolution of tax years 1999 through 2002 with the internal revenue service “irs” appeals office for the tax years 2003 through 2004 we anticipate concluding the limited number of unagreed issues with the irs appeals office by the end of the second quarter of 2010 along with the audit for tax years 2005 through 2007 the irs is currently examining nonincome based taxes including employment and excise taxes which could lead to proposed assessments the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment we anticipate receipt of the irs reports on these matters by the end of the second quarter of 2010 we have filed all required us state and local returns reporting the result of the resolution of the us federal income tax audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002 a limited number of us state and local matters are the subject of ongoing audits administrative appeals or litigation 

at this time we do not expect any of the above tax matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 254000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood 

  

of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2013 we have approximately 2800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which becomes amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable in november 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 in october 2006 in addition the majority approximately 3400 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” in june of 2009 we reached a new agreement with the iam which was subsequently ratified in july 2009 the new agreement runs through july 31 2014 

other matters 

we received grand jury subpoenas from the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” regarding the doj’s investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in july 2006 and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december 2007 

in october 2007 june 2008 and february 2009 we received information requests from the european commission “commission” relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry and subsequently responded to each request on february 9 2010 ups received a statement of objections by the commission this document contains the commission’s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by 18 freight forwarders including ups the statement of objections enables the addressees to respond although it alleges anticompetitive behavior it does not prejudge the commission’s final decision as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding 

we also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions 

we are cooperating with each of these inquiries 

at this time we are unable to determine the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting standards 

provisions within the following accounting standards were adopted during the years covered by these financial statements 

financial instruments the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance in february 2007 that gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie the fair value option on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings additionally this guidance allowed for a onetime election for existing positions upon adoption with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings we adopted this standard on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method accordingly we recorded a 16 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 these investments are reported in “other noncurrent assets” on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

compensationretirement benefits we previously utilized the early measurement date option available in accounting for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans and we measured the funded status of our plans as of september 30 each year under guidance issued by the fasb we were required to use a december 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008 as a result of this change in measurement date we recorded a cumulative effect aftertax 44 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 

beginning in 2009 new guidance was adopted that required disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan investment policies and strategies major categories of plan assets inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets these disclosures are provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes effective beginning in 2007 guidance issued by the fasb required that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements we adopted this new standard on january 1 2007 and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard was to recognize a 104 million decrease in the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings 

fair value measurements and disclosures the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements that took effect on january 1 2008 and are presented in notes 2 3 4 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements on january 1 2009 we implemented the previously deferred provisions of this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value the accounting requirements for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying transactions that are not orderly contained the fasb’s guidance were adopted on april 1 2009 but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

derivatives and hedging the fasb issued certain disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging transactions that took effect on january 1 2009 and are presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

business combinations the fasb issued new accounting requirements for business combinations which took effect on january 1 2009 this new guidance was applied to business combinations completed in 2009 but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

consolidation the fasb issued accounting and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests which took effect on january 1 2009 however this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 

accounting standards issued but not yet effective 

other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december 31 2009 are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

contingencies 

as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2009 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2009 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment 

we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding  logistics ups freight mbe  ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st for each reporting unit the impairment test involves a twostep process first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this impairment charge resulted from several factors including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance as well as expand service offerings however this process took longer than initially anticipated and thus financial results had been below our expectations additionally the ltl sector in 2008 had been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us lower industrial production and retail sales volatile fuel prices and significant 

  

levels of pricebased competition by the fourth quarter of 2008 the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit leading to the goodwill impairment charge 

none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008 nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2009 or 2007 changes in our forecasts could cause book values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october 1 2009 would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity based on recent performance and nearterm projections the value assigned to the customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with the acquired business accordingly an intangible asset impairment charge of 27 million was recorded for the year ended december 31 2008 no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008 nor were any such impairments recognized in 2009 or 2007 

selfinsurance accruals 

we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

fair value measurements 

in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities 

  

pension assets and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

pension and postretirement medical benefits 

as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain several singleemployer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rates of compensation increase expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable and represent our best estimates based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company’s costs and obligations for the year 2009 in millions 

 

 depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets 

as of december 31 2009 we had 17979 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our 

  

maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

in 2008 we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl’s express deferred and international package volume within the united states as well as air transportation services between the united states canada and mexico in early april 2009 ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services additionally our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services as a result of these factors the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 

based on the factors noted above as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnelldouglas dc871 and dc873 aircraft fleets we conducted an impairment analysis as of march 31 2009 and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft based on anticipated residual values for the airframes engines and parts we recognized an impairment charge of 181 million in the first quarter of 2009 the dc8 fleets were subsequently retired from service 

as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007 including capacityoptimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses the review was completed in march 2007 and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing 727 and 747 aircraft and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of 221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

  

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was 138 and 155 million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 254 277 and 225 million respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts options and swaps a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we periodically use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices as of december 31 2009 and 2008 however we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 87 million in cash this transaction was reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting were designated as hedges and maintained their effectiveness the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges which extended through the first quarter of 2009 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months additionally we utilize crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations the term of these swap agreements is commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates 

we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period 

we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest additionally we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

  

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 

credit risk 

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default 

sensitivity analysis 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 

there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions additionally changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 

 

  

  the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in “critical accounting policies and estimates” the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates respectively was not material as of december 31 2009 or 2008 the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december 31 2009 or 2008

our primary business is the timedefinite delivery of packages and documents worldwide in recent years we have extended our service portfolio to include global supply chain services and lessthantruckload transportation primarily in the us we report our operations in three segments us domestic package operations international package operations and supply chain  freight operations 

 

  

  

 transportation and infrastructure we operate a ground fleet of approximately 107000 vehicles which reaches all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous us we also operate an air fleet of about 570 aircraft the ninth largest airline in the world our primary air hub is in louisville ky regional air hubs are located in columbia sc dallas tx hartford ct ontario ca philadelphia pa and rockford il our largest international air hub is in cologne germany with other regional international hubs in miami fl canada hong kong singapore taiwan china and the philippines 

we have established a global transportation infrastructure and a comprehensive portfolio of services we support these services with advanced operational and customerfacing technology our supply chain solutions enable customers’ inventory to move more effectively as a consequence they can concentrate on their own core competencies 

outlook we believe that the following trends will allow us to continue to grow our business over the long term 

 

  

  

   

our vision for the future is to synchronize the world of commerce addressing the complexities of our customers’ supply chain needs our goal is to develop business solutions that create value and competitive advantages for our customers enabling them to achieve supply chain efficiencies better customer service for their customers and improved cash flow 

operations 

we believe that our integrated global network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through one integrated pickup and delivery service system 

us domestic package 

the us business consists of air and ground delivery of small packages—up to 150 pounds in weight—and letters to and from all 50 states it also provides guaranteed timedefinite delivery of certain heavyweight packages substantially all of our us small package delivery services are guaranteed 

this business is built on an integrated air and ground pickup and delivery network we believe that this model improves productivity and asset utilization and provides the flexibility to transport packages using the most reliable and costeffective transportation mode or combination of modes 

in 2006 we made the most significant upgrade ever to our us ground package delivery network accelerating the transit times for more than a halfmillion packages nationwide by one day or more additional lane enhancements were introduced in february 2008 

we believe that our broad product portfolio reliable package delivery service experienced and dedicated employees and unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling services to our large and diverse customer base to control costs through effective network modification and limited expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

international package 

the international package segment provides air and ground delivery of small packages and letters to more than 200 countries and territories around the world export services cross country boundaries domestic services move shipments within a country’s borders ups’s global presence grew out of its highly refined us domestic business 

 

  

  

  

 we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades some of our recent acquisitions and investments include the following 

 

   

  

  

  

 growth in asia is being driven by global demand which is stimulating improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region particularly in china and india over the last few years ups has steadily increased air service between the us and asia 

 

  

  

  

 the international package delivery market has been growing at a faster rate than that of the us and our international package operations have historically been growing faster than the market we plan to use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services we will also implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations we believe that both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for longterm growth 

supply chain  freight segment 

the supply chain  freight segment consists of our forwarding and logistics capabilities as well as our ups freight business unit 

in today’s global economy companies’ supply chains are growing increasingly complex as shown in diagram 1 below many of our customers large and small have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to improve service to support new business models and to strengthen their balance sheets 

  

this increasing complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade services with financial and information services we believe that we can capitalize on this opportunity because 

 

  

  

  

  

 ups freight is an ltl service which offers a full range of regional interregional and longhaul ltl capabilities in all 50 states canada puerto rico guam the virgin islands and mexico this business also offers a tl service 

our growth strategy is to increase the number of customers benefiting from repeatable supply chain solutions particularly in the healthcare high tech and retail sectors and to increase the amount of small package transportation from these customers we intend to leverage our small package and freight customers through crossselling the full complement of ups services 

  

products and services 

our goal is to provide our customers with easytouse products and services we seek to streamline their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their own business processes helping them create supply chain efficiencies better serve their customers and improve their cash flows these products and services support ltl and air freight shipments as well as small package transportation ups offers a variety of technology solutions for automated shipping visibility and billing we believe we have the most comprehensive suite of such services in the industry 

global small package our global small package portfolio consists of a spectrum of export and domestic services export services are those provided for packages crossing a country’s borders while domestic services are for packages that stay within the borders of a single country we provide domestic services in 23 major countries outside the united states this portfolio includes guaranteed delivery options to major cities around the world we handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth we offer sameday pickup of air and ground packages we also offer worldwide customs clearance service for any mode of transportation

 us domestic package operations 

2008 compared to 2007 

us domestic package revenue increased 293 million or 09 for the year largely due to a 30 improvement in revenue per piece partially offset by a 20 decrease in average daily package volume 

next day air volume deferred air volume and ground volume declined 71 28 and 14 respectively for the year primarily as a result of the current us recession these declining volume trends worsened through the year with next day air deferred air and ground volume declining 86 35 and 21 respectively during the fourth quarter relatively high energy costs during most of the year combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors adversely affected the small package market which places additional pressure on our domestic package volume 

the increase in overall revenue per piece of 30 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect during the first quarter and higher fuel surcharge rates but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix next day air and deferred revenue per piece increased 48 and 18 respectively and were positively impacted by the base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products discussed further below this increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights a mix shift toward lower yielding products and hedging losses ground revenue per piece increased 39 mainly due to the rate increase as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate due to increased diesel fuel prices in 2008 compared with 2007 

on november 9 2007 we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on december 31 2007 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and an increase of 010 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 

we also modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 this fuel surcharge continues to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 2517 in 2008 an increase from the 1217 in 2007 due to the significant increase in jet fuel prices in early and mid2008 but partially offset by the 2 reduction in the index the ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products increased to 797 in 2008 from 430 in 2007 due to significantly higher diesel fuel prices in early and mid2008 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue net of the impact of hedging losses increased by 1119 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above but partially offset by the decline in volume for our air and ground products 

us domestic package operating profit increased 5438 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by a charge to withdraw from the central states southeast and southwest 

  

areas pension fund “central states pension fund” an aircraft impairment and a special voluntary separation opportunity “svso” charge all discussed further in the “operating expenses” section which reduced domestic operating profit by 6100 billion 159 million and 53 million respectively the absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods 

operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by the current us recession lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume lower average package weights and a shift in product mix away from our premium services partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments because of this time lag fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008 which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007 when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted 

2007 compared to 2006 

us domestic package revenue increased 529 million or 17 in 2007 due to a 16 improvement in revenue per piece and a 04 increase in average daily package volume next day air volume increased 08 and ground volume increased 06 for the year largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter when our next day air volume rose 22 and ground volume increased 15 deferred air volume declined 19 in 2007 our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing us economy and weak small package market in 2007 trends in us industrial production and businesstoconsumer shipments in 2007 were not favorable to the overall small package market which places pressure on our domestic package volume 

the increase in overall revenue per piece of 16 in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix next day air revenue per piece declined 09 and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our loweryielding next day air saver products deferred revenue per piece increased only 04 the change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate discussed further below ground revenue per piece increased 29 primarily due to the rate increase but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006 overall product mix reduced revenue per piece as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 06 

consistent with the practice in previous years a rate increase took effect on january 1 2007 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2 nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and a 075 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts 

in january 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 this fuel surcharge continued to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1217 in 2007 a decline from the 1402 in 2006 primarily due to the 2 reduction in the index the ground fuel surcharge rate continued to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 430 in 2007 an increase from 413 in 2006 due to higher diesel fuel prices as a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 110 million in 2007 

us domestic package incurred an operating loss of 1531 billion in 2007 compared with a 4923 billion operating profit in 2006 largely due to a 6100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the central states pension fund additionally domestic package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue 

  

growth the aircraft impairment charge the svso charge and the impact of fuel the aircraft impairment and svso charges reduced domestic operating profit by 159 million and 53 million respectively fuel negatively impacted the change in operating profit during 2007 as fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate these factors were partially offset by cost controls including among other categories lower selfinsurance expense the expense associated with our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors the central states pension fund withdrawal aircraft impairment and svso charges as well as the impact of lower selfinsurance expense are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section 

international package operations 

2008 compared to 2007 

international package revenue improved 1012 billion or 98 for the year driven by a 68 volume increase for our export products and a 61 increase in total revenue per piece the growth in revenue per piece was primarily due to rate increases the impact of currency exchange rates and increased fuel surcharge rates however as the global economic recession deepened throughout the year fourth quarter revenue trended downward compared to the prior year fourth quarter declining 230 million or 80 including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed later 

export volume increased in each region throughout the world in 2008 however volume began to slow in the latter half of 2008 due to difficult worldwide economic conditions intraregional volume continued to experience solid growth especially in europe asian export volume continued to benefit from our geographic service expansion including the connection of several cities to our new air hub in shanghai china export volume growth was negatively impacted by declines in shipments to the us from other regions in the world due to the slowing us economy export volume trends weakened in the latter half of the year due to the severe global economic slowdown with fourth quarter export volume increasing at a much slower rate than what has been experienced over the last several years nonus domestic volume increased 16 for the year and was impacted by volume growth in our domestic businesses in the euro zone and canada but negatively affected by the weak economic conditions in the united kingdom 

export revenue per piece increased 37 for the year largely due to base rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and favorable currency exchange rates but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a shift away from our premium services domestic revenue per piece increased 60 for the year and was affected by rate increases higher fuel surcharge rates and favorable exchange rates total average revenue per piece increased 27 on a currencyadjusted basis and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by 324 million during the year due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity total revenue per piece declined 82 in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar currencyadjusted revenue per piece declined 30 but also impacted by an acceleration in the shift away from our premium services and lower package weights fourth quarter 2008 total segment revenue was negatively impacted by 144 million due to the currency fluctuations net of hedging activity 

on december 31 2007 we increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year 

additionally we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 586 million in 2008 due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 

  

international package operating profit decreased 251 million or 137 in 2008 and the operating margin declined to 140 from 178 in 2007 the decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows such as the reduced import volume into the united states operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network global economic weakness resulted in a weakening operating profit trend with fourth quarter operating profit declining 343 

because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments as a result of this time lag fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008 which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007 when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 136 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates net of hedging activity 

operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter 27 million impairment charge incurred on certain intangible assets in our domestic package business in the united kingdom discussed further in the “operating expenses” section operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by the aircraft impairment and svso charges 62 million of the aircraft impairment charge and 7 million of the svso charge impacted the international package segment and the absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods 

2007 compared to 2006 

international package revenue improved 1192 billion or 131 in 2007 driven by a 104 volume increase for our export products and an 83 increase in total revenue per piece the growth in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the us dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007 but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our us origin international air products 

export volume increased throughout the world asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year especially china asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion as well as strong economic growth which benefits our intraasian package business to continue this expansion we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the us and nagoya japan and began constructing a package and freight air hub in shanghai china that will link shanghai to our international air network with direct service to europe asia and the americas 

european export volume also grew solidly largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the european union us export volume increased at a slower pace nonus domestic volume increased 22 for the year and was impacted by growth in several major european countries and canada 

export revenue per piece increased 39 for the year largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates nonus domestic revenue per piece increased 96 for the year and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates total average revenue per piece increased 27 on a currencyadjusted basis and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by 464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity 

in january 2007 we increased rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year 

  

also in january 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 12 million during the year due to increased volume but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index 

international package operating profit increased 121 million or 71 for the year primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 153 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates net of hedging activity international package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment 62 million and the svso 7 million both of which are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense the adverse impact of the aircraft impairment svso charge and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 178 

supply chain  freight operations 

2008 compared to 2007 

supply chain  freight revenue increased 489 million or 58 for the year forwarding and logistics revenue increased 382 million or 65 for the year primarily due to growth in international air freight north american air freight distribution services and mail services revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges expanded air freight service offerings overall market growth and improved customer retention rates growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business revenue declined by 98 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 2007 as difficult worldwide economic conditions slowing world trade and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics business the overall change in forwarding and logistics revenue was positively affected by 166 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates but was negatively impacted by 58 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 

ups freight increased revenue 83 million or 39 for the year as a result of improved yields and higher fuel surcharge rates but partially offset by a decline in average daily ltl shipments average ltl shipments per day decreased 46 during the year reflecting the weak ltl market in the united states in 2008 as compared with 2007 however ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 73 for the year due to an increase in base rates in 2008 and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher diesel prices the weak us ltl market declined further in the fourth quarter of 2008 which led to a revenue decline of 41 million or 78 from the comparable quarter of 2007 fourth quarter average ltl shipments per day decreased 82 with ltl revenue per hundredweight declining 24 partially due to declining fuel surcharge rates 

in january 2008 ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging 54 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada the increase became effective on february 4 2008 and applies to minimum charge ltl and tl rates 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business and our financial business increased revenue by 59 during the year this revenue growth was impacted by increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment decreased by 383 million for the year primarily due to a 548 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter in the ups freight business unit as discussed further in the “operating expenses” section operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics business primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 12 million in 2008 due to favorable currency exchange rates 

  

operating profit for this segment was negatively impacted in 2007 by 8 million due to the svso charge and by 46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain noncore business units in france as discussed further in the “operating expenses” section the absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods 

2007 compared to 2006 

supply chain  freight revenue increased 424 million or 53 in 2007 forwarding and logistics revenue increased 230 million or 40 for the year and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006 favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by 178 million during the year revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates 

ups freight increased revenue 156 million or 80 for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume average ltl shipments per day increased 83 during the year driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 93 during the year due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higheryielding customer segments the increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 75 decrease for the year in the ltl weight per shipment 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business our financial business and our us domestic cargo operations increased revenue by 103 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment was 278 million in 2007 compared with a profit of 2 million in 2006 resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin this improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls a focus on asset utilization and revenue management initiatives cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006 which included a reduction of nonoperating staff of approximately 1400 people additionally margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft finally revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets 

operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by 46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain noncore business units in france as well as by 8 million due to the svso charge these charges are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by 18 million in 2007 

operating expenses 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated operating expenses decreased by 3010 billion or 61 for the year primarily due to a reduction in compensation and benefits expense currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments accounted for approximately 342 million of increased operating expenses from 2007 to 2008 

compensation and benefits expense decreased by 5682 billion or 179 for the year and was impacted by several items the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in pension expense for our multiemployer pension plans largely relating to a 6100 billion charge in 2007 to withdraw from the central states pension 

  

fund partially offsetting this was a 216 million increase in expense for upssponsored pension plans in the us which was impacted by expense recognition now being required for the new ups ibt pension plan nonpension benefits expense increased largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs which is impacted by medical cost inflation employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our nonunion employees compensation and benefits expense also declined due to the absence in 2008 of the svso and france restructuring charges which had increased compensation and benefits expense by 68 and 42 million in 2007 respectively 

the 32 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense the 40 increase in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors including higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles resulting from new deliveries but partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects the 110 increase in purchased transportation was driven by a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses the impact of currency exchange rates and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by thirdparty carriers the 390 increase in fuel expense was impacted by higher prices for jeta fuel diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains the 72 increase in other occupancy expense was influenced by higher electricity and natural gas costs as well as higher rent and property tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2008 declining energy prices impacted costs such as purchased transportation which decreased 132 million or 76 and fuel which decreased 118 million or 127 compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 

other expenses increased 149 for the year primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in addition we also experienced increased expenses for leased transportation equipment data processing advertising professional services and bad debts these factors were partially offset by the absence in 2008 of a 221 million aircraft impairment charge recorded in 2007 

we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 st  on a reporting unit basis in accordance with fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding  logistics ups freight mbe  ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment the impairment test involves a twostep process first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values including goodwill is performed we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this impairment charge resulted from several factors including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance as well as expand service offerings however this process took longer than initially anticipated and thus financial results have been below our expectations additionally the ltl sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us lower industrial production and retail sales volatile fuel prices and significant levels of pricebased competition by the fourth quarter of 2008 the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit leading to the goodwill impairment charge none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008 nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006 

  

as a result of weak performance in our domestic package operations in the united kingdom we reviewed our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity based on recent performance and nearterm projections the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business accordingly an intangible asset impairment charge of 27 million was recorded for the year ended december 31 2008 

2007 compared to 2006 

consolidated operating expenses increased by 8202 billion or 200 in 2007 compared with 2006 currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by 471 million for the year 

compensation and benefits expense increased by 7324 billion for the year and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the central states pension fund higher wage rates in the union workforce increased stockbased compensation higher expense for union pension and welfare programs the svso charge and the restructuring charge in our supply chain  freight business in france these increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense 

our national master agreement with the teamsters allowed us upon ratification to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed singleemployer plan for this group “ups ibt pension plan” upon ratification of the contract in december 2007 and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund we recorded a pretax 6100 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability and made a december 2007 payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 

the withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the central states pension fund in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” we negotiated our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as part of our national master agreement with the teamsters which included other modifications to hourly wage rates healthcare and pension benefits and work rules we sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges and would present a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participated in the fund we believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to ups teamster employees through the new ups ibt pension plan as the ups ibt pension plan matures we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the central states pension fund 

in december 2006 we offered the svso to approximately 640 employees who work in nonoperating functions this program was established to improve the efficiency of nonoperating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company the svso ended in february 2007 and 195 or 30 of eligible employees accepted the offer as a result we recorded a charge to expense of 68 million in the first quarter of 2007 to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 

in the third quarter of 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program which was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in france in 

  

july 2007 employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase these severance benefits were formuladriven and were in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements we recorded a restructuring charge of 46 million 42 million related to severance costs and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense in 2007 related to this program 

stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense increased 113 million or 177 during 2007 primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options restricted performance units and restricted stock units pension and healthcare expense increased during the year largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees but was somewhat offset by a 59 million decrease in expense for the upssponsored pension plans in the us 

the expense associated with our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities was 46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006 insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies improved oversight and management of claims improved trends in health care costs and favorable state legislative reforms 

the 02 increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings the 02 decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles the 74 increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our international package business and currency fluctuations as well as growth in our international forwarding business the 120 increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel as well as higher usage but was partially mitigated by hedging gains other occupancy expense increased 21 for the year and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes but partially offset by lower utilities expense the 30 increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a 221 million aircraft impairment charge discussed further below but partially offset with cost controls in several areas the comparison in other expenses was also affected by an 87 million charge to settle class action litigation in 2006 

as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007 including capacityoptimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses the review was completed in march 2007 and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing 727 and 747 aircraft and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of 221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007 this charge is included in the caption “other expenses” in the statement of consolidated income of which 159 million impacted our us domestic package segment and 62 million impacted our international package segment 

investment income and interest expense 

2008 compared to 2007 

the decrease in investment income of 24 million was primarily due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments investment impairment charges and a lower yield earned on our investments during 2008 we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the federal national mortgage association “fnma” and the federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” the impairment followed actions by the us treasury department and the federal housing 

  

finance agency with respect to fnma and fhlmc additionally we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by lehman brothers inc which declared bankruptcy during 2008 we do not hold any other securities in any of these entities the total of these creditrelated impairment losses during 2008 was 23 million which was recorded in investment income on the income statement 

interest expense increased 196 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt in early 2008 we completed the issuance of 40 billion in longterm debt the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the 6100 billion central states pension fund withdrawal payment in december 2007 the impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated however by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in shortterm interest rates in the united states throughout 2008 

2007 compared to 2006 

the increase in investment income of 13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments but partially offset by a lower average balance of interestearning investments and increased equitymethod losses on investment partnerships 

interest expense increased 35 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding largely related to commercial paper our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 causing a corresponding increase in interest expense as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund increased interest charges were somewhat offset however by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects including aircraft purchases and our worldport expansion 

income tax expense 

2008 compared to 2007 

income tax expense increased by 1963 billion in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher pretax income pretax income in 2007 was adversely impacted by the central states withdrawal charge as noted previously the effective tax rate was 401 in 2008 compared with 114 in 2007 the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the central states withdrawal charge in 2007 these factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in 2008 and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in 2008 being subject to tax in the united states whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in 2007 was subject to tax outside the united states where effective tax rates are generally lower the effective tax rate in 2008 was also 41 percentage points higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the 548 million goodwill and 27 million intangible impairment charges discussed previously 

2007 compared to 2006 

income tax expense declined by 2259 billion in 2007 compared with 2006 due to lower pretax income primarily resulting from the central states pension fund withdrawal charge the effective tax rate was 114 in 2007 and 355 in 2006 during 2007 our effective tax rate was reduced primarily due to proportionally higher tax credits and the effect of having a relatively larger proportion of our taxable income being earned in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

net income and earnings per share 

2008 compared to 2007 

net income for 2008 was 3003 billion compared with the 382 million achieved in 2007 resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to 294 in 2008 from 036 in 2007 the increase in net income was largely due to the absence in 2008 of some of the previously discussed charges to expense in 2007 in 2007 net 

  

income was negatively impacted by the aftertax impact of the charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund 3772 billion the charge related to the restructuring and disposal of certain logistics operations in france 31 million the aircraft impairment charge 141 million and svso charge 43 million the combination of these four charges reduced 2007 diluted earnings per share by 375 

in 2008 net income was adversely affected by the ups freight goodwill impairment charge 548 million and customer list intangible asset impairment charge in the united kingdom 27 million the combination of these two charges reduced 2008 diluted earnings per share by 056 net income during 2008 was also adversely impacted by the deteriorating worldwide economic situation as previously discussed earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program as the total number of outstanding shares declined by 43 during 2008 

2007 compared to 2006 

net income for 2007 was 382 million a decrease from the 4202 billion achieved in 2006 resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to 036 in 2007 from 386 in 2006 this decrease in net income was largely due to the aftertax 3772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund additionally 2007 net income was adversely impacted by 31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our france supply chain  freight business 141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge and 43 million as a result of the svso charge these items were partially offset by the improved results in our international package and supply chain  freight segments 

the reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal aircraft impairment france restructuring and svso charges noted above these items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by 377 and 375 in 2007 earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program as the total number of outstanding shares declined by 27 during 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8426 1123 and 5589 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in 2008 operating cash flows compared with 2007 was impacted by several items including changes in pension fundings tax payments and refunds and rates for our delivery services 

in 2007 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the 6100 billion payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund total contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans declined in 2008 compared with 2007 even excluding the central states pension fund withdrawal payment as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements total multiemployer pension plan fundings decreased by 473 million in 2008 compared with 2007 excluding the 6100 billion withdrawal charge in 2007 largely due to the lack of contributions to the central states pension fund in 2008 subsequent to our withdrawal additionally contributions to our companysponsored pension and postretirement plans declined by 441 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as we had no material minimum funding requirements in 2008 and we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans as discussed further in the “contractual commitments” section we do have minimum funding requirements in the next several years primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan 

the increase in operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by the timing of tax refunds and estimated tax payments in both 2008 and 2007 in 2008 we received an 850 million us federal tax refund due to prior overpayments of our estimated tax liability primarily resulting from the deductibility of the central states pension fund withdrawal payment for tax purposes additionally the amount of us federal quarterly estimated 

  

income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 also primarily relating to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment as of december 31 2008 we have received substantially all of the expected cash tax benefits resulting from the withdrawal payment 

changes in package volume and pricing affect operating cash flow as noted previously we increased rates in our package delivery and ltl services at the end of 2007 additionally in october 2008 we announced a base rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on january 5 2009 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 59 on ups ground we also increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and an increase of 010 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes these rate changes are customary and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases additionally we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and usorigin international air services by reducing by 2 the index used to determine the fuel surcharge the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

in october 2008 ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging 59 covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada the increase took effect on january 5 2009 and applies to minimum charge ltl and tl rates 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3179 2199 and 2340 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in cash used in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities net purchases sales of marketable securities were 278 621 and 482 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the net sales of marketable securities in 2007 and 2006 were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans as well as to repurchase shares 

capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities as follows in millions 

 

 as described in the “contractual commitments” section below we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations the reduction in capital expenditures was largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in 2008 primarily resulting from our worldport hub expansion as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe canada and china in the fourth quarter of 2008 we opened our new international air hub in shanghai china and also began construction of our new intraasia air hub in shenzhen china 

we had a net cash use of 49 and 39 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively and net cash generation of 68 million in 2006 due to originations sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios 

  

other investing activities reflected a cash outflow of 363 million in 2008 as compared with a 46 million outflow in 2007 and a 120 million cash inflow in 2006 and was impacted by cash settlements of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing 767300 and boeing 747400 aircraft orders and increases in restricted cash balances in 2008 we entered into an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our selfinsurance obligations this agreement required us to provide 191 million in cash collateral to the insurance carrier which is classified as restricted cash within other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts of 208 140 and 233 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

financing activities 

net cash provided by used in financing activities was 6702 2297 and 3851 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares pay cash dividends and make debt principal repayments 

we repaid debt principal net of issuances of 921 million in 2008 compared with net issuances of debt of 6509 billion in 2007 in 2007 we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the 6100 billion withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund commercial paper increased 6575 billion at december 31 2007 over december 31 2006 upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters as previously discussed in 2008 we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a 40 billion senior notes offering as well as the 850 million us federal tax refund received in january 2008 we completed an offering of 1750 billion of 450 senior notes due january 2013 750 million of 550 senior notes due january 2018 and 1500 billion of 620 senior notes due january 2038 all of these notes pay interest semiannually and allow for redemption of the notes by ups at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “makewhole” amount plus accrued interest after pricing and underwriting discounts we received a total of 3961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering concurrent with the issuance these notes we settled certain derivatives that were designated as hedges of the notes offering resulting in a cash outflow of 84 million which is reported in other financing activities on the cash flow statement 

other than commercial paper repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations redemption of certain tranches of ups notes and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships during 2008 we called for the redemption of 327 million of notes issued under our ups notes program and the associated swaps on the notes were terminated we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

in january 2008 we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 5060 funds from operations to total debt in connection with this policy the board of directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 100 billion share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program during 2008 2007 and 2006 we repurchased a total of 536 359 and 326 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 3558 2618 and 2455 billion respectively 3570 2639 and 2460 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements 

our quarterly cash dividends declared were 045 042 and 038 per share in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively additionally in 2008 the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration as in prior years this dividend was payable the following january as a result a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008 this extra dividend payment along with the higher quarterly 

  

dividend per share resulted in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 2219 billion in 2008 from 1703 billion in 2007 and 1577 billion in 2006 the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends on february 11 2009 our board declared a dividend of 045 per share which is payable on march 10 2009 to shareowners of record on february 23 2009 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to 100 billion under our us commercial paper program we had 2922 billion outstanding under this program as of december 31 2008 with an average interest rate of 055 at december 31 2008 we classified 10 billion of our commercial paper as longterm debt on our balance sheet based on our intent and ability to refinance this debt on a longterm basis in the future we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december 31 2008 

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of 45 billion and expires on april 16 2009 the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of 10 billion and expires on april 19 2012 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points at december 31 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 

in addition to these credit facilities we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or longterm debt securities 

as of december 31 2008 our moody’s and standard  poor’s “sp” shortterm credit ratings were p1 and a1 respectively and our moody’s and sp longterm credit ratings were aa2 and aa respectively with a stable outlook from both of these credit rating agencies 

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company and limit the amount of saleleaseback transactions that the company may engage in to 10 of net tangible assets each as of december 31 2008 and for all prior periods we have satisfied these financial covenants as of december 31 2008 10 of net tangible assets is equivalent to 2156 billion however we have no qualifying saleleaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

guarantees and other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

  

contractual commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments pension fundings and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2008 the calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements for debt denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts as of december 31 2008 we maintain orders for 27 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 and five boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2009 and 2010 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters as well as the ups retirement plan and the ups pension plan these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 

as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets our us domestic pension plans experienced a negative return on assets of approximately 26 in 2008 however these losses did not trigger any minimum funding requirement for contributions in 2009 in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan the amount of any minimum funding requirement as applicable for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors including future plan asset returns and discount rates a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 

the contractual payments due under the “other liabilities” column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 388 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 48 

  

“accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin 48 we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities fin 48 is discussed further in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 2132 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances and as of december 31 2008 we had 262 million of surety bonds written as of december 31 2008 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 885 million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

contingencies 

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which was certified as a class action in a california federal court in june 2004 plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1300 fulltime supervisors in august 2005 the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims and plaintiff appealed the ruling in october 2007 the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling in april 2008 the court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for april 29 2008 we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in another case hohider v ups which in july 2007 was certified as a class action in a pennsylvania federal court plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the americans with disabilities act plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35000 current and former employees and seek backpay and compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys’ fees in august 2007 the third circuit court of appeals granted the company’s petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s certification order oral argument took place in november 2008 the appeal will likely take one year we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and mail boxes etc inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc centers and the ups store locations these lawsuits relate to the rebranding of mail boxes etc centers to the ups store the ups store business model the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises and ups’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups freight along with several other companies involved in the ltl freight business is a defendant in a multidistrict litigation pending in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia the lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates and they seek injunctive relief treble damages and attorneys’ fees we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously 

  

defend ourselves in these cases and defendants’ motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the court these cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction most us state and local jurisdictions and many nonus jurisdictions as of december 31 2008 we had substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 1999 in february and july 2008 the internal revenue service “irs” completed its audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002 and tax years 2003 through 2004 respectively with only a limited number of issues that will be considered by the irs appeals office by the end of 2009 in late 2008 the irs began the initial planning phase of the income tax audit for tax years 2005 through 2007 along with this audit for tax years 2005 through 2007 the irs is currently examining nonincome based taxes including employment and excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases which could lead to proposed assessments the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment however we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity with few exceptions we are no longer subject to us state and local and nonus income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 1999 but certain us state and local matters are subject to ongoing litigation 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 260000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in september 2007 we reached a new national master agreement with the teamsters which was ratified in december 2007 the new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement took effect on august 1 2008 with the exception of our withdrawal from the central states pension fund which occurred in 2007 we have approximately 2900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which becomes amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable in november 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 in october 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers approximately 3000 these agreements run through july 31 2009 

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

other matters

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

contingencies —as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas 5 evaluation we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas 5 these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas 5 excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2008 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2008 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill and intangible impairment —we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units our reporting units are comprised of the europe asia and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding  logistics ups freight mbe  ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain  freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1 st for each reporting unit the impairment test involves a twostep process first a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies as applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our business strategy government regulations or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods if impairment indicators are present in future periods the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in 2005 had a goodwill impairment of 548 million this impairment charge resulted from several factors including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance as well as 

  

expand service offerings however this process took longer than initially anticipated and thus financial results have been below our expectations additionally the ltl sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us lower industrial production and retail sales volatile fuel prices and significant levels of pricebased competition by the fourth quarter of 2008 the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit leading to the goodwill impairment charge none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008 nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006 

all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finitelived intangibles and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “fas 144” impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on a dcf model as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity based on recent performance and nearterm projections the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business accordingly an intangible asset impairment charge of 27 million was recorded for the year ended december 31 2008 no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008 nor were any such impairments recognized in 2007 or 2006 

selfinsurance accruals —we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

pension and postretirement medical benefits —as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than 

  

pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable and represent our best estimates based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company’s costs and obligations for the year 2008 in millions 

 

 fair value measurements —in the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk including derivatives marketable securities finance receivables other investments and debt certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivatives marketable securities and certain other investments fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy in accordance with fas 157 level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rates and yield curves level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability 

  

the following is a general description of the valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 

derivative contracts —our foreign currency interest rate and energy derivatives are largely comprised of overthecounter derivatives which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves currency exchange rates and commodity forward prices and therefore are classified as level 2 

marketable securities —marketable securities utilizing level 1 inputs include active exchangetraded equity securities and equity index funds and most us government debt securities as these securities all have quoted prices in active markets marketable securities utilizing level 2 inputs include nonauction rate assetbacked securities corporate bonds and municipal bonds these securities are valued using market corroborated pricing matrix pricing or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves 

we have classified our auction rate securities portfolio as utilizing level 3 inputs as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities these valuations may be revised in future periods as market conditions evolve these securities were valued as of december 31 2008 considering several factors including the credit quality of the securities the rate of interest received since the failed auctions began the yields of securities similar to the underlying auction rate securities and the input of brokerdealers in these securities 

other investments —financial assets and liabilities utilizing level 3 inputs include our holdings in certain investment partnerships these partnership holdings do not have any quoted prices nor can they be valued using inputs based on observable market data these investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model based on each partnership’s financial statements and cash flow projections 

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets —as of december 31 2008 we had 18265 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

in accordance with the provisions of fas 144 we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

we continually monitor our aircraft fleet utilization in light of current and projected volume levels aircraft fuel prices and other factors changes in any of these factors including a continuation of the rapid economic 

  

decline experienced in the second half of 2008 could result in modifications to our current aircraft fleet plan such modifications could result in a reduction in the expected useful life of an aircraft type or in impairment losses related to the early retirement of particular aircraft 

as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007 including capacityoptimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses the review was completed in march 2007 and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing 727 and 747 aircraft and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of 221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007 

during 2006 we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing 757 boeing 767 and airbus a300 fleets and as a result of this evaluation increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30 to 10 of original cost this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 

income taxes —we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the first quarter of 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of sfas no 109” “fin 48” and related guidance see note 13 in the consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

accounts receivable —we utilize the reserve method for recognizing bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable this requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions trends in customer payment frequency and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations 

  

of risk continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was 155 and 163 million respectively our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was 277 225 and 159 million respectively 

forwardlooking statements 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and other parts of this report contain “forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “we see” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled  

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was an asset liability of 0 and 179 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 0 and 42 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 87 million in cash additionally in the second quarter of 2006 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 229 million in cash these transactions are reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting were designated as hedges and maintained their effectiveness the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges the hedges that were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be recognized in the income statement through the first quarter of 2009 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of 241 and 42 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 239 and 387 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this sensitivity analysis 

  

assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december 31 2008 and 2007 was a liability of 388 and 94 million respectively 

our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances at december 31 2008 and 2007 would be approximately 41 and 100 million respectively 

we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2008 and 2007 would be approximately 6 and 15 million respectively 

additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2008 and 2007 would be immaterial 

this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2008 and 2007 the fair value of such investments was 30 and 35 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 3 and 4 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 

credit risk 

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default

 item 1 business tableend overview 

united parcel service inc “ups” is the world’s largest package delivery company a leader in the us lessthantruckload industry and a global leader in supply chain management we were founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in seattle washington today we deliver packages each business day for 18 million shipping customers to 61 million consignees in over 200 countries and territories in 2007 we delivered an average of 1575 million pieces per day worldwide or a total of 397 billion packages total revenue in 2007 was 497 billion 

our primary business is the timedefinite delivery of packages and documents worldwide in recent years we have extended our service portfolio to include lessthantruckload transportation primarily in the us and supply chain services we report our operations in three segments us domestic package operations international package operations and supply chain  freight operations 

 

  

  

 transportation and infrastructure we operate a ground fleet approximately 100000 vehicles which reaches all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous us we also operate an air fleet of about 600 aircraft the ninth largest airline in the world our primary air hub is in louisville ky regional air hubs are located in columbia sc dallas tx hartford ct ontario ca philadelphia pa and rockford il our largest international air hub is in cologne germany with other regional international hubs in hong kong singapore taiwan miami fl and pampanga philippines 

we have established a global transportation infrastructure and a comprehensive portfolio of services we support these services with advanced operational and customerfacing technology our supply chain solutions enable customers’ inventory to move more effectively as a consequence they can concentrate on their own core competencies 

outlook we believe that the following trends will allow us to continue to grow our business 

 

  

  

   

our vision for the future is to synchronize the world of commerce addressing the complexities of our customers’ supply chain needs our goal is to develop business solutions that create value and competitive advantages for our customers enabling them to achieve supply chain efficiencies better customer service for their customers and improved cash flow 

operations 

we believe that our integrated global network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service air ground domestic international commercial residential through one integrated pickup and delivery service system 

us domestic package 

the us business consists of air and ground delivery of small packages—up to 150 pounds in weight—and letters to and from all 50 states it also provides guaranteed timedefinite delivery of certain heavyweight packages substantially all of our us small package delivery services are guaranteed 

this business is built on an integrated air and ground pickup and delivery network we believe that this model improves productivity and asset utilization and provides the flexibility to transport packages using the most reliable and costeffective transportation mode or combination of modes 

in 2006 we made the most significant upgrade ever to our us ground package delivery network accelerating the transit times for more than a halfmillion packages nationwide by one day or more additional lane enhancements were introduced in february 2008 

we believe that our broad product portfolio reliable package delivery service experienced and dedicated employees and unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling services to our large and diverse customer base to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

international package 

the international package segment provides air and ground delivery of small packages and letters to 200 countries and territories around the world export services cross country boundaries domestic services move shipments within a country’s borders ups’s global presence grew out of its highly refined us domestic business 

 

  

  

 we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades some of our recent acquisitions and investments include the following 

 

   

  

 growth in asia is being driven by global demand which is stimulating improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region particularly in china and india over the last few years ups has steadily increased air service between the us and asia 

 

  

  

  

 the international package delivery market has been growing at a faster rate than that of the us and our international package operations have historically been growing faster than the market we plan to use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services we will also implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations we believe that both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for growth 

supply chain  freight segment 

the supply chain  freight segment consists of our forwarding and logistics capabilities as well as our freight business unit 

in recent years we extended our service portfolio into heavy air and ground forwarding through two acquisitions in 2005 we acquired menlo worldwide forwarding which forms the basis for our timedefinite guaranteed air forwarding service in the same year we acquired overnite corp a ltl service which offers a full range of regional interregional and longhaul ltl capabilities in all 50 states canada puerto rico guam the virgin islands and mexico overnite corp was rebranded as ups freight in 2006 

in today’s global economy companies’ supply chains are growing increasingly complex as shown in diagram 1 below many of our customers large and small have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to improve service to support new business models and to strengthen their balance sheets 

  

this increasing complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade services with financial and information services we believe that we can capitalize on this opportunity because 

 

  

  

  

  

 our growth strategy is to increase the number of customers benefiting from configurable supply chain solutions and to increase the amount of small package transportation from these customers we intend to leverage our small package and freight customers through crossselling the full complement of ups services 

products and services 

our goal is to provide our customers with easytouse products and services we seek to streamline their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their own business processes helping them create supply chain efficiencies better serve their customers and improve their cash flows these products and services support ltl and air freight shipments as well as small package transportation ups offers a variety of technology solutions for automated shipping visibility and billing we believe we have the most comprehensive suite of such services in the industry 

  

global small package our global small package portfolio consists of air and ground services for package delivery to over 200 countries providing delivery within onetotwo business days to the world’s major business centers we offer a spectrum of export and domestic services export services are those provided for packages crossing a country’s borders while domestic services are for packages that stay within the borders of a single country we provide domestic services in 23 major countries outside the united states this portfolio includes guaranteed delivery options to major cities around the world we handle packages that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth we offer sameday pickup of air and ground packages we also offer worldwide customs clearance service for any mode of transportation

 us domestic package operations 

2007 compared to 2006 

us domestic package revenue increased 529 million or 17 in 2007 due to a 16 improvement in revenue per piece and a 04 increase in average daily package volume next day air volume increased 08 and ground volume increased 06 for the year largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter when our next day air volume rose 22 and ground volume increased 15 deferred air volume declined 19 in 2007 our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing us economy and weak small package market in 2007 trends in us industrial production and businesstoconsumer shipments in 2007 have not been favorable to the overall small package market which places pressure on our domestic package volume 

the increase in overall revenue per piece of 16 in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix next day air revenue per piece declined 09 and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our loweryielding next day air saver products deferred revenue per piece increased only 04 the change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate discussed further below ground revenue per piece increased 29 primarily due to the rate increase but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006 overall product mix reduced revenue per piece as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 06 

consistent with the practice in previous years a rate increase took effect on january 1 2007 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2 nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and a 075 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts 

in january 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 this fuel surcharge continues to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1217 in 2007 a decline from the 1402 in 2006 primarily due to the 2 reduction in the index the ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 430 in 2007 an increase from 413 in 2006 due to higher diesel fuel prices as a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by 110 million in 2007 

us domestic package incurred an operating loss of 1531 billion in 2007 compared with a 4923 billion operating profit in 2006 largely due to a 6100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund “central states pension fund” additionally domestic package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue growth an aircraft impairment charge and a special voluntary separation opportunity “svso” charge the aircraft impairment and svso charges reduced domestic operating profit by 159 million and 53 million respectively these factors were partially offset by cost controls including among other categories lower selfinsurance expense the expense associated with our selfinsurance 

  

accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors the central states pension fund withdrawal aircraft impairment and svso charges as well as the impact of lower selfinsurance expense are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section 

2006 compared to 2005 

us domestic package revenue increased 1846 billion or 65 for the year with average daily package volume up 44 volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid us economy strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005 due to slower overall economic growth in the us and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter 

pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 25 for the year ground revenue per piece increased 27 and next day air revenue per piece increased 33 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005 deferred revenue per piece increased 05 for the year for the same reasons but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight lower revenue packages 

on january 2 2006 a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates 55 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 39 on ups ground other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our delivery required and signature confirmation services the residential surcharge increased 025 for ups ground services and 035 for ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select 

in january 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 1250 through june 4 2006 effective june 5 2006 we reduced the index by another 2 and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge this fuel surcharge continued to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1402 in 2006 as compared with 1023 in 2005 additionally the ups ground fuel surcharge continued to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 413 in 2006 as compared to 286 in 2005 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 542 million in 2006 due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices volume growth and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above these fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices 

us domestic package operating profit increased 430 million or 96 for the year and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 162 this increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks the 2006 operating profit for our us domestic package segment was negatively impacted by the settlement of a class action litigation see “contingencies” section below which resulted in an 87 million charge to expense operating profit for this segment was positively affected as a result of lower expense associated with our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities in 2006 compared with 2005 

international package operations 

2007 compared to 2006 

international package revenue improved 1192 billion or 131 in 2007 driven by a 104 volume increase for our export products and an 83 increase in total revenue per piece the growth in revenue per piece 

  

was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the us dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007 but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our us origin international air products 

export volume increased throughout the world asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year especially china asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion as well as strong economic growth which benefits our intraasian package business to continue this expansion we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the us and nagoya japan we are also constructing a package and freight air hub in shanghai china that is expected to open in 2008 this hub will link shanghai to our international air network with direct service to europe asia and the americas 

european export volume also grew solidly largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the european union us export volume increased at a slower pace nonus domestic volume increased 22 for the year and was impacted by growth in several major european countries and canada 

export revenue per piece increased 39 for the year largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates nonus domestic revenue per piece increased 96 for the year and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates total average revenue per piece increased 27 on a currencyadjusted basis and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by 464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity 

in january 2007 we increased rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year 

also in january 2007 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 12 million during the year due to increased volume but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index 

international package operating profit increased 121 million or 71 for the year primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 153 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates net of hedging activity international package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment 62 million and the svso 7 million both of which are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense the adverse impact of the aircraft impairment svso charge and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 178 

2006 compared to 2005 

international package revenue improved 1112 billion or 139 for the year primarily due to the 119 volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005 total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix as loweryielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume the change in revenue was positively affected by 83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity revenue increased by 247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously 

  

in january 2006 we increased rates 55 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year 

also in january 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 125 through june 4 2006 effective june 5 2006 we reduced the index by another 2 and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment took place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 

export volume increased throughout the world with solid volume increases in europe asia and us export products asian export volume continued to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in asia while european export volume gains were impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the european union international domestic volume increased 210 for the year due to volume growth in canada and europe which also benefited from the acquisition of stolica in poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of lynx in the uk during the third quarter of 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions international domestic volume and revenue increased 69 and 83 respectively for the year 

export revenue per piece increased 05 for the year largely due to the rate increases discussed previously the impact of the fuel surcharge and currency fluctuations partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products for the year total international average daily package volume increased 173 while average revenue per piece decreased 22 decreased 33 currencyadjusted 

the improvement in operating profit for our international package segment was 216 million for the year or 145 and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 188 the increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations 

supply chain  freight operations 

2007 compared to 2006 

supply chain  freight revenue increased 424 million or 53 in 2007 forwarding and logistics revenue increased 230 million or 40 for the year and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006 favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by 178 million during the year revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates 

ups freight increased revenue 156 million or 80 for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume average ltl shipments per day increased 83 during the year driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 93 during the year due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higheryielding customer segments the increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 75 decrease for the year in the ltl weight per shipment 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business our financial business and our us domestic cargo operations increased revenue by 103 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 

  

operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment was 278 million in 2007 compared with a profit of 2 million in 2006 resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin this improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls a focus on asset utilization and revenue management initiatives cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006 which included a reduction of nonoperating staff of approximately 1400 people additionally margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft finally revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets 

operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by 46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain noncore business units in france as well as by 8 million due to the svso charge these charges are discussed further in the “operating expenses” section currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by 18 million in 2007 

2006 compared to 2005 

supply chain  freight revenue increased 2008 billion or 335 for the year ups freight formerly known as overnite corp provided 1155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year excluding the impact of the overnite acquisition in august 2005 segment revenues grew 164 for the year total average daily ltl shipments for ups freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 both the pre and postacquisition period due to service issues caused by the integration of the ups freight business as well as a weakening in the overall ltl market in the united states in the latter half of 2006 ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments 

forwarding and logistics revenue increased 822 million or 169 for the year largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit the forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on ups including increased utilization of upsowned assets this has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense the increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives which involved reducing less profitable accounts in addition revenue increased by 29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations 

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business and our financial business increased revenue by 92 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue as well as revenue earned from our previouslyannounced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the us postal service 

for the year the supply chain  freight segment reported 2 million in operating profit as compared with a 156 million in operating profit for 2005 these results were impacted by the integration of the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding business into our air network and the integration of the motor cargo business unit within the acquired overnite corp operations into the ups freight network the ups freight integration led to service issues which resulted in a loss of revenue as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs the integration of the menlo worldwide forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover the increase in operating profit was positively affected by 2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense 

in an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 this restructuring plan was designed to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers this restructuring involved the reduction of nonoperating expenses by approximately 20 including a reduction in nonoperating staff of approximately 1400 people we incurred 12 million in expenses in 2006 related to employee severance 

  

operating expenses 

2007 compared to 2006 

consolidated operating expenses increased by 8202 billion or 200 in 2007 compared with 2006 currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by 471 million for the year 

compensation and benefits expense increased by 7324 billion for the year and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the central states pension fund higher wage rates in the union workforce increased stockbased compensation higher expense for union pension and welfare programs the svso charge and the restructuring charge in our supply chain  freight business in france these increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense 

our national master agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” allowed us upon ratification to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed singleemployer plan for this group upon ratification of the contract in december 2007 and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund we recorded a pretax 6100 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability and made a december 2007 payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 

in december 2006 we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity “svso” to approximately 640 employees who work in nonoperating functions this program was established to improve the efficiency of nonoperating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company the svso ended in february 2007 and 195 or 30 of eligible employees accepted the offer as a result we recorded a charge to expense of approximately 68 million in the first quarter of 2007 to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 

in the third quarter of 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program which was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in france in july 2007 employees participating in this program are entitled to severance benefits including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase these severance benefits are formuladriven and are in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements we recorded a restructuring charge of 46 million 42 million related to severance costs and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense in 2007 related to this program 

stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense increased 113 million or 177 during 2007 primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options restricted performance units and restricted stock units pension and healthcare expense increased during the year largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees but was somewhat offset by lower expense for the upssponsored pension benefits see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

during the first quarter of 2005 we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units with certain exceptions for first time participants in the program the restricted stock units granted each year under this program generally have a fiveyear graded vesting period with approximately 20 of the total restricted stock unit award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant the other half of the management incentive award granted each year is in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and is fully vested at the time of grant previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we recognize the expense associated with restricted stock unit awards over the appropriate vesting 

  

period we anticipate that this change in the award structure will have the effect of increasing the expense recognized for our restricted stock unit grants in future years until approximately 2010 when we the effect of expensing new restricted stock unit grants will be somewhat offset with the elimination of expense from awards that have become completely vested 

the expense associated with our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities was 46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006 insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies improved oversight and management of claims improved trends in health care costs and favorable state legislative reforms 

the 02 increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings the 02 decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles the 74 increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our international package business and currency fluctuations as well as growth in our international forwarding business the 120 increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel as well as higher usage but was partially mitigated by hedging gains other occupancy expense increased 21 for the year and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes but partially offset by lower utilities expense the 30 increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a 221 million aircraft impairment charge discussed further below but partially offset with cost controls in several areas the comparison in other expenses was also affected by the 87 million charge in the cornn class action litigation in 2006 see “contingencies” section 

as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007 including capacityoptimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses the review was completed in march 2007 and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing 727 and 747 aircraft and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of 221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007 this charge is included in the caption “other expenses” in the statement of consolidated income of which 159 million impacted our us domestic package segment and 62 million impacted our international package segment 

2006 compared to 2005 

consolidated operating expenses increased by 4474 billion or 123 for the year and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of overnite stolica and lynx currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by 84 million for the year 

compensation and benefits increased by 1904 billion or 85 for the year largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense these increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense as previously discussed excluding the effect of acquisitions compensation and benefits expense increased 51 for the year stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense increased 49 million or 80 in 2006 due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005 the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006 and the impact of adopting the nonsubstantive vesting period approach of fas 123r discussed further in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements these grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our management incentive awards program in 2006 

  

other operating expenses increased by 2570 billion or 185 for the year largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation the table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006 

 

 excluding the effect of acquisitions the 202 increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage but was partially mitigated by hedging gains the 301 increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our international package business currency fluctuations higher fuel prices increased rail costs and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously the 23 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs the 32 increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment aircraft and engines and higher amortization expense on intangible assets the 34 increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses the increase in other expenses was impacted by several items including the 87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation see “contingencies” section below 

investment income and interest expense 

2007 compared to 2006 

the increase in investment income of 13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments but partially offset by a lower average balance of interestearning investments and increased equitymethod losses on investment partnerships 

interest expense increased 35 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding largely related to commercial paper our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 causing a corresponding increase in interest expense as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund increased interest charges were somewhat offset however by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects including aircraft purchases and our worldport expansion 

2006 compared to 2005 

the decrease in investment income of 18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings business acquisitions and capital expenditures this was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005 as described below 

the 39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships this was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006 as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year 

  

net income and earnings per share 

2007 compared to 2006 

net income for 2007 was 382 million an 909 decrease from the 4202 billion achieved in 2006 resulting in an 907 decrease in diluted earnings per share to 036 in 2007 from 386 in 2006 this decrease in net income was largely due to the aftertax 3772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund additionally 2007 net income was adversely impacted by 31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our france supply chain  freight business 141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge and 43 million as a result of the svso charge these items were partially offset by the improved results in our international package and supply chain  freight segments 

the reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal aircraft impairment france restructuring and svso charges noted above these items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by 377 and 375 in 2007 basic and diluted earnings per share benefited from a reduction in outstanding shares in 2007 compared with 2006 due to our ongoing share repurchase program 

2006 compared to 2005 

net income for 2006 was 4202 billion an 86 increase from the 3870 billion achieved in 2005 resulting in a 112 increase in diluted earnings per share to 386 in 2006 from 347 in 2005 net income in 2006 benefited from a 52 million reduction in income tax expense 005 impact to diluted earnings per share due to favorable developments with certain us federal tax contingency matters involving nonus operations diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program the increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our us domestic and international package segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1123 5589 and 5793 billion in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2007 operating cash flows compared with 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to the 6100 billion payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund in 2007 this was partially offset by reduced 2007 fundings to our management pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2007 we funded 687 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to 1625 billion in 2006 and 995 million in 2005 as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2008 are projected to be approximately 133 million 

the amount of us federal estimated income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 due to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment for income tax purposes additionally in the first quarter of 2008 we received an 850 million us federal tax refund due to 2007 overpayments of our estimated tax liability in 2005 we received a 374 million tax refund associated with the 19851990 settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” reached previously primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance 

additionally we paid approximately 35 million in 2007 to employees who accepted the svso offer and we expect to pay approximately 28 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to this program 

on november 9 2007 we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on december 31 2007 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground we also increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and 

  

an increase of 010 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes these rate changes are customary and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases additionally we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and usorigin international air services by reducing by 2 the index used to determine the fuel surcharge the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 

in january 2008 ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging 54 percent covering noncontractual shipments in the united states and canada the increase goes into effect on february 4 2008 and applies to minimum charge ltl and tl rates 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2199 billion 2340 billion and 975 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in cash used in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and increased net sales of marketable securities and shortterm investments net sales of marketable securities and shortterm investments were 621 million 482 million and 2752 billion in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans as well as complete business acquisitions in 2005 we spent 1488 billion on business acquisitions primarily overnite corp lynx express ltd in the united kingdom messenger service stolica sa in poland and the express operations of sinotrans air transportation development co ltd in china see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we had a net cash use of 39 million in 2007 compared with cash generation of 68 and 95 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively due to originations sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables primarily in our commercial lending assetbased lending and leasing portfolios 

in the second quarter of 2006 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 229 million in cash which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting we recognized the gains associated with these hedges as a reduction of fuel expense over the original term of the hedges through 2007 

capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities as follows in millions 

 

 as described in the “commitments” section below we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 

financing activities 

net cash provided by used in financing activities was 2297 3851 and 4175 billion in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively as of december 31 2007 we increased our commercial paper borrowings to 7366 billion an increase of 6575 billion over december 31 2006 this issuance of commercial paper was used to fund the withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters as previously discussed the commercial paper balance was reduced subsequent to december 31 2007 as a result of an issuance of longterm debt discussed further in the “sources of credit” section and the receipt of an income tax refund 

  

issuances of debt during 2007 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper and ups notes repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equitymethod partnerships we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock pay dividends and repay longterm debt in october 2007 the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 20 billion which replaced the remaining amount available under our february 2007 share repurchase authorization for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we repurchased a total of 359 326 and 339 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 2618  2455 and 2479 billion respectively 2639 2460 and 2479 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements 

in january 2008 we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value prospectively we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 5060 funds from operations to total debt to implement this policy the board of directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 100 billion we intend to complete this level of share repurchases within two years share repurchases may take the form of an accelerated share repurchase program open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate 

we increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to 042 per share in 2007 from 038 per share in 2006 resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 1703 billion from 1577 billion the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends on january 31 2008 our board declared a dividend of 045 per share which is payable on march 4 2008 to shareowners of record on february 11 2008 the board also approved an earlier payment schedule for the dividend typically declared in november beginning in 2008 and going forward that dividend is expected to be paid in december instead of the following january the movement of the fourth quarter dividend payment into december will result in a total of five dividend payments being made in 2008 

sources of credit 

we are authorized to borrow up to 100 billion under our us commercial paper program we had 7366 billion outstanding under this program as of december 31 2007 with an average interest rate of 436 at december 31 2007 we classified 40 billion of our commercial paper as longterm debt on our balance sheet due to the subsequent refunding of the commercial paper through the issuance of longterm debt as discussed further below we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december 31 2007 

in november 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states on january 15 2008 we completed an offering of 1750 billion of 450 senior notes due january 2013 750 million of 550 senior notes due january 2018 and 1500 billion of 620 senior notes due january 2038 all of these notes pay interest semiannually and allow for redemption of the notes by ups at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “makewhole” amount plus accrued interest after pricing and underwriting discounts we received a total of 3961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering the proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance 

we maintain three credit agreements with a consortium of banks two of which provide revolving credit facilities of 10 billion each with one expiring april 17 2008 and the other april 19 2012 and the third 

  

providing a revolving credit facility of 70 billion and expiring on october 17 2008 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points at december 31 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants covenants in our credit facilities generally require us to maintain a 30 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company the notes issued in january 2008 include limitations on secured indebtedness and on saleleaseback transactions these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company and all applicable covenant tests were satisfied as of december 31 2007 

commitments 

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2007 in millions 

 

 our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft capital leases operating leases and purchase commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2007 the calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements the maturities of debt principal and interest include the effect of the january 2008 issuance of 40 billion in senior notes that were used to reduce the commercial paper balance 

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts in february 2007 we announced an order for 27 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 we also have firm commitments to purchase nine boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery between 2008 and 2010 and two boeing 747400bcf aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

in july 2007 we formally cancelled our previous order for ten airbus a380800 freighter aircraft pursuant to the provisions of an agreement signed with airbus in february 2007 as a result of our cancellation of the airbus a380800 order we received cash in july 2007 representing the return of amounts previously paid to airbus as purchase contract deposits and accrued interest on those balances additionally we received a credit memorandum to be used by ups for the purchase of parts and services from airbus the cancellation of the airbus order did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters the ups ibt pension plan is the only upssponsored pension or postretirement benefit plan with a material minimum funding requirement as of december 31 2007 the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 using discount rates asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for this plan to the extent that the funded status of the ups ibt pension plan in future years differs from our current projections the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 

the contractual payments due under the “other liabilities” column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the table above does not include approximately 355 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash in addition although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin 48 we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities fin 48 is discussed further in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 2177 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements as of december 31 2007 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 860 million associated with our financial business 

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

contingencies 

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1200 fulltime supervisors in august 2005 the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims and plaintiff appealed the ruling in october 2007 the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in another case cornn v ups which was certified as a class action in a california federal court plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages andor overtime and meal and rest periods plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23600 drivers and seek back wages penalties interest and attorneys’ fees ups settled this matter in full for a total payment of 87 million in the second quarter of 2007 the settlement had no impact on our 2007 operating results as it was accrued for previously during the third quarter of 2006 

in another case hohider v ups which in july 2007 was certified as a class action in a pennsylvania federal court plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the americans with disabilities act plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35000 current and former employees and seek backpay compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys’ fees in august 2007 the third circuit court of appeals granted the company’s petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s recent certification order the appeal will likely take one year at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

ups and mail boxes etc inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc centers and the ups store locations these lawsuits relate to the rebranding of mail boxes etc centers to the ups store the the ups store business model the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises and ups’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

ups and ups freight along with several other companies involved in the ltl freight business have been named as defendants in numerous putative classaction lawsuits filed since july 30 2007 in courts across the nation the cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia the lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates and they seek injunctive relief treble damages and attorneys’ fees we intend to defend against these suits vigorously these cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

along with an income tax audit for years 2003 and 2004 the internal revenue service “irs” is currently examining nonincome based taxes including excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases which could lead to proposed assessments the irs has not presented an official position with regard to excise taxes at this time and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment however we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 246000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters in september 2007 we reached a new national master agreement with the teamsters which was ratified in december 2007 the new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement will take effect on august 1 2008 with the exception of our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we have approximately 2900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which becomes amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable on november 1 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 on october 2 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers approximately 2900 these agreements run through july 31 2009 

apart from the central states pension fund we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

other matters 

we received grand jury subpoenas from the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” regarding the doj’s investigations into air cargo pricing practices in july 2006 and into freight forwarding 

  

pricing practices in december 2007 in october 2007 we received information requests from the european commission and the new zealand commerce commission relating to investigations of freight forwarding pricing practices we are cooperating with these investigations 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled  

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline currently the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes additionally we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2007 and 2006 was an asset liability of 179 and 10 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 42 and 8 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

in the second quarter of 2006 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 229 million in cash these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through the end of 2007 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of 42 and 30 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for 

  

such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 387 and 183 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 

our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december 31 2007 and 2007 would be approximately 100 and 29 million respectively 

we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2007 and 2006 would be approximately 15 and 12 million respectively 

additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2007 and 2006 would be immaterial 

this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

equity price risk 

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2007 and 2006 the fair value of such investments was 35 and 80 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 4 and 8 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 

credit risk 

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas 157” which was issued to define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures about fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb deferred the effective date of fas 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope we adopted fas 157 on january 1 2008 and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “fas 158” this statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet and required delayed recognition items consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement on december 31 2006 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fas 158 which resulted in a reduction to aoci of 2097 billion and a reduction of longterm deferred tax liabilities of 1258 billion 

additionally we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under statement no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and we measure the funded status of our plans as of september 30 each year under the provisions of fas 158 we will be required to use a december 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008 as a result of this change in measurement date we recorded a cumulative effect aftertax 44 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “fas 159” which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie the fair value option on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings additionally sfas no 159 allows for a onetime election for existing positions upon adoption with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings we adopted fas 159 on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method accordingly we recorded an aftertax 12 million reduction to retained earnings as of january 1 2008 representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting fas 159 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements on january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fin 48 and the impact of this interpretation is discussed in note 13 

in june 2007 the eitf reached consensus on issue no 0611 “accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on sharebased payment awards” eitf 0611 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units which are expected to vest be recorded as an increase to additional paidin capital eitf 0611 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 and we will adopt the provisions of eitf 0611 beginning in the first quarter of 2008 eitf 0611 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141r “business combinations” “fas 141r” fas 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired 

  

and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination fas 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 the impact of fas no 141r on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” “fas 160” fas 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling minority interests as equity as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 13 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other noncurrent liabilities fas 160 applies prospectively as of january 1 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

contingencies —as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas 5 evaluation we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas 5 these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas 5 excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2007 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2007 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

goodwill impairment —we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 

  

we use a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to estimate the fair value of our goodwill the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

as of december 31 2007 our recorded goodwill was 2577 billion of which 2282 billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years largely due to the acquisitions that we have made because of its growth this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments our annual impairment tests performed in 2007 2006 and 2005 resulted in no goodwill impairment 

selfinsurance accruals —we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

pension and postretirement medical benefits —as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends differences in actual 

  

experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company’s costs and obligations for the year 2007 in millions 

 

 financial instruments —as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets —as of december 31 2007 we had 17663 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “fas 144” we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that 

  

would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007 including capacityoptimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses the review was completed in march 2007 and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing 727 and 747 aircraft and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of 221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007 this charge is included in the caption “other expenses” in the statement of consolidated income of which 159 million impacted our us domestic package segment and 62 million impacted our international package segment 

during 2006 we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing 757 boeing 767 and airbus a300 fleets and as a result of this evaluation increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30 to 10 of original cost this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 

income taxes —we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the first quarter of 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of sfas no 109” “fin 48” and related guidance see note 13 in the consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

  

forwardlooking statements 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and other parts of this report contain “forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “we see” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements 

risk factors 

the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forwardlooking statements

index to financial statements from the beginnings in germany 30 years ago our european network has grown significantly and now fully supports air and ground shipments throughout the continent we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

  

through more than two dozen alliances with asian delivery companies that supplement companyowned operations we currently serve more than 40 asia pacific countries and territories two of the fastest growing economies in the world china and india are among our most promising opportunities 

  

our canadian operations include both intracanada and importexport capabilities we deliver to all addresses throughout canada we are also the largest air cargo carrier and a leading logistics provider in latin america and the caribbean 

  

technology we are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers optimize their business processes to lower costs improve service and increase efficiency we have a strong global capability as a mover of electronic information we currently collect electronic data on 97 of the packages that move through our us system each day – more than any of our competitors 

  

in 2003 we announced plans to reengineer our package pickup and delivery processes which we believe will result in gains in efficiency reliability and flexibility once the new technology is deployed in our package sorting facilities we anticipate achieving savings through productivity improvements as well as in reduced fuel usage by the end of 2006 we had deployed this technology for use by almost 74 of our drivers 

  

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to conveniently send manage and track their shipments but to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own web sites 

  

broad flexible range of services and integrated solutions our portfolio of services enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements substantially all of our us small package delivery services are guaranteed 

  

our express air services are integrated with our vast ground delivery system – one system handling all products this integrated air and ground network enhances efficiency improves productivity and asset utilization and provides us with the flexibility to transport packages using the most reliable and costeffective transportation mode or combination of modes our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns – by far the best in our industry 

  

increasingly our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many ups services in addition to package delivery we offer over 60 supply chain services – such as freight forwarding customs brokerage order fulfillment and returns management – that help improve efficiency of the supply chain management process

index to financial statements we place significant value on the quality of our customer relationships and we conduct comprehensive research to monitor customer perceptions since 1993 we have conducted telephone interviews with shipping decisionmakers virtually every business day to determine their satisfaction with small package carriers and perception of performance on 19 service factors results from this survey for 2006 continue to show high levels of customer satisfaction 

  

brand equity we have built a leading and trusted brand in our industry – a brand that stands for quality service reliability and product innovation the distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity 

  

distinctive culture we believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive “employeeowner” concept our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927 when our founders who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business first offered stock to employees to facilitate employee stock ownership we maintain several stockbased compensation programs 

  

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy makes it generally unnecessary for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the vast majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and has spent their entire careers with us our chief executive officer and many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners 

  

financial strength our balance sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match as of december 31 2006 we had a balance of cash cash equivalents marketable securities and shortterm investments of approximately 1983 billion and shareowners’ equity of 15482 billion longterm debt was 3133 billion we carry longterm debt ratings of aaaaaa from standard  poor’s and moody’s respectively reflecting our low use of debt and strong capacity to service our obligations our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale and to make investments in technology transportation equipment and buildings as well as to pursue strategic opportunities which will facilitate our growth 

  

growth strategy 

  

our growth strategy takes advantage of our competitive strengths while maintaining our focus on meeting or exceeding our customers’ requirements the principal components of our growth strategy are 

  

build on our leadership position in our us business we believe that our tradition of reliable package delivery service our experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling our existing and new services to our large and diverse customer base to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

  

continued international expansion we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades the international package delivery market continues to grow at a faster rate than that of the us we will use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services and to implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for growth 

  

europe is our largest region outside the united states – accounting for approximately half of our international revenue 

  

index to financial statements in early 2006 to accommodate growth opportunities across the whole of europe we completed the expansion of our automated package sorting hub at the cologne  bonn airport in germany the expansion doubled the hub’s original sorting capacity to 110000 packages per hour largely through the deployment of new automation technology 

  

growth in asia will be driven by global demand leading to improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region with specific emphasis on china and india we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology in asia in 2002 we opened a new intraasia hub at clark air force base in pampanga philippines to enable future growth in the region this hub allows us to compete more effectively in the asian express market and improve our service between europe and asia 

  

in 2003 we received from the us department of transportation the authority to expand service to and through hong kong including permanent authority to fly from hong kong to other cities specifically to our cologne hub in europe we continue our development efforts in the fastgrowing china market

our americas international gateway in miami florida is the focal point for trade between latin america and the us this gateway complements our operations in florida and latin america and represents our commitment to the americas market we believe that there is longterm potential for us to expand our service offerings in latin america and in 2006 ups de mexico enhanced territory coverage by expanding to nine additional cities across mexico ups de mexico is now able to offer improved service and broader coverage to our customers in mexico

index to financial statements us domestic package operations 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1846 billion or 65 for the year with average daily package volume up 44 volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid us economy strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005 due to slower overall economic growth in the us and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter 

  

pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 25 for the year ground revenue per piece increased 27 and next day air revenue per piece increased 33 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005 deferred revenue per piece increased 05 for the year for the same reasons but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight lower revenue packages 

  

on january 2 2006 a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates 55 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 39 on ups ground other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our delivery required and signature confirmation services the residential surcharge increased 025 for ups ground services and 035 for ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select 

  

in january 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 1250 through june 4 2006 effective june 5 2006 we reduced the index by another 2 and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge this fuel surcharge continues to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1402 in 2006 as compared with 1023 in 2005 additionally the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 413 in 2006 as compared to 286 in 2005 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 542 million in 2006 due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices volume growth and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above these fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices 

  

us domestic package operating profit increased 430 million or 96 for the year and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 162 this increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks the 2006 operating profit for our us domestic package segment was negatively impacted by a tentative settlement of a class action litigation see “contingencies” section below which resulted in an 87 million charge to expense 

  

the expense associated with our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities was 83 million less in 2006 compared with 2005 insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on ultimate reserve levels determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies improved oversight and management of claims improved trends in health care costs and favorable state legislative reforms primarily in california 

  

index to financial statements 2005 compared to 2004 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1650 billion or 61 for the year primarily due to a 34 increase in average daily package volume and a 25 increase in revenue per piece ground volume grew 34 and was positively impacted by a solid us economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives next day air volume grew 28 and deferred volume increased 40 with growth in the manufacturing business services telecommunications and retail sectors the growth in total us domestic package volume strengthened throughout the year 

  

ground revenue per piece increased 37 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005 as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products next day air revenue per piece increased 20 for the year primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004 next day air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our saver product both next day air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights 

  

on january 3 2005 a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates 29 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air ups 3 day select and ups ground other pricing changes included an increase of 025 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes the residential surcharge increased 010 for ups ground services and 035 for ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select 

  

in january 2005 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 950 which was increased to 1250 effective in october 2005 this fuel surcharge continued to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1023 in 2005 as compared with 707 in 2004 additionally an initial fuel surcharge of 200 was applied to ups ground services in january 2005 which fluctuated based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 286 in 2005 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 683 million for the year due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices volume increases and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above 

  

us domestic package operating profit increased 791 million or 214 for the year and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points operating profit increased by 274 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” which also favorably impacted the operating margin the remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously as well as controlled growth of operating expenses 

  

international package operations 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

international package revenue improved 1112 billion or 139 for the year primarily due to the 119 volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005 total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix as loweryielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume the change in revenue was positively affected by 83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity revenue increased by 247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously 

  

in january 2006 we increased rates 55 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year 

  

index to financial statements also in january 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on certain usrelated international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2 the air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 125 through june 4 2006 effective june 5 2006 we reduced the index by another 2 and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 

  

export volume increased throughout the world with solid volume increases in europe asia and us export products asian export volume continues to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in asia while european export volume gains are impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the european union international domestic volume increased 210 for the year due to volume growth in canada and europe which also benefited from the acquisition of stolica in poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of lynx in the uk during the third quarter of 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions international domestic volume and revenue increased 69 and 83 respectively for the year 

  

export revenue per piece increased 05 for the year largely due to the rate increases discussed previously the impact of the fuel surcharge and currency fluctuations partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products for the year total international average daily package volume increased 173 while average revenue per piece decreased 22 decreased 33 currencyadjusted 

  

the improvement in operating profit for our international package segment was 216 million for the year or 145 and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 188 the increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously the change in operating profit was also positively affected by 26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

international package revenue improved 1168 billion or 172 for the year primarily due to the 139 volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements the improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes currency fluctuations and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments revenue increased 121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity and also increased by 133 million during the year due to business acquisitions 

  

in january 2005 we increased rates 29 for international shipments originating in the united states which includes our worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard services rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states varied by geographical market and occured throughout the year 

  

in january 2005 we modified the fuel surcharge on us export products by setting a maximum cap of 950 which was increased to 1250 effective in october 2005 the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 246 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 

  

export volume increased throughout the world with strong growth in asia and europe asian export volume which increased 29 for the year was driven by export growth from china asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network including the additional flights from shanghai china that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004 and express air service between the us and guangzhou china that began in the second quarter of 2005 european export volume increased 13 for the year while export volume from the us and americas also showed solid increases international domestic volume 

  

index to financial statements increased 124 for the year due to volume growth in canada and europe which also benefited from the acquisition of messenger service stolica sa in poland during the second quarter of 2005 and lynx express ltd in the united kingdom in the third quarter of 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions international domestic volume increased 37 

  

export revenue per piece increased 31 for the year 14 currencyadjusted due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product in total international average daily package volume increased 130 and average revenue per piece increased 40 24 currencyadjusted 

  

the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 345 million for the year or 300 with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points this increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion the increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by 78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense net of hedging activity and by 45 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by 23 million in currency repatriation losses as compared with repatriation gains of 32 million in 2004 

  

supply chain  freight operations 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

supply chain  freight revenue increased 2008 billion or 335 for the year ups freight formerly known as overnite corp provided 1155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year excluding the impact of the overnite acquisition in august 2005 segment revenues grew 164 for the year total average daily ltl shipments for ups freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 both the pre and postacquisition period due to service issues caused by the integration of the ups freight business as well as a weakening in the overall ltl market in the united states in the latter half of 2006 ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments 

  

forwarding and logistics revenue increased 822 million or 169 for the year largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit the forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on ups including increased utilization of upsowned assets this has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense the increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives which involved reducing less profitable accounts in addition revenue increased by 29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations 

  

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business and our financial business increased revenue by 92 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue as well as revenue earned from our previouslyannounced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the us postal service 

  

for the year the supply chain  freight segment reported 2 million in operating profit as compared with a 156 million in operating profit for 2005 these results were impacted by the integration of the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding business into our air network and the integration of the motor cargo business unit within the acquired overnite corp operations into the ups freight network the ups freight integration led to service issues which resulted in a loss of revenue as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs the integration of the menlo worldwide forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover the increase in operating profit was positively affected by 2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense 

  

index to financial statements in an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 this restructuring plan is expected to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers this restructuring involves plans to reduce nonoperating expenses by approximately 20 including a reduction in nonoperating staff of approximately 1400 people as of december 31 2006 12 million in costs have been accrued related to employee severance 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

supply chain  freight revenue increased 3181 billion or 1131 for the year forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by 2383 billion during the year largely due to the acquisition of menlo worldwide forwarding in december 2004 the growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses excluding menlo worldwide forwarding was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations revenue increased by 17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution 

  

during the third quarter of 2005 we completed our acquisition of overnite corp now known as ups freight which offers a variety of ltl and truckload services to customers in north america overnite’s results have been included in the supply chain  freight reporting segment since the august 5 2005 acquisition date overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the postacquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of ups including improvements in average daily ltl shipments and average ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 

  

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business our mail and consulting services and our financial business increased revenue by 03 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units 

  

operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment increased by 18 million or 130 for the year largely due to the operating profits generated by overnite operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding operations as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by 4 million during the year operating profit also was favorably impacted by 15 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” 

  

operating expenses 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 4474 billion or 123 for the year and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of overnite stolica and lynx currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by 84 million for the year 

  

compensation and benefits increased by 1904 billion or 85 for the year largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense these increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense as previously discussed excluding the effect of acquisitions compensation and benefits expense increased 51 for the year stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense increased 49 million or 80 in 2006 due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005 the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006 and the impact of adopting the nonsubstantive vesting period approach of fas 123r discussed further in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements these grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our management incentive awards program in 2006 

  

index to financial statements other operating expenses increased by 2570 billion or 185 for the year largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation the table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006 

  

   

excluding the effect of acquisitions the 202 increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage but was partially mitigated by hedging gains the 301 increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our international package business currency fluctuations higher fuel prices increased rail costs and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously the 23 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs the 32 increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment aircraft and engines and higher amortization expense on intangible assets the 34 increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses the increase in other expenses was impacted by several items including the 87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation see “contingencies” section below 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 4845 billion or 153 for the year and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite operating expenses also increased 56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations net of hedging activity in our international package and supply chain  freight segments and increased 55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our international package segment 

  

compensation and benefits increased by 1694 billion or 81 for the year largely due to the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense decreased 297 million or 334 in the year due to a change in our management incentive awards program implemented in 2005 described in the next paragraph which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 beginning with 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  

during the first quarter of 2005 we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units “rsus” the rsus granted in november 2005 under this program have a fiveyear graded vesting period with approximately 20 of the total rsu award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant the other half of the award granted in november 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant this change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense as a result 2005 expense for our management incentive awards program reported in operating expenses under “compensation and benefits” including the rsus decreased 334 million 213 million aftertax or 019 per diluted share compared with 2004 

  

index to financial statements other operating expenses increased by 3151 billion or 293 for the year largely due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite acquisitions as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation the 472 increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher fuel usage but was partially mitigated with hedging gains the 955 increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition but was also influenced by volume growth in our international package business and higher fuel prices the 92 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts partially affected by the overnite acquisition airframe and aircraft engine maintenance the 65 increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings largely due to acquisitions aircraft and capitalized software the 160 increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our supply chain  freight segment which was impacted by the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition and increased utilities expense the 45 increase in other expenses was primarily due to the overnite acquisition but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the 110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004 

  

investment income and interest expense 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

the decrease in investment income of 18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interestearning investments due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings business acquisitions and capital expenditures this was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005 as described below 

  

the 39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships this was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006 as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

the increase in investment income of 22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing shortterm interest rates in the united states but partially offset by a lower average balance of interestearning investments increased equitymethod losses on certain investment partnerships and an investment impairment charge on certain availableforsale securities we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost overall economic and market conditions and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer after considering these factors we recorded an impairment charge of 16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 

  

the 23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with real estate investment partnerships 

  

net income and earnings per share 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

net income for 2006 was 4202 billion an 86 increase from the 3870 billion achieved in 2005 resulting in a 112 increase in diluted earnings per share to 386 in 2006 from 347 in 2005 net income in 2006 benefited from a 52 million reduction in income tax expense 005 impact to diluted earnings per share 

  

index to financial statements due to favorable developments with certain us federal tax contingency matters involving nonus operations diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program the increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our us domestic and international package segments 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

net income for 2005 was 3870 billion a 161 increase from the 3333 billion achieved in 2004 resulting in an 184 increase in diluted earnings per share to 347 in 2005 from 293 in 2004 the increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our us domestic and international package segments net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 363 in 2005 from 323 in 2004 the lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling 142 million 013 per diluted share related to various items including the resolution of certain tax matters the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items 

  

net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a 70 million aftertax impairment charge 006 per diluted share on boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft engines and parts as well as a 40 million aftertax charge 004 per diluted share to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash from operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 5589 5793 and 5331 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in 2006 operating cash flows compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher pension and retirement plan fundings but partially offset by increased net income in 2006 we funded 1625 billion to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to 995 million in 2005 as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2007 are projected to be approximately 581 million in 2005 we received a 374 million tax refund associated with the 19851990 settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” reached previously primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance in 2004 we received 610 million from a tax settlement with the irs for tax years 198384 and 199198 additionally we expect to pay a total of 69 million between 2007 and 2008 related to employees who accepted a recentlyannounced special voluntary separation opportunity which is discussed further in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

on november 17 2006 we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on january 1 2007 we increased the base rates 69 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 49 on ups ground we also increased the base rates 69 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service we increased our ground hundredweight rates by an average of 59 other pricing changes included a 010 increase in the residential surcharge and a 075 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts these rate changes are customary and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases additionally in january 2007 we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and usorigin international air services by reducing by 2 the index used to determine the fuel surcharge the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

  

net cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2340 billion 975 million and 3638 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increased cash used in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and fewer net sales of marketable securities and shortterm investments during 2006 we 

  

index to financial statements sold a net 482 million in marketable securities and shortterm investments primarily due to the pension and postretirement medical benefit plan fundings in the third quarter during 2005 we sold a net 2752 billion in marketable securities and shortterm investments largely to fund the acquisition of overnite as well as to make fundings to our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in 2005 we spent 1488 billion on business acquisitions primarily overnite corp lynx express ltd in the united kingdom messenger service stolica sa in poland and the express operations of sinotrans air transportation development co ltd in china see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we generated cash of 68 95 and 318 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables primarily in our leasing assetbased lending and receivable factoring businesses 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 229 million in cash which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007 

  

capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities as follows in millions 

  

   

as described in the “commitments” section below we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 3851 4175 and 2014 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock pay dividends and repay longterm debt in july 2006 the board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion for future share repurchases in addition to the amount remaining under our august 2005 share repurchase authorization we repurchased a total of 326 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 2455 billion in 2006 2460 billion reported on statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements and 339 million shares for 2479 billion in 2005 as of december 31 2006 we had 936 million of our share repurchase authorization remaining in february 2007 the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 20 billion which replaced the remaining amounts available under our july 2006 authorization on february 8 2007 our board declared a dividend of 042 per share which is payable on march 6 2007 to shareowners of record on february 20 2007 

  

we increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to 038 per share in 2006 from 033 per share in 2005 resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 1577 billion from 1391 billion the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 

  

issuances of debt during 2006 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper ups notes and facility notes and bonds repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equitymethod partnerships we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

  

index to financial statements sources of credit 

  

we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to 70 billion in the united states we had 791 million outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2006 with an average interest rate of 520 the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies there were no amounts outstanding under this program as of december 31 2006 

  

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of 10 billion each with one expiring on april 19 2007 and the other on april 21 2010 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december 31 2006 

  

in august 2003 we filed a 20 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states there was 136 million issued under this shelf registration statement at december 31 2006 all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 

  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants these covenants generally require us to maintain a 30 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company and all covenant tests were satisfied as of december 31 2006 

  

commitments 

  

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases operating leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2006 in millions including the boeing 767300er order discussed further below 

  

   

our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft these lease obligations and commitments as well as our debt principal obligations are discussed further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixedrate debt in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31 2006 the calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 

  

purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding the largest of which are orders for aircraft engines and parts we have firm commitments to purchase four boeing md11 aircraft and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2007 in february 2007 we announced an order for 27 boeing 767300er freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 this order is 

  

index to financial statements reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above we also have firm commitments to purchase eight boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008 and two boeing 747400bcf aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

  

in addition we currently have a firm commitment to purchase 10 airbus a380800 freighter aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional a380800 aircraft this order is reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above in february 2007 we announced that we had signed an agreement with airbus to set out a timetable for deciding the status of this previous order the agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the a380800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party later in 2007 the revised delivery schedule specifies the delivery dates for the 10 airbus a380800’s on order as being between 2012 and 2013 whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the airbus a380800 aircraft between 2009 and 2012 the signing of this agreement will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the contractual payments due under the other liabilities column includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships the commitments above exclude our planned pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions as we do not have any material funding requirements for our upssponsored pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2006 in 2007 we plan to contribute 533 million to our us pension and postretirement benefit plans and 48 million to our international pension plans our funding policy for us plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations or to directly fund payments to plan participants as applicable international pension plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations we have also guaranteed our obligations for certain international pension plans up to a maximum amount of 118 million see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 2213 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements as of december 31 2006 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 604 million associated with our financial business 

  

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1200 fulltime supervisors the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

in another case cornn v ups which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages andor overtime and meal and rest periods plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23600 drivers and seek back wages penalties interest and attorneys’ fees ups has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of 87 million on december 6 2006 the court granted tentative approval of the settlement 

  

index to financial statements we are named as a defendant in four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers we are not named as a defendant in at least eightysix related cases that make similar allegations these cases have been consolidated in a multi district litigation proceeding pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york ups was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the multidistrict litigation is proceeding in addition in july 2006 we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the ontario canada superior court of justice we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases 

  

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 246000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2008 in the third quarter of 2006 we began formal negotiations with the teamsters on a new agreement we have approximately 2800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association “ipa” on june 30 2006 ups and the ipa announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract which was ratified in the third quarter this new contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which became amendable on november 1 2006 we began formal negotiations with teamsters local 2727 on october 2 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers these agreements run through july 31 2009 

  

other matters 

  

on july 14 2006 we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” the subpoena relates to the doj’s publiclyannounced criminal investigation of the air cargo pricing practices of a number of domestic and foreign airlines we do not believe that we are a target of this investigation and we intend to cooperate 

  

with the assistance of outside counsel we investigated certain conduct within our supply chain solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the united states our investigation determined that certain conduct which commenced prior to our subsidiary’s 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of fritz companies inc may have violated the united states foreign corrupt practices act the monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial we have implemented numerous remediation steps we informed the sec and the doj of our investigation and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues we do not believe that the results of this investigation the remediation or related penalties if any will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not 

  

index to financial statements engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

  

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled  

  

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline which are used in the transportation of packages additionally we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products primarily natural gas and electricity used in our operating facilities throughout the world we use a combination of options swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2006 and 2005 was an asset of 10 and 192 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 8 and 35 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we terminated several energy derivatives and received 229 million in cash these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset of 30 and 52 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 183 and 65 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

  

index to financial statements interest rate risk 

  

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 

  

our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december 31 2006 and 2005 would be approximately 29 million each year 

  

we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities as well as cashequivalent instruments some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2006 and 2005 would be approximately 12 and 14 million respectively 

  

additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2006 and 2005 would be immaterial 

  

this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

  

equity price risk 

  

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2006 and 2005 the fair value of such investments was 80 and 89 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 8 and 9 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 

  

credit risk 

  

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “fas 158” this statement requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 

  

index to financial statements fas 158 also requires delayed recognition items consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement on december 31 2006 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fas 158 the effect of adopting fas 158 on our balance sheet as of december 31 2006 has been included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods 

  

additionally we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under statement no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and we measure the funded status of our plans as of september 30 each year under the provisions of fas 158 we will be required to use a december 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans no later than 2008 we do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition financial statement classification taxrelated interest and penalties and additional disclosure requirements we are required to adopt this interpretation effective january 1 2007 we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas 157” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 fas 157 was issued to define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures about fair value measurements fas 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

   

   

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

contingencies — as discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

  

index to financial statements the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas 5 evaluation we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas 5 these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas 5 excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2006 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2006 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

  

goodwill impairment — we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 

  

we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the fair value of our goodwill the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

  

as of december 31 2006 our recorded goodwill was 2533 billion of which 2243 billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made because of its growth this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments our annual impairment tests performed in 2006 2005 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment 

  

selfinsurance accruals —we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

  

workers’ compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

  

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees we use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans these liabilities and related expenses are based on 

  

index to financial statements estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

  

pension and postretirement medical benefits —as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company’s costs and obligations for the year 2006 in millions 

  

   

financial instruments —as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

  

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets —as of december 31 2006 we had 16779 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we 

  

index to financial statements make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

  

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

  

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “fas 144” we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

  

during 2006 we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing 757 boeing 767 and airbus a300 fleets and as a result of this evaluation increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30 to 10 of original cost this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 

  

in december 2004 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2004 for these aircraft including the related engines and parts 91 million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and 19 million of which impacted the international package segment this charge was classified in the caption “other expenses” on the income statement ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2006 or 2005 

  

income taxes —we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events including the impact of adjustments if any resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carryforward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based in part on estimates of future taxable income a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of the available evidence it is more likely than not likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate in this regard we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 

  

index to financial statements during the third quarter of 2006 we recognized a 52 million reduction of income tax expense related to favorable developments with certain us federal tax contingency matters involving nonus operations 

  

during 2004 the resolution of tax matters with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of 142 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and other parts of this report contain “forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “we see” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements

through more than two dozen alliances with asian delivery companies that supplement companyowned operations we currently serve more than 40 asia pacific countries and territories two of the fastest growing economies in the world china and india are among our most promising opportunities

our canadian operations include both intracanada and importexport capabilities we deliver to all addresses throughout canada we are also the only carrier to offer guaranteed 800 am next day delivery to most major metropolitan cities in canada 

  

technology we are a global leader in developing technology that improves our customers’ business processes we have a strong global capability as a mover of electronic information we currently collect electronic data on 97 of the packages that move through our us system each day – more than any of our competitors 

  

in 2003 we announced plans to reengineer our package pickup and delivery processes over several years beginning in 2003 we expect to invest approximately 600 million to simplify and optimize these processes which we believe will result in gains in efficiency reliability and flexibility once the new technology is deployed in our package sorting facilities we anticipate achieving savings through productivity improvements as well as in reduced fuel usage by the end of 2005 we had deployed this technology for use by almost 61 of our drivers 

  

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to conveniently send manage and track their shipments but to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own web sites 

  

ecommerce capabilities we are a leading facilitator of global ecommerce we enable our customers around the world to thrive in this environment by providing a portfolio of technology solutions that streamlines their shipment processing and integrates critical transportation information into their business applications

in 2003 we introduced our first new logo in 42 years the change was more than cosmetic it signaled our commitment to provide more comprehensive solutions to meet our customers’ needs and to be the leader in the broader business arena of synchronized commerce 

  

distinctive culture we believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive “employeeowner” concept our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927 when our founders who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business first offered stock to employees to facilitate employee stock ownership we maintain several stockbased compensation programs 

  

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy makes it generally unnecessary for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the vast majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and has spent their entire careers with us our chief executive officer and many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners

build on our leadership position in our us business we believe that our tradition of reliable package delivery service our experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our 

  

index to financial statements competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling our existing and new services to our large and diverse customer base to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

  

continued international expansion we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades the international package delivery market continues to grow at a faster rate than that of the us we will use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services and to implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations 

  

europe is our largest region outside the united states – accounting for half of our international revenue both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for growth the expansion of the european union to include several eastern european and baltic countries will create even greater economic cohesion growth in asia will be driven by global demand leading to improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region with specific emphasis on china and india 

  

provide comprehensive supply chain solutions in today’s global economy entire industries have outsourced all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to strengthen their balance sheets to support new business models and to improve service companies’ global supply chains are growing increasingly complex this is creating further demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade services with financial and information services we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth for the following reasons

mexico and canada are also important to our international business we developed the ups trade direct sm cross border service to manage package movements between the us and these countries this service combines our small package freight and brokerage capabilities to create an integrated streamlined and economical doortodoor solution for customers with complex crossborder distribution needs 

  

the trade direct portfolio of ocean and air services integrates our small package and supply chain solutions capabilities to provide additional value to our international customers in essence the trade direct service consolidates individually labeled packages or pallets into one movement across borders when the goods arrive in the destination country packages are deconsolidated and entered into the ups system for delivery often eliminating the receiving sorting and handling necessary in distribution centers this service significantly cuts the supply chain cycle from point of origin to consignee it also provides our customers with faster time to market reduced costs increased visibility and better management of their global supply chain

competition 

  

we are the largest package delivery company in the world in terms of both revenue and volume we offer a broad array of services in the package delivery industry and therefore compete with many different companies and services on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the united states and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others 

  

index to financial statements we believe one increasingly important element of competition is a carrier’s ability to integrate its distribution and information systems with its customers’ systems to provide transportation solutions at competitive prices we rely on our vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and maintain customers as we expand our supply chain solutions service offerings we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain financial services and information technology industries 

  

government regulation 

  

the us department of homeland security through the transportation security administration “tsa” the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulates air transportation services 

  

the tsa regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the tsa mission statement to “protects the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce” 

  

the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad we are subject to us customs laws and related dot regulations regarding the import and export of shipments to and from the us in addition our customs brokerage entities are subject to those same laws and regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters 

  

the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance personnel and ground facilities in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the operational requirements of federal aviation regulations 

  

faa regulations mandate an aircraft corrosion control program and aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals specified by approved programs and procedures for all aircraft our total expenditures under these programs for 2005 were 14 million the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate all mandated repairs have been completed or are scheduled to be completed within the timeframes specified by the faa 

  

our ground transportation of packages in the us is subject to the dot’s jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of routes and to both the dot’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of safety insurance and hazardous materials

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

we were named as a defendant in twentysix nowdismissed lawsuits that sought to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for reinsured excess value “ev” insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 these actions were all filed after an august 9 1999 us tax court decision that the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit later reversed these twentysix cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york in addition to the cases in which ups was named as a defendant there also was an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc centers that case also was consolidated into the mdl proceeding 

  

in late 2003 the parties reached a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding in reaching the settlement we and the other defendants expressly denied any and all liability on july 30 2004 the court issued an order granting final approval to the substantive terms of the settlement no appeals were filed and the settlement became effective on september 8 2004 

  

pursuant to the settlement ups provided qualifying settlement class members with vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and agreed to pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs other defendants contributed to the costs of the litigation and settlement the vouchers expired in july 2005 and the value of services for which vouchers were redeemed totaled 5 million on november 2 2005 the court issued an order awarding plaintiffs’ counsel fees and costs in the total amount of 3 million the settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

index to financial statements us domestic package operations 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1650 billion or 61 for the year primarily due to a 34 increase in average daily package volume and a 25 increase in revenue per piece ground volume grew 34 and was positively impacted by a solid us economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives next day air volume grew 28 and deferred volume increased 40 with growth in the manufacturing business services telecommunications and retail sectors the growth in total us domestic package volume strengthened throughout the year 

  

ground revenue per piece increased 37 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005 as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products next day air revenue per piece increased 20 for the year primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004 next day air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our saver product both next day air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights 

  

on january 3 2005 a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates 29 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air ups 3 day select and ups ground other pricing changes included an increase of 025 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes the residential surcharge increased 010 for ups ground services and 035 for ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select 

  

in january 2005 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 950 which was increased to 1250 effective in october 2005 this fuel surcharge continues to be based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 1023 in 2005 as compared with 707 in 2004 additionally an initial fuel surcharge of 200 was applied to ups ground services in january 2005 which fluctuates based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price based on published rates the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 290 in 2005 total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by 683 million for the year due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices volume increases and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above these fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices 

  

us domestic package operating profit increased 791 million or 214 for the year and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points operating profit increased by 274 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” which also favorably impacted the operating margin the remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously as well as controlled growth of operating expenses 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1598 billion or 63 for the year which resulted from a 33 increase in average daily package volume and a 21 increase in revenue per piece ground volume increased 40 during the year driven in part by the improving us economy and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries ground volume increased 48 during the first nine months of the year but slowed to 15 during the fourth quarter total next day air volume up 08 and total deferred volume down 09 were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume but offset by an increase in next day air package volume the 2004 decline in next day air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing which was notably strong in 2003 

  

index to financial statements ground revenue per piece increased 09 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2004 but growth was adversely impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products as discussed below next day air revenue per piece increased 66 while deferred revenue per piece increased 60 primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages the rate increase and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products 

  

on january 5 2004 we increased rates for standard ground shipments by an average of 19 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 025 to 140 over the commercial ground rate an additional delivery area surcharge of 100 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain zip codes rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 29 and increased rates for deferred services by 29 

  

in addition in 2004 we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during 2004 was 707 compared with the average surcharge of 147 applied to both air and ground products in 2003 resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of 290 million during the year 

  

us domestic package operating profit increased 45 million or 12 primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously but was somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges 91 million in 2004 compared to 69 million in 2003 and a 63 million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data domestic operating margin declined 70 basis points and was impacted by the aircraft impairment and pension charges noted above as well as the sale of our aviation technologies business unit 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pretax gain of 24 million 15 million aftertax or 001 per diluted share which is recorded in other operating expenses within the us domestic package segment the operating results of the aviation technologies unit were previously included in our us domestic package segment and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented 

  

international package operations 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

international package revenue improved 1168 billion or 172 for the year primarily due to the 139 volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements the improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes currency fluctuations and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments revenue increased 121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations net of hedging activity and also increased by 133 million during the year due to business acquisitions 

  

in january 2005 we increased rates 29 for international shipments originating in the united states which includes our worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard services rate changes for international shipments originating outside the united states vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year 

  

in january 2005 we modified the fuel surcharge on us export products by setting a maximum cap of 950 which was increased to 1250 effective in october 2005 the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending upon where the shipment takes place total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by 258 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume 

  

index to financial statements export volume increased throughout the world with strong growth in asia and europe asian export volume which increased 29 for the year was driven by export growth from china asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network including the additional flights from shanghai china that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004 and express air service between the us and guangzhou china that began in the second quarter of 2005 european export volume increased 13 for the year while export volume from the us and americas also showed solid increases international domestic volume increased 124 for the year due to volume growth in canada and europe which also benefited from the acquisition of messenger service stolica sa in poland during the second quarter of 2005 and lynx express ltd in the united kingdom in the third quarter of 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions international domestic volume increased 37 

  

export revenue per piece increased 31 for the year 14 currencyadjusted due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product in total international average daily package volume increased 130 and average revenue per piece increased 40 24 currencyadjusted 

  

the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 345 million for the year or 300 with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points this increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion the increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by 78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense net of hedging activity and by 45 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by 23 million in currency repatriation losses as compared with repatriation gains of 32 million in 2004 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

international package revenue improved 1200 billion or 214 for the year primarily due to the 125 volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements revenue increased 295 million during the year due to currency fluctuations revenue growth was also impacted by the change to our fuel surcharge discussed below as well as rate changes which vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 35 

  

in january 2004 changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products including us export products the surcharge began to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending on where the shipment takes place the surcharge began to be applied only to our international express products while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products these changes along with higher fuel prices had the effect of increasing international package revenue by 231 million during the year 

  

we experienced doubledigit export volume growth in each region throughout the world with the asiapacific region leading with 24 export volume growth including a 101 increase in china export volume export volume continued to benefit from our expanding international network such as the six additional flights to shanghai china that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004 european export volume grew in excess of 10 and was positively influenced by the addition of 10 countries to the european union during the year nonus domestic volume increased 37 for the year and primarily reflected improvements in our european and canadian domestic delivery businesses 

  

export revenue per piece increased 87 for the year 29 currencyadjusted benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge in total international average daily package volume increased 70 and average revenue per piece increased 134 65 currencyadjusted 

  

index to financial statements the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 417 million or 570 for the year 54 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations the remaining increase in operating profit was primarily due to the solid export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously and a strong 380 basis point increase in operating margin primarily due to better network utilization international operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of 19 million in 2004 compared to a 6 million charge in 2003 

  

supply chain  freight operations 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

supply chain  freight revenue increased 3181 billion or 1131 for the year forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by 2358 billion during the year largely due to the acquisition of menlo worldwide forwarding in december 2004 the growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses excluding menlo worldwide forwarding was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations revenue increased by 17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution 

  

during the third quarter of 2005 we completed our acquisition of overnite corp now known as ups freight which offers a variety of lessthantruckload ltl and truckload services to customers in north america overnite’s results have been included in the supply chain  freight reporting segment since the august 5 2005 acquisition date overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the postacquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of ups including improvements in average daily ltl shipments and average ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 

  

the other businesses within supply chain  freight which include our retail franchising business our mail and consulting services and our financial business increased revenue by 60 during the year this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units 

  

operating profit for the supply chain  freight segment increased by 18 million or 130 for the year largely due to the operating profits generated by overnite operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding operations as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by 4 million during the year operating profit also was favorably impacted by 15 million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in “operating expenses” 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

supply chain  freight revenue increased 299 million or 119 for the year freight services and logistics revenue increased by 119 during the year with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses as well as our logistics business the acquisition of menlo worldwide forwarding which was completed in december 2004 increased freight services and logistics revenue by 33 million favorable currency fluctuations provided 73 million of the increase in revenue for the year the other businesses within supply chain  freight which includes our retail franchising business our mail and consulting services and our financial business increased revenue by 119 for the year largely due to strong doubledigit franchise and royalty revenue growth at our retail franchising business resulting from an expanding store base 

  

supply chain  freight operating profit increased 82 million or 1464 and operating margin increased by 270 basis points for the year primarily due to improved results from our financial business largely due to a lower loan loss provision and our mail services business which was affected in 2003 by the sale of our mail technologies business unit as described in the next paragraph our retail franchising business also experienced profit growth due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously these increases were partially offset by somewhat lower profits at our freight services and logistics operations 

  

index to financial statements during the second quarter of 2003 we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by 14 million or 001 per diluted share the gain consisted of a pretax loss of 24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the supply chain  freight segment and a tax benefit of 38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale the tax benefit exceeded the pretax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes consequently our tax basis was greater than our book basis thus producing the tax benefit described above the operating results of the mail technologies unit were previously included in our supply chain  freight segment and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented 

  

operating expenses 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 4845 billion or 153 for the year and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite operating expenses also increased 56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations net of hedging activity in our international package and supply chain  freight segments and increased 55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our international package segment 

  

compensation and benefits increased by 1694 billion or 81 for the year largely due to the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans stockbased and other management incentive compensation expense decreased 297 million or 334 in the year due to a change in our management incentive awards program implemented in 2005 described in the next paragraph which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 beginning with 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  

during the first quarter of 2005 we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units “rsus” the rsus granted in november 2005 under this program have a fiveyear graded vesting period with approximately 20 of the total rsu award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant the other half of the award granted in november 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant this change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense as a result 2005 expense for our management incentive awards program reported in operating expenses under “compensation and benefits” including the rsus decreased 334 million 213 million aftertax or 019 per diluted share compared with 2004 

  

other operating expenses increased by 3151 billion or 293 for the year largely due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite acquisitions as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation the 472 increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher fuel usage but was partially mitigated with hedging gains the 967 increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition but was also influenced by volume growth in our international package business and higher fuel prices the 92 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts partially affected by the overnite acquisition airframe and aircraft engine maintenance the 65 increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings largely due to acquisitions aircraft and capitalized software the 160 increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our supply chain  freight segment which was impacted by the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition and increased utilities expense the 45 increase in other expenses was primarily due to the overnite acquisition but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the 110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004 

  

index to financial statements 2004 compared to 2003 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 2553 billion or 88 for the year 311 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain  freight segments compensation and benefits increased by 1572 billion or 82 for the year largely due to increased payroll costs increased health and welfare expense and higher pension expense for our union pension plans stockbased compensation expense increased 167 million or 232 during the year primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 prospectively beginning with 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  

other operating expenses increased by 981 million or 100 for the year largely due to a 349 increase in fuel expense and a 126 increase in purchased transportation but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense the increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency higher fuel prices and volume growth in our international package business the decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance the increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes the increase in other expenses was affected by the 110 million impairment of aircraft engines and parts as well as the 63 million pension charge discussed previously in addition to higher advertising costs 

  

investment income and interest expense 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

the increase in investment income of 22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing shortterm interest rates in the united states but partially offset by a lower average balance of interestearning investments increased equitymethod losses on certain investment partnerships and an investment impairment charge on certain availableforsale securities we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost overall economic and market conditions and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer after considering these factors we recorded an impairment charge of 16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 

  

the 23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

investment income increased by 64 million during the year primarily due to a 58 million impairment charge recognized during 2003 during the first quarter of 2003 after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets we recognized an impairment charge of 58 million primarily related to our investment in sp 500 equity portfolios investment income also increased in 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances but was somewhat offset by increased equitymethod losses on certain investment partnerships 

  

the 28 million increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships the impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

index to financial statements in december 2003 we redeemed 300 million in cashsettled convertible senior notes at a price of 102703 and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes the redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption which along with the cash settlement received on the swap resulted in a 28 million nonoperating gain recorded in 2003 results 

  

net income and earnings per share 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

net income for 2005 was 3870 billion a 161 increase from the 3333 billion achieved in 2004 resulting in an 184 increase in diluted earnings per share to 347 in 2005 from 293 in 2004 the increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our us domestic and international package segments net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 363 in 2005 from 323 in 2004 the lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling 142 million 013 per diluted share related to various items including the resolution of certain tax matters the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items 

  

net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a 70 million aftertax impairment charge 006 per diluted share on boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft engines and parts as well as a 40 million aftertax charge 004 per diluted share to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

2004 net income was 3333 billion a 150 increase from the 2898 billion in 2003 resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to 293 in 2004 from 255 in 2003 net income in 2004 was impacted by the aircraft impairment pension charge and tax items discussed previously 

  

net income in 2003 was favorably impacted by the 14 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of mail technologies the 15 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of aviation technologies and the 18 million aftertax gain 002 per diluted share recognized upon redemption of our 300 million cashsettled senior convertible notes net income in 2003 was adversely impacted by the 37 million aftertax investment impairment charge 003 per diluted share described previously net income in 2003 was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of 116 million 010 per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the irs a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs and a lower effective state tax rate 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash from operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 5793 5331 and 4576 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in 2005 operating cash flows compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher net income but partially offset by higher pension and retirement plan fundings in 2005 we funded 995 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to 585 million in 2004 as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2006 are projected to be approximately 828 million in 2005 we received a 374 million tax refund associated with the 19851990 settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” reached previously primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance in 2004 we received 610 million from a tax settlement with the irs for tax years 198384 and 199198 

  

on november 18 2005 we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on january 2 2006 we increased rates 55 on ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and 

  

index to financial statements 39 on ups ground we also increased rates 55 for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service other pricing changes include a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our delivery required and signature confirmation services the residential surcharge increased 025 for ups ground services and 035 for ups next day air ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select these rate changes are customary and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases additionally in january 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by reducing by 2 the index used to determine the fuel surcharge the air fuel surcharge continues to remain subject to a maximum cap of 125 the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department’s onhighway diesel fuel price rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 

  

net cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 975 million 3638 billion and 2742 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the net sales of marketable securities and shortterm investments to fund business acquisitions and the aforementioned benefit plan contributions in 2005 we spent 1488 billion on business acquisitions primarily overnite corp lynx express ltd in the united kingdom messenger service stolica sa in poland and the express operations of sinotrans air transportation development co ltd in china in 2004 we spent 238 million on business acquisitions primarily menlo worldwide forwarding inc and the 49 minority interest in yamato express co in japan see note 7 we expect to make additional payments related to business acquisitions of approximately 50 million during 2006 primarily related to the sinotrans transaction we generated cash of 95 and 318 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables primarily in our leasing assetbased lending and receivable factoring businesses 

  

capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities as follows in millions 

  

   

as described in the “commitments” section below we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft vehicles equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 4175 2014 and 2110 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock pay dividends and repay longterm debt in august 2005 the board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion for future share repurchases in addition to the amount remaining under our october 2004 share repurchase authorization we repurchased a total of 339 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 2479 billion in 2005 and 181 million shares for 1310 billion in 2004 as of december 31 2005 we had 1338 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining 

  

we increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to 033 per share in 2005 from 028 per share in 2004 resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 1391 billion from 1208 billion the declaration of 

  

index to financial statements dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 

  

during 2005 we repaid 589 million in debt primarily consisting of paydowns of commercial paper scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations and repayments of debt that was previously assumed with the acquisitions of lynx express ltd and overnite corp issuances of debt were 128 million in 2005 and consisted primarily of loans related to our investment in certain equitymethod real estate partnerships we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

  

sources of credit 

  

we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to 70 billion in the united states we had 739 million outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2005 with an average interest rate of 401 the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €10 billion in a variety of currencies there were no amounts outstanding under this program as of december 31 2005 

  

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of 10 billion each with one expiring on april 20 2006 and the other on april 21 2010 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december 31 2005 

  

in august 2003 we filed a 20 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states there was approximately 126 million issued under this shelf registration statement at december 31 2005 all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 

  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants these covenants generally require us to maintain a 30 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company and all covenant tests were satisfied as of december 31 2005 

  

commitments 

  

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases capital leases debt obligations purchase commitments and certain other liabilities we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2005 in millions 

  

   

index to financial statements during 2005 we took delivery of six boeing md11 aircraft and seven airbus a300600 aircraft the final six firm airbus a300600 aircraft are scheduled for delivery by july 2006 we have firm commitments to purchase 13 boeing md11 aircraft and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2006 and 2007 in 2005 we made firm commitments to purchase eight boeing 747400f aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008 and two boeing 747400sf aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008 in addition we have a firm commitment to purchase 10 airbus a380 aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional a380 aircraft the a380 aircraft deliveries are scheduled between 2009 and 2012 these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 2095 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements as of december 31 2005 we had unfunded loan commitments totaling 416 million associated with our financial business 

  

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods and interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1200 fulltime supervisors 

  

we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

with the assistance of outside counsel we have undertaken an internal investigation of certain conduct within our supply chain solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the united states our investigation has determined that certain conduct which commenced prior to our subsidiary’s 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of fritz companies inc may have violated the united states foreign corrupt practices act our investigation also determined that a small number of former employees directed the conduct in question the monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial we have implemented numerous remediation steps and our investigation continues in march 2006 we informed the sec and the department of justice of our investigation and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues we do not believe that the results of this investigation the remediation or related penalties if any will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

  

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 241000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood 

  

index to financial statements of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2008 the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which became amendable december 31 2003 negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which becomes amendable on november 1 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers these agreements run through july 31 2009 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

  

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled  

  

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline which are used in the transportation of packages additionally we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products primarily natural gas and electricity used in our operating facilities throughout the world we use a combination of options swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2005 and 2004 was an asset of 192 and 101 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 35 and 32 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the net fair value of the hedging instruments 

  

index to financial statements described above was an asset liability of 52 and 28 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 65 and 117 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

  

interest rate risk 

  

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 

  

our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at both december 31 2005 and 2004 would be approximately 29 million 

  

as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have certain investments in debt auction rate and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2005 and 2004 would be approximately 14 and 45 million respectively 

  

additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2005 and 2004 would be immaterial 

  

this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

  

equity price risk 

  

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2005 and 2004 the fair value of such investments was 89 and 77 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 9 and 8 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

credit risk 

  

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 

  

index to financial statements new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” which replaces fas 123 and supercedes apb 25 fas 123r requires all sharebased awards to employees including grants of employee stock options to be measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the vesting period we had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the original fas 123 prospectively for all new stock compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to january 1 2003 fas 123r was effective beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 the sec deferred the effective date and as a result we adopted fas 123r on january 1 2006 on that date there were no unvested stock options or other forms of employee stock compensation issued prior to january 1 2003 

  

we issue employee sharebased awards under our incentive compensation plan that are subject to specific vesting conditions generally the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period “the nominal vesting period” or at the date the employee retires as defined by the plan if earlier for awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement we account for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach under this approach we record compensation expense over the nominal vesting period if the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement 

  

upon our adoption of fas 123r we will revise our approach to apply the nonsubstantive vesting period approach to all new sharebased compensation awards under this approach compensation cost will be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirementeligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period we will continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to january 1 2006 and for the remaining portion of the then unvested outstanding awards 

  

if we had accounted for all sharebased compensation awards granted prior to january 1 2006 under the nonsubstantive vesting period approach the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods the adoption of the nonsubstantive vesting period approach is expected to reduce 2006 net income by an estimated 29 million or 003 per diluted share based on sharebased awards that we are anticipating granting in 2006 

  

the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

   

   

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

index to financial statements contingencies —as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

  

the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time a contingency is identified we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas 5 evaluation we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas 5 these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas 5 excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to the company’s financial position as of december 31 2005 in addition we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31 2005 because a loss is not reasonably estimable 

  

goodwill impairment —we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 

  

we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the fair value of our goodwill the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows these assumptions include projections of future revenue costs and working capital changes in addition we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables as required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

  

as of december 31 2005 our recorded goodwill was 2549 billion of which 2259 billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made because of its growth this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments our annual impairment tests performed in 2005 2004 and 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment 

  

selfinsurance accruals —we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

  

workers compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle consequently actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim including the length of time 

  

index to financial statements the claim remains open trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation furthermore claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our selfinsurance accruals all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

  

we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees we use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation actual results may differ from these estimates and therefore produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 

  

pension and postretirement medical benefits —our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company’s costs and obligations for the year 2005 in millions 

  

   

financial instruments —as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve 

  

index to financial statements volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices is presented in the “market risk” section of this report 

  

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets —as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 15289 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

  

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

  

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “fas 144” we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or external appraisals as applicable we review longlived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flows we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business adverse changes in these volume forecasts or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 

  

in december 2003 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft as a result we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines 69 million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and 6 million of which impacted the international package segment 

  

in december 2004 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines and parts 91 million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and 19 million of which impacted the international package segment 

  

these charges are classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2005 

  

income taxes —we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these 

  

index to financial statements jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events including the impact of adjustments if any resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carryforward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based in part on estimates of future taxable income a valuation allowance is established for the portion if any of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate in this regard we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 

  

during 2004 and 2003 the resolution of tax matters with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of 142 and 77 million respectively

competitive strengths 

  

our competitive strengths include 

  

global reach and scale we believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry it is the only network that handles all levels of service express ground domestic international commercial residential through one integrated pickup and delivery service system

in europe where we have operated for nearly 30 years we maintain a well developed air and ground network much like that in the us we believe we have the most comprehensive integrated delivery and information services portfolio of any carrier in europe in other regions of the world we rely on both our own and local service providers’ capabilities to meet our service commitments 

  

through more than two dozen alliances with asian delivery companies that supplement companyowned operations we currently serve more than 40 asia pacific countries and territories the two fastest growing economies in the world china and india are among our most promising opportunities 

  

we are also the largest air cargo carrier and a leading logistics provider in latin america and the caribbean 

  

our canadian operations include both intracanada and importexport capabilities we deliver to all addresses throughout canada we are also the only carrier to offer guaranteed 800 am next day delivery to most major metropolitan cities in canada 

  

technology we are a global leader in developing technology that improves our customers’ business processes we have a strong global capability as a mover of electronic information we currently collect electronic data on 95 of the packages that move through our us system each day – more than any of our competitors 

  

in 2003 we announced plans to reengineer our package pickup and delivery processes over several years beginning in 2003 we expect to invest 600 million to simplify and optimize these processes which we believe will result in significant gains in efficiency reliability and flexibility once the new technology is fully deployed in over 1000 of our package sorting facilities which we estimate will be completed in 2007 we anticipate achieving hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced operating costs annually these savings will be realized through productivity improvements as well as in reduced fuel usage from driving an estimated 100 million fewer miles each year by the end of 2004 we had deployed this technology in 273 of our package centers for use by almost 45 of our drivers 

  

technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform our technology initiatives are driven by our customers’ needs we offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate ups functionality into their own businesses not only to conveniently send manage and track their shipments but to provide their customers with better information services we provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated ups tools directly into their own web sites 

  

ecommerce capabilities we are a leading facilitator of global ecommerce according to forrester research by 2008 us online retail sales are forecasted to reach 271 billion 1 we enable our customers around the world to thrive in this environment by providing a portfolio of technology solutions that streamlines their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their business applications 

  

broad flexible range of services and integrated solutions our portfolio of services enables customers to choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements all of our general service offering small package delivery services are guaranteed 

  

our express air services are integrated with our vast ground delivery system – one system handling all products this integrated air and ground network enhances efficiency improves productivity and asset utilization and provides us with the flexibility to transport packages using the most reliable and costeffective transportation mode or combination of modes our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis this unique integrated global business model creates consistent and superior returns – by far the best in our industry 

  

   

increasingly our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many ups services in addition to package delivery we offer over 60 supply chain services – such as freight forwarding customs brokerage order fulfillment and returns management – that help improve efficiency of the supply chain management process 

  

customer relationships we focus on building and maintaining longterm customer relationships thousands of customers access us daily through ups oncall pickup sm for air and ground delivery services in addition there are almost 150000 domestic and international access points to ups these include nearly 40000 dropboxes more than 1000 ups customer centers over 2300 alliance partner locations over 5000 independentlyowned authorized shipping outlets asos almost 1300 national aso chains approximately 10200 commercial counters more than 5000 independently owned and operated the ups store ® and mail boxes etc ® locations worldwide over 4000 in the us – along with 80000 ups drivers who can accept packages given to them

brand equity we have built a leading and trusted brand in our industry – a brand that stands for quality service reliability and product innovation the distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the friendliness and helpfulness of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity 

  

in 2003 we introduced our first new logo in 42 years the change was more than cosmetic it signaled our commitment to provide more comprehensive solutions to meet our customers’ needs and to be the leader of the broader business arena of synchronized commerce 

  

distinctive culture we believe that the dedication of our employees results in large part from our distinctive “employeeowner” concept our employee stock ownership tradition dates from 1927 when our founders who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business first offered stock to employees to facilitate employee stock ownership we maintain several stockbased compensation programs 

  

our longstanding policy of “promotion from within” complements our tradition of employee ownership and this policy makes it generally unnecessary for us to hire managers and executive officers from outside ups the vast majority of our management team began their careers as fulltime or parttime hourly ups employees and have spent their entire careers with us our chief executive officer and many of our executive officers have more than 30 years of service with ups and have accumulated a meaningful ownership stake in our company therefore our executive officers have a strong incentive to effectively manage ups which benefits all our shareowners 

  

financial strength our balance sheet reflects financial strength that few companies can match as of december 31 2004 we had a balance of cash cash equivalents marketable securities and shortterm investments of approximately 52 billion and shareowners’ equity of 164 billion longterm debt was 33 billion we carry longterm debt ratings of aaaaaa from standard  poor’s and moody’s respectively reflecting our low use of debt and strong capacity to service our obligations our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale and to make investments in technology transportation equipment and buildings as well as to pursue strategic opportunities which will facilitate our growth 

  

growth strategy 

  

our growth strategy takes advantage of our competitive strengths while maintaining our focus on meeting or exceeding our customers’ requirements the principal components of our growth strategy are 

  

build on our leadership position in our us business we believe that our tradition of reliable package delivery service our experienced and dedicated employees and our unmatched integrated air and ground network provide us with the advantages of reputation service quality and economies of scale that differentiate us from our 

  

competitors our strategy is to increase domestic revenue through crossselling our existing and new services to our large and diverse customer base to limit the rate of expense growth and to employ technologydriven efficiencies to increase operating profit 

  

continued international expansion we have built a strong international presence through significant investments over several decades the international package delivery market continues to grow at a faster rate than that of the us we will use our worldwide infrastructure and broad product portfolio to grow highmargin premium services and to implement cost process and technology improvements in our international operations 

  

europe is our largest region outside the united states – accounting for half of our international revenue both europe and asia offer significant opportunities for growth the expansion of the european union to include several eastern european and baltic countries will create even greater economic cohesion growth in asia will be driven by global demand leading to improved demographic and economic trends throughout the region with specific emphasis on china and india 

  

provide comprehensive supply chain solutions many businesses outsource the management of all or part of their supply chains to streamline and gain efficiencies to strengthen their balance sheets to support new business models and to improve service companies’ global supply chains are growing increasingly complicated this is creating further demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation distribution and international trade services with financial and information services we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

leverage our leadingedge technology and ecommerce advantage our goal is to provide our customers with easytouse flexible technology offerings that streamline their shipment processing and integrate critical transportation information into their business processes helping them create supply chain efficiencies improve their cash flows and better serve their customers our leadingedge technology has enabled our ecommerce partners to integrate our shipping functionality and information solutions into their ecommerce product suites

we believe that there is longterm potential for us to expand our service offerings in latin america to this end we have realigned our delivery capabilities between key cities in the mercosur and other trade blocs and continue to benefit from our americas international gateway in miami florida this gateway complements our operations in florida and latin america and represents our commitment to the americas market 

  

mexico and canada are also important to our international business we developed the ups trade direct sm cross border service to manage package movements between the us and these countries this service combines our small package freight and brokerage capabilities to create an integrated streamlined and economical doortodoor solution for customers with complex crossborder distribution needs 

  

the trade direct portfolio of services integrates our small package and supply chain solutions capabilities to provide additional value to our customers in essence the trade direct service consolidates individually labeled packages or pallets into one movement across borders when the goods arrive in the destination country packages are deconsolidated and entered into the ups system for delivery often eliminating the receiving sorting and handling necessary in distribution centers this service significantly cuts the supply chain cycle from point of origin to consignee it also provides our customers with faster time to market reduced costs increased visibility and better management of their global supply chain

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

on august 9 1999 the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value “ev” package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998 on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance under the terms of settlement we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately 562 million additions to tax of 60 million and related interest the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as a result we recorded income before taxes of 1023 billion 776 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2002 in the first quarter of 2004 we received a refund of 185 million pertaining to the 1983 and 1984 tax years 

  

the irs had proposed adjustments unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary the treatment of certain income and our entitlement to tax credits in the 1985 through 1998 tax years in the third quarter of 2004 we settled all outstanding issues related to each of the tax years 1991 through 1998 in the fourth quarter of 2004 we received a refund of 425 million pertaining to the 1991 through 1998 tax years we expect to receive the 371 million of refunds related to the 1985 through 1990 tax years within the next six months 

  

the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of the nonev package insurance matters for each of the years 1999 through 2004 if challenged we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues specifically we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we were named as a defendant in twentythree nowdismissed lawsuits that sought to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 based on state and federal tort contract and statutory claims these cases generally claimed that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer we failed to provide promised ev insurance we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations and the price for ev insurance was excessive these actions were all filed after the august 9 1999 us tax court decision discussed above which the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit later reversed 

  

these twentythree cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york in addition to the cases in which ups was named as a defendant there also was an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc centers that case also was consolidated into the mdl proceeding 

  

in late 2003 the parties reached a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding in reaching the settlement we and the other defendants expressly denied any and all liability on july 30 2004 the court issued an order granting final approval to the substantive terms of the settlement no appeals were filed and the settlement became effective on september 8 2004 

  

pursuant to the settlement ups has provided qualifying settlement class members with vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and will pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees the total amount of which still remains to be determined by the court other defendants have contributed to the costs of the settlement including the attorneys’ fees the ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors including how many vouchers settlement class members actually use we do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which has been certified as a class action in california state court plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime penalties for missed meal and rest periods interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1200 fulltime supervisors 

  

we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

in addition we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans

us domestic package operations 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1588 billion or 63 for the year which resulted from a 33 increase in average daily package volume and a 21 increase in revenue per piece ground volume increased 40 during the year driven in part by the improving us economy and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries ground volume increased 48 during the first nine months of the year but slowed to 15 during the fourth quarter total next day air volume up 08 and total deferred volume down 09 were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume but offset by an increase in next day air package volume the 2004 decline in next day air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing which was notably strong in 2003 

  

ground revenue per piece increased 09 for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2004 but growth was adversely impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products as discussed below next day air revenue per piece increased 66 while deferred revenue per piece increased 61 primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages the rate increase and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products 

  

on january 5 2004 a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 19 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 025 to 140 over the commercial ground rate an additional delivery area surcharge of 100 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain zip codes rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 29 and increased rates for deferred services by 29 

  

in addition we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel based on published rates the 

  

average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during 2004 was 707 compared with the average surcharge of 147 applied to both air and ground products in 2003 resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of 290 million during the year 

  

us domestic package operating profit increased 73 million or 22 primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously but somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges 91 million in 2004 compared to 69 million in 2003 and a 63 million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

us domestic package revenue increased 1098 billion or 46 for the year which was driven by a 21 increase in average daily package volume and a 26 increase in revenue per piece ground volume increased by 15 in 2003 reversing a 20 decline in 2002 reflecting the improving us economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002 the volume for our ups next day air products increased by 67 during the year driven by doubledigit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during 2003 the increase in us domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 total us domestic average daily package volume increased 32 and 49 respectively 

  

the overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in january 2003 with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below the decline in revenue per piece for the next day air products and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products 

  

on january 6 2003 we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 39 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 005 to 115 over the commercial ground rate the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain zip codes increased 025 to 175 rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 34 and increased rates for deferred services by 45 

  

during 2003 the indexbased fuel surcharge reset on a monthly basis and was based on the national us average onhighway diesel fuel prices as reported by the us department of energy based on published rates the average fuel surcharge increased to 147 in 2003 from 078 in 2002 resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of 144 million effective in 2004 we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service while an indexed surcharge was applied to our next day air and deferred products this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products was based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel 

  

us domestic package operating profit declined 304 million or 85 primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses discussed further below under the section titled “operating expenses and operating margin” us domestic package operating profit increased 20 in the third quarter and decreased by 94 in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of 2002 us domestic package operating profit benefited from a 175 million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees 

  

international package operations 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

international package revenue improved 1201 billion or 216 for the year primarily due to the 125 volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements revenue increased 295 million during the year due to currency fluctuations revenue growth was also impacted by the change to our fuel surcharge discussed below as well as rate changes which vary by geographical market and occur throughout 

  

the year rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 35 

  

in january 2004 changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products including us export products the surcharge is now indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions depending on where the shipment takes place the current surcharge is only applied to our international express products while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products these changes along with higher fuel prices had the effect of increasing international package revenue by 231 million during the year 

  

we experienced doubledigit export volume growth in each region throughout the world with the asiapacific region leading with 24 export volume growth including a 101 increase in china export volume export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international network such as the six additional flights to shanghai china that were added in the fourth quarter european export volume grew in excess of 10 and was positively influenced by the addition of 10 countries to the european union nonus domestic volume increased 37 for the year and primarily reflects improvements in our european and canadian domestic delivery businesses 

  

export revenue per piece increased 90 for the year 31 currencyadjusted benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge in total international average daily package volume increased 70 and average revenue per piece increased 136 67 currencyadjusted 

  

the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 412 million or 581 for the year 54 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations this increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously and a strong increase in operating margin through better network utilization international operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of 19 million in 2004 compared to a 6 million charge in 2003 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

international package revenue improved 881 million or 188 for the year due primarily to the 86 volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency revenue increased 443 million during the year due to currency fluctuations export volume increased throughout the world with asiapacific canada and the americas showing doubledigit export volume growth and us and european export volume increasing slightly over 6 european export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the euro and the weak european economy domestic volume increased 09 for the year reversing a 32 decline from the previous year which was also negatively affected by the weak european economy 

  

export revenue per piece increased 125 for the year 33 currencyadjusted due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management in total international average daily package volume increased 37 and average revenue per piece increased 174 62 currencyadjusted the 76 decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the americas 

  

rates for international shipments originating in the united states ups worldwide express ups worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased an average of 39 rate changes for shipments originating outside the united states generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

  

the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 387 million for the year 117 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations this increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously in 2002 international operating profit benefited from an 11 million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees 

  

nonpackage operations 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

nonpackage revenue increased 308 million or 106 for the year ups supply chain solutions increased revenue by 103 during the year with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses as well as our logistics business favorable currency fluctuations provided 73 million of the increase in revenue for the year the remainder of our nonpackage operations which includes mail boxes etc the franchisor of mail boxes etc and the ups store ups capital our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business increased revenue by 113 for the year largely due to strong doubledigit franchise and royalty revenue growth at mail boxes etc resulting from an expanding store base as well as higher excess value insurance revenue menlo worldwide forwarding which was acquired in december 2004 added 33 million in revenue 

  

nonpackage operating profit increased 59 million or 127 for the year primarily due to improved results from our ups capital mail services and excess value insurance business mail boxes etc experienced strong profit growth due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously nonpackage operating profit includes 112 million compared to 114 million in 2003 of intersegment profit for the year with a corresponding amount of operating expense which reduces operating profit in the us domestic package segment 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by 14 million or 001 per diluted share the gain consisted of a pretax loss of 24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the nonpackage segment and a tax benefit of 38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale the tax benefit exceeded the pretax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes consequently our tax basis was greater than our book basis thus producing the tax benefit described above 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pretax gain of 24 million 15 million aftertax or 001 per diluted share which is recorded in other operating expenses within the nonpackage segment the operating results of both the mail technologies unit and the aviation technologies unit were previously included in our nonpackage segment and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

nonpackage revenue increased 234 million or 88 for the year ups supply chain solutions increased revenue by 80 during the year this increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses with international revenues growing faster than in the united states partially as a result of favorable currency fluctuations favorable currency fluctuations accounted for 74 million of the increase in revenue freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at us west coast ports the remainder of our nonpackage operations which includes mail boxes etc the franchisor of mail boxes etc and the ups store ups capital our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business increased revenue by 110 for the year primarily due to increased franchise revenue at mail boxes etc and improvements from our mail innovations unit 

  

nonpackage operating profit increased 266 million or 1343 for the year this increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our supply chain solutions unit which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program nonpackage operating profit in 2002 was reduced by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses and was increased by 11 million due to the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees nonpackage operating profit includes 114 million compared to 112 million in 2002 of intersegment profit with a corresponding amount of operating expense which reduces operating profit in the us domestic package segment 

  

operating expenses and operating margin 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 2553 billion or 88 for the year 311 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and nonpackage segments compensation and benefits increased by 1588 billion or 82 for the year largely due to increased payroll costs increased health and welfare expense and higher pension expense for our union pension plans stockbased compensation expense increased 167 million or 232 during the year primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 prospectively beginning with 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  

other operating expenses increased by 965 million or 99 for the year largely due to a 349 increase in fuel expense and a 126 increase in purchased transportation but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense the increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency higher fuel prices and volume growth in our international package business the decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance the increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes the increase in other expenses was affected by the 110 million impairment of aircraft engines and parts as well as the 63 million pension charge discussed previously in addition to higher advertising costs 

  

our consolidated operating margin defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased in 2004 compared with 2003 the operating margins for our three business segments were as follows 

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

consolidated operating expenses increased by 1864 billion or 69 for the year 398 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and nonpackage segments compensation and benefits increased by 1388 billion or 77 for the year primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense stockbased compensation expense totaled 724 million in 2003 a 140 increase over 2002 primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 for 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  

other operating expenses increased by 476 million or 52 for the year largely due to a 123 increase in occupancy costs a 103 increase in fuel expense and smaller increases in purchased transportation repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization other operating expenses in 2002 were affected by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations into our ups supply chain solutions unit the growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities higher real estate taxes and weatherrelated increases in natural gas and utilities expense the fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003 somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage the increase in purchased transportation expense was 

  

influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and supply chain solutions businesses the growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft the completion of facilities projects including ups worldport and increased amortization of capitalized software the increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle aircraft and equipment maintenance expense 

  

the increase in other expenses was primarily due to a 75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of boeing 727 and dc8 aircraft from service 

  

investment incomeinterest expense 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

investment income increased by 64 million during the year primarily due to a 58 million impairment charge recognized during 2003 we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost overall economic and market conditions and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer during the first quarter of 2003 after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets we recognized an impairment charge of 58 million primarily related to our investment in sp 500 equity portfolios investment income also increased in 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances but was somewhat offset by increased equitymethod losses on certain investment partnerships 

  

the 28 million increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships the impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

in december 2003 we redeemed 300 million in cashsettled convertible senior notes at a price of 102703 and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes the redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption which along with the cash settlement received on the swap resulted in a 28 million nonoperating gain recorded in 2003 results 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the decrease in investment income of 45 million in 2003 is primarily due to the 58 million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003 the 52 million decline in interest expense in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding lower interest rates on variable rate debt and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps 

  

net income and earnings per share 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

2004 net income was 3333 billion a 150 increase from the 2898 billion in 2003 resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to 293 in 2004 from 255 in 2003 net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a 70 million aftertax impairment charge 006 per diluted share on boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft engines and parts as well as a 40 million aftertax charge 004 per diluted share to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data net income was positively impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling 142 million 013 per diluted share related to various items including the resolution of certain tax matters the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items 

  

net income in 2003 was favorably impacted by the 14 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of mail technologies the 15 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of aviation technologies and the 18 million aftertax gain 002 per diluted share recognized upon redemption of our 300 million cashsettled senior convertible notes net income in 2003 was adversely impacted by the 37 million aftertax investment impairment charge 003 per diluted share described previously net income in 2003 was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of 116 million 010 per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the irs a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs and a lower effective state tax rate 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

net income for 2003 was 2898 billion a decrease of 284 million from the 3182 billion achieved in 2002 resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to 255 in 2003 from 281 in 2002 net income in 2003 was affected by the items noted above net income in 2002 was favorably impacted by a 776 million aftertax 068 per diluted share benefit resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability and by 121 million aftertax 011 per diluted share from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees net income in 2002 was adversely impacted by 65 million aftertax 006 per diluted share due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by 72 million aftertax 006 per diluted share due to the fas 142 cumulative expense adjustment 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash from operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 5331 4576 and 5688 billion in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in 2004 operating cash flows compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher net income decreased pension and retirement plan fundings and cash received upon the resolution of various tax matters in 2004 we funded 450 million to our pension plans as compared to 1136 billion in 2003 as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements projected pension contributions to plan trusts in 2005 are approximately 723 million in 2004 we received 610 million from our previously disclosed settlement with the internal revenue service irs primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance for tax years 198384 and 199198 see “contingencies” section below as of december 31 2004 we had a 371 million receivable recorded for the settlement related to tax years 198590

net cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 3638 2742 and 3281 billion in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the primary reason for the increased cash used in investing activities has been the increasing net purchases of marketable securities due to the excess of cash generated over our capital investment needs the increase in funds used for business acquisitions is primarily due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and ups 

  

yamato express co acquisitions in 2004 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the cash generated from finance receivables was primarily due to principal payments on finance receivables and sales of portions of our portfolio primarily in the receivable factoring business

we increased our cash dividends per share to 112 in 2004 from 092 in 2003 resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 1208 billion from 956 million the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2005 the board of directors declared a 033 per share dividend which represents a 179 increase over the 028 previous quarterly dividend the dividend is payable on march 9 2005 to shareowners of record on february 22 2005 

  

during 2004 we repaid 468 million in debt primarily consisting of 264 million in commercial paper 56 million in redemptions of ups notes 57 million in scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations and 60 million for the redemption of our singapore dollar notes issue issuances of debt primarily consisted of 735 million in commercial paper and 41 million in ups notes we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt 

  

sources of credit 

  

we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to 70 billion approximately 1015 billion was outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2004 with an average interest rate of 210 the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet in addition we maintain an extendable commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 500 million no amounts were outstanding under this program at december 31 2004 

  

we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of 10 billion each with one expiring on april 21 2005 and the other on april 24 2008 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december 31 2004 

  

in august 2003 we filed a 20 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states there was approximately 126 million issued under this shelf registration statement at december 31 2004 all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 

  

our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have crossdefault or ratings triggers however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants these covenants generally require us to maintain a 30 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company and all covenant tests were passed as of december 31 2004 

  

commitments 

  

we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases capital leases debt obligations and purchase commitments we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2004 in millions 

  

   

in december 2004 we amended our existing aircraft purchase agreement with airbus industries the amended agreement will reduce airbus a300600 aircraft on order from 50 to 13 and the number of options on this aircraft from 37 to zero these 13 aircraft remaining on order will be delivered to ups by july 2006 additionally we placed a firm order for 10 airbus a380 freighter aircraft and obtained options to purchase 10 additional a380 aircraft the airbus a380 aircraft will be delivered to ups between 2009 and 2012 the purchase commitments information above reflects the amended agreement 

  

in january 2005 we also announced an agreement to purchase an additional 11 boeing md11 preowned aircraft these aircraft will be delivered to ups between 2005 and 2007 

  

we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases for the foreseeable future 

  

contingencies 

  

on august 9 1999 the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value “ev” insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998 on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance under the terms of settlement we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately 562 million additions to tax of 60 million and related interest the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as a result we recorded income before taxes of 1023 billion 776 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2002 in the first quarter of 2004 we received a refund of 185 million pertaining to the 1983 and 1984 tax years 

  

the irs had proposed adjustments unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary the treatment of certain income and our entitlement to tax credits in the 1985 through 1998 tax years in the third quarter of 2004 we settled all outstanding issues related to each of the tax years 1991 through 1998 in the fourth quarter of 2004 we received a refund of 425 million pertaining to the 1991 through 1998 tax years we expect to receive the 371 million of refunds related to the 1985 through 1990 tax years within the next six months 

  

the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of the nonev package insurance matters for each of the years 1999 through 2004 if challenged we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues specifically we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we were named as a defendant in twentythree nowdismissed lawsuits that sought to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 based on state and federal tort contract and statutory claims these cases generally claimed that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer we failed to provide promised ev insurance we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations and the price for ev insurance was excessive these actions were all filed after the august 9 1999 us tax court decision discussed above which the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit later reversed 

  

these twentythree cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york in addition to the cases in which ups was named as a defendant there also was an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc centers that case also was consolidated into the mdl proceeding 

  

in late 2003 the parties reached a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding in reaching the settlement we and the other defendants expressly denied any and all liability on july 30 2004 the court issued an order granting final approval to the substantive terms of the settlement no appeals were filed and the settlement became effective on september 8 2004 

  

pursuant to the settlement ups has provided qualifying settlement class members with vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and will pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees the total amount of which still remains to be determined by the court other defendants have contributed to the costs of the settlement including the attorneys’ fees the ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors including how many vouchers settlement class members actually use we do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state courts containing various classaction allegations under state wageandhour laws in one of these cases marlo v ups which has been certified as a class action in california state court plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime penalties for missed meal and rest periods interest and attorneys’ fees plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1200 fulltime supervisors 

  

we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases at this time we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability if any would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

in addition we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans 

  

due to the events of september 11 2001 increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming however we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in addition our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions including selfinsuring certain risks to mitigate the expense increase 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 229000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2008 the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which became amendable january 1 2004 negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which becomes amendable on november 1 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers these agreements run through july 31 2009 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

  

the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled  

  

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline which are used in the transportation of packages additionally we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products primarily natural gas and electricity used in our operating facilities throughout the world we use a combination of options swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying 

  

exposures as of december 31 2004 and 2003 was an asset of 101 and 30 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 32 and 17 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was a liability of 28 and 48 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 117 and 97 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

  

interest rate risk 

  

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have issued debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 

  

our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december 31 2004 and 2003 would be approximately 29 and 25 million respectively 

  

as described in note 1 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have certain investments in debt auction rate and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2004 and 2003 would be approximately 45 and 31 million respectively 

  

additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2004 and 2003 would be immaterial 

  

this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

  

equity price risk 

  

we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2004 and 2003 the fair value of such investments was 77 and 95 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 8 and 10 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

credit risk 

  

the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” which replaces fas 123 and supercedes apb 25 fas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june 15 2005 with early adoption encouraged we will adopt fas 123r in the third quarter of 2005 using the prospective method of adoption the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas 123r there will be no impact upon adoption as we will already be expensing all unvested option and restricted stock awards 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp 1092” fsp 1092 provides guidance under fas 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability the jobs act was enacted on october 22 2004 fsp 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas 109 we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act accordingly as provided for in fsp 1092 we have not adjusted our income tax provision or deferred tax liabilities to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 

  

the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

contingencies —as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 

  

goodwill impairment —the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” in june 2001 as a result of the issuance of this standard goodwill is no longer amortized but is subjected to annual impairment testing goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units upon adoption of fas 142 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 72 million 006 per diluted share as of january 1 2002 related to our mail technologies business the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business in conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002 we recorded an additional impairment charge of 2 million related to our mail technologies business resulting in total goodwill impairment of 74 million for 2002 our annual impairment tests performed in 2003 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2004 our recorded goodwill was 1255 billion 

  

selfinsurance accruals —we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability health and welfare and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 

  

pension and postretirement medical benefits —the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial 

  

accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

  

financial instruments —as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations 

  

depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets —as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 140 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

  

in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 

  

when appropriate we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment factors that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 

  

in december 2003 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft as a result we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines 69 million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and 6 million of which impacted the international package segment 

  

in december 2004 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 747 and mcdonnell douglas dc8 aircraft as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines and parts 91 million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and 19 million of which impacted the international package segment 

  

these charges are classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow 

  

income taxes —we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and taking into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax 

  

purposes the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events the increasing profitability of our international segment increases the significance of our nonus income tax provision to our overall effective income tax rate we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carryforward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based in part on estimates of future taxable income a valuation allowance is established for the portion if any of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate in this regard we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “liquidity and capital resources” and other parts of this report contain “forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “we see” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements

   us domestic package revenue increased 1098 billion or 46 for the year which was driven by a 21 increase in average daily package volume and a 26 increase in revenue per piece ground volume increased by 15 in 2003 reversing a 20 decline in 2002 reflecting the improving us economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002 the volume for our ups next day air products increased by 67 during the year driven by doubledigit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during 2003 the increase in us domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 total us domestic average daily package volume increased 32 and 49 respectively   the overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in january 2003 with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below the decline in revenue per piece for the next day air products and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products 18   on january 6 2003 we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 39 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 005 to 115 over the commercial ground rate the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain zip codes increased 025 to 175 rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 34 and increased rates for deferred services by 45   rates for international shipments originating in the united states ups worldwide express ups worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased an average of 39 rate changes for shipments originating outside the united states generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market   during 2003 the indexbased fuel surcharge reset on a monthly basis and was based on the national us average onhighway diesel fuel prices as reported by the us department of energy based on published rates the average fuel surcharge increased to 147 in 2003 from 078 in 2002 resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of 144 million effective in 2004 we have discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service while a new indexed surcharge is being applied to our next day air and deferred products this new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel this change will have a negative impact on revenue for our ground products while having a beneficial impact on revenue for our next day air and deferred products   us domestic package operating profit declined 304 million or 85 primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses discussed further below under the section titled “operating expenses and operating margin” us domestic package operating profit increased 20 in the third quarter and decreased by 94 in the fourth quarter however in the fourth quarter of 2002 us domestic package operating profit benefited from a 175 million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees without the vacationrelated credit in the 2002 results fourth quarter operating profit would have increased 96 and the decline for the year ending december 31 2003 would have been 129 million or 38 

 

   us domestic package revenue decreased 73 million or 03 for the year this decrease was driven by a 19 decrease in average daily package volume and partially offset by a 16 increase in revenue per piece the decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors prior to the agreement reached on a new sixyear contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters combined with the continued weakness in the us economy the decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the july 31 2002 expiration date of the previous contract   on january 7 2002 we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 35 for commercial deliveries the ground residential charge increased 005 to 110 over the commercial ground rate and this charge also was applied to express deliveries in 2002 the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain zip codes remained at 150 and also was applied to express deliveries in 2002 rates for ups hundredweight increased 59   we also increased rates for ups next day air ups next day air saver ups 2nd day air and 3 day select an average of 40 the surcharge for ups next day air early am increased from 2750 to 2850 rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 39 rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout 2002 and varied by geographic market   an indexbased fuel surcharge which began in february 2002 and reset on a monthly basis replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 125 the indexed surcharge was based on the national us average onhighway diesel fuel prices as reported by the us department of energy based on published rates the average fuel surcharge for the year ended december 31 2002 was 078 approximately 251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge a decrease of 97 million from the prior year 19   us domestic package operating profit decreased 44 million or 12 for 2002 primarily due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses discussed further below in 2002 operating profit benefited from a credit to operating expense of 175 million that occurred related to a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees in 2001 we recorded a credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act which benefited the us domestic package segment by 28 million 

 

 

 

   international package revenue improved 881 million or 188 for the year due primarily to the 86 volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency revenue increased 443 million during the year due to currency fluctuations export volume increased throughout the world with asiapacific canada and the americas showing doubledigit export volume growth and us and european export volume increasing slightly over 6 european export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the euro and the weak european economy domestic volume increased 09 for the year which reverses a 32 decline from the previous year and was also negatively affected by the weak european economy   export revenue per piece increased 125 for the year 33 currencyadjusted due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management in total international average daily package volume increased 37 and average revenue per piece increased 174 62 currencyadjusted the 76 decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the americas   the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 387 million for the year 117 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations this increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously in 2002 international operating profit benefited from an 11 million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2002 international package revenue improved 435 million or 102 81 currencyadjusted due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements this volume growth was driven primarily by the asiapacific region which had an increase in average daily export volume of 171 and the europe region which had an increase in average daily export volume of 136 in total international average daily package volume increased 07 and average revenue per piece increased 91 68 currencyadjusted   the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 197 million for the year 22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations the increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 86 and a strong increase in revenue per piece in addition the shutdown of the us west coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results in 2002 operating profit benefited from an 11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy operating profit in 2002 benefited compared with 2001 from an 11 million reduction of expense due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2001 operating profit benefited from a 46 million credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 

 

 

 

   nonpackage revenue increased 234 million or 88 for the year ups supply chain solutions which comprises our former ups freight services and ups logistics group businesses increased revenue by 80 during the year this increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses with international revenues growing faster than in the us partially as a result of favorable 20 currency fluctuations favorable currency fluctuations accounted for 74 million of the increase in revenue freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at us west coast ports the remainder of our nonpackage operations which includes mail boxes etc the franchisor of mail boxes etc and the ups store ups capital corp our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business increased revenue by 110 for the year primarily due to increased franchise revenue at mail boxes etc and strong results from our mail innovations unit 

  nonpackage operating profit increased 266 million or 1343 for the year this increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our supply chain solutions unit which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program nonpackage operating profit in 2002 was reduced by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses and was increased by 11 million due to the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees nonpackage operating profit includes 114 million compared to 112 million in 2002 of intersegment profit with a corresponding amount of operating expense which reduces operating profit in the us domestic package segment   during 2003 we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by 14 million or 001 per diluted share the gain consisted of a pretax loss of 24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the nonpackage segment and a tax benefit of 38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale the tax benefit exceeds the pretax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes consequently our tax basis was greater than our book basis thus producing the tax benefit described above   also during 2003 we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pretax gain of 24 million 15 million aftertax or 001 per diluted share which is recorded in other operating expenses within the nonpackage segment the operating results of both the mail technologies unit and the aviation technologies unit were previously included in our nonpackage segment and were not material to nonpackage operating results in any of the periods presented 

 

   nonpackage revenue increased 589 million or 283 during 2002 204 of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 79 was due to organic growth   ups supply chain solutions revenue was up 490 million or 331 for the year much of which was due to having a full year of revenue from fritz companies inc which we acquired in may 2001 and other acquisitions revenue growth at supply chain solutions was hindered by the sale of the fedex brokerage business in march 2002 excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions ups supply chain solutions would have reported revenue growth of approximately 8 during 2002   nonpackage operating profit decreased by 19 million or 88 for the year in 2002 operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of 106 million primarily related to the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations and an 11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees operating profit in 2002 benefited compared with 2001 from a 61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization nonpackage operating profit includes 112 million in 2002 compared to 113 million in 2001 of intersegment profit with a corresponding amount of operating expense which reduces operating profit in the us domestic package segment 

 

 

 

   consolidated operating expenses increased by 1864 billion or 69 for the year 398 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and nonpackage segments compensation and 21 benefits increased by 1388 billion or 77 for the year primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense stockbased compensation expense totaled 724 million in 2003 a 140 increase over 2002 primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas 123 for 2003 stockbased compensation awards 

  other operating expenses increased by 476 million or 52 for the year largely due to a 123 increase in occupancy costs a 103 increase in fuel expense and smaller increases in purchased transportation repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization other operating expenses in 2002 were affected by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations into our ups supply chain solutions unit the growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities higher real estate taxes and weatherrelated increases in natural gas and utilities expense the fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003 somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and supply chain solutions businesses the growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft the completion of facilities projects including ups worldport and increased amortization of capitalized software the increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle aircraft and equipment maintenance expense   the increase in other expenses was due to a 75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of boeing 727 and dc8 aircraft from service of the total 75 million impairment charge 69 million impacted the us domestic package segment and 6 million impacted the international package segment   our operating margin defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 133 in 2003 from 131 in 2002 this increase is due to the growth in operating margin in our international package and nonpackage segments which benefited from the revenue increases described previously the operating margin for our three business segments was as follows    2002 adjusted operating margins exclude the effects of the vacation change which increased operating profit us domestic — 175 million 07 effect on operating margin international package — 11 million 03 and nonpackage — 11 million 04 and the effects of the restructuring charge which reduced nonpackage operating profit by 106 million and operating margin by 40 

 

   consolidated operating expenses increased by 817 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2002 compensation and benefits increased 543 million or 31 due primarily to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits in 2002 compensation and benefits were reduced by the 197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees   other operating expenses increased by 274 million or 31 for the year in 2002 other operating expenses were affected by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses in 2002 depreciation and amortization benefited from the absence of 72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2001 other operating expenses were reduced by 74 million for compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act   the nonpackage segment accounted for 513 million of the 817 million total increase in operating expenses this was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001 our 22 consolidated operating margin defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue remained at 131 during 2001 and 2002 

 

 

 

   the decrease in investment income of 45 million in 2003 is primarily due to a 58 million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003 we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost overall economic and market conditions and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer during the first quarter of 2003 after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets we recognized an impairment charge of 58 million primarily related to our investment in sp 500 equity portfolios   the 52 million decline in interest expense in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding lower interest rates on variable rate debt and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps 

 

   the decrease in investment income of 96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment in 2002 

 

 

 

   net income for 2003 was 2898 billion a decrease of 284 million from the 3182 billion achieved in 2002 resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from 281 in 2002 to 255 in 2003 net income in 2002 was favorably impacted by 776 million aftertax 068 per diluted share resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability and by 121 million aftertax 011 per diluted share from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees net income in 2002 was adversely impacted by 65 million aftertax 006 per diluted share due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by 72 million aftertax 006 per diluted share due to the fas 142 cumulative expense adjustment excluding the effect of the preceeding items net income for 2002 would have been 2422 billion or 214 per diluted share   net income in 2003 benefited from the 14 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of our mail technologies unit in the second quarter of 2003 the 15 million aftertax gain 001 per diluted share on the sale of our aviation technologies unit in the third quarter of 2003 and the 18 million aftertax gain 002 per diluted share due to the redemption of our 300 million cashsettled convertible senior notes in addition 2003 income tax expense was reduced by 55 million 005 per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the internal revenue service during the first quarter by 22 million 002 per diluted share due to a tax contingency accrual adjustment resulting from a favorable ruling on the tax treatment for jet engine maintenance costs during the third quarter and by 39 million 003 per share due to a lower effective state tax rate in the fourth quarter net income in 2003 was adversely affected by the 37 million aftertax 003 per diluted share investment impairment charge described previously excluding the effect of the preceeding items net income for 2003 would have been 2772 billion or 244 per diluted share this would represent a 140 increase in diluted earnings per share over the 214 achieved in 2002 after taking into account the items discussed previously 

 

   net income for 2002 was 3182 billion an increase of 783 million from 2399 billion in 2001 resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to 281 in 2002 from 210 in 2001 net income in 2001 was adversely impacted by the fas 133 cumulative expense adjustment of 26 million aftertax 002 per diluted share without which net income would have been 2425 billion or 212 per diluted share in 2002 our 23 results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of 65 million aftertax 006 per diluted share the fas 142 cumulative expense adjustment of 72 million aftertax 006 per diluted share the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees of 121 million aftertax 011 per diluted share and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of 776 million aftertax 068 per diluted share excluding the effect of the preceeding items net income for 2002 would have been 2422 billion or 214 per diluted share 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

   net cash provided by operating activities was 4646 5688 and 4570 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in 2003 operating cash flows from 2002 was primarily the result of the funding of 11 billion into our pension plans during 2003 as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements projected pension contributions in 2004 are approximately 426 million   in november 2003 we announced rate increases which took effect on january 5 2004 the overall impact is in line with previous years’ rate increases we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 19 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 025 to 140 over the commercial ground rate an additional delivery area surcharge of 100 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain zip codes rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 29 and increased rates for deferred services by 29 rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 35 rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market   in addition we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service while a new index is being applied to our next day air deferred products and international services this new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department’s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel the index for shipments originating in europe will be based on the rotterdam ara spot price of kerosenetype jet fuel 

 

   net cash used in investing activities was 1942 2194 and 3053 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the primary reason for these declines has been the slowing growth of our finance receivables portfolio and the lack of business acquisitions during 2002 and 2003 capital expenditures represent the primary use of cash in investing activities as follows in millions    we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 22 billion in 2004 these expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 24 

 

   net cash used in financing activities was 2180 2090 and 1493 billion in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repay longterm debt repurchase stock and pay dividends during 2003 we repaid over 12 billion in debt primarily consisting of 492 million of commercial paper 300 million in cashconvertible notes and 411 million in repayments of ups notes issuances of debt primarily consisted of ups notes we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and nonscheduled repayments of debt   in august 2003 a total of 10 billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program as of december 31 2003 858 million of this authorization was available for future share repurchases we repurchased a total of 398 million of common stock in 2003   we increased our cash dividends per share to 092 in 2003 from 076 in 2002 resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to 1026 billion from 840 million the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other relevant factors we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends in february 2004 the board of directors declared a 028 per share dividend which represents a 12 increase over the 025 previous quarterly dividend the dividend is payable on march 9 2004 to shareowners of record on february 23 2004

   on august 9 1999 the united states tax court tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd a bermuda company that had reinsured ev insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998 on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance under the terms of settlement we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately 562 million additions to tax of 60 million and related interest the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as a result we recorded income before taxes of 1023 billion 776 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2002 the refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years   the irs has proposed adjustments unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary the treatment of certain income and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years the proposed adjustments would result in 10 million of additional income tax the irs has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 42 million in additional income tax the irs’s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest we believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote in november 2002 the irs issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1995 through 1998 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 7 million in additional income tax for the 1985 through 1998 tax years unpaid interest on these adjustments through december 31 2003 could aggregate up to approximately 178 million after the benefit of related tax deductions we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues specifically we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2003 we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity   we are named as a defendant in twentythree pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for excess value “ev” insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 based on state and federal tort contract and statutory claims these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer we failed to provide promised ev insurance we acted 26 as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations and the price for ev insurance was excessive 

  these actions all were filed after the august 9 1999 united states tax court decision in which the tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd a bermuda company that had reinsured ev insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues relating to ev package insurance   these twentythree cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york in addition to the cases in which ups is named as a defendant there also is an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc centers this case also has been consolidated into the mdl proceeding   while expressly denying any and all liability the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding the proposed settlement requires several steps before it becomes final including notice to the settlement class and obtaining final court approval if the proposed settlement becomes final we would provide to qualifying settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees the total amount of which will be determined by the court the ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors we do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity   in addition we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity   we participate in a number of trusteemanaged multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements several factors could result in higher future contributions to these plans including unfavorable investment performance changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans   due to the events of september 11 2001 increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming however we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in addition our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions including selfinsuring certain risks to mitigate the expense increase   as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 228000 employees 64 of our total employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters “teamsters” these agreements run through july 31 2008 the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which became amendable january 1 2004 negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which becomes amendable on november 1 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers these agreements run through july 31 2009 market risk   we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do 27 not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps 

  the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled   a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline which are used in the transportation of packages additionally we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products primarily natural gas and electricity used in our operating facilities throughout the world we use a combination of options swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2003 and 2002 was an asset liability of 30 and 34 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 17 and 38 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

 

   we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound sterling we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures as of december 31 2003 and 2002 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of 48 and 3 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 97 and 42 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

 

   as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have various debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in shortterm primarily libor interest rates the potential change in annual 28 interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in shortterm interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december 31 2003 and 2002 would be approximately 25 and 28 million respectively 

  as described in note 1 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have certain investments in debt auction rate and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december 31 2003 and 2002 would be approximately 31 and 19 million respectively   additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest the potential change in annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december 31 2003 and 2002 would be immaterial   this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 

 

   we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2003 and 2002 the fair value of such investments was 95 and 322 million respectively the potential change in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 10 million at both december 31 2003 and 2002 

 

   the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default new accounting pronouncements   in june 2002 the fasb issued statement no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “fas 146” fas 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred this statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after january 1 2003   as discussed in note 17 we implemented a restructuring program involving the business unit integration of our freight services and logistics group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 as this restructuring program was initiated in 2002 we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in eitf 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” therefore the adoption of fas 146 on january 1 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of 106 million which is classified in other operating expenses   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor fin 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts the disclosure provisions of fin 45 were effective for financial statements ending after decem 29 ber 15 2002 while the recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the adoption of fin 45 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition 

  in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” to address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet in addition to numerous fasb staff positions written to clarify and improve the application of fin 46 the fasb recently announced a deferral for certain entities and an amendment to fin 46 entitled fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46”   fin 46 provides guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest resulting from arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting interests fin 46 defines the term “variable interest entity” and is based on the premise that if a business enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entity’s expected losses andor receives a majority of its expected residual returns that enterprise has a controlling financial interest and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest entity as of december 31 2003 we have adopted fin 46 and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of operations or financial condition   on july 1 2003 we adopted fasb statement no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “fas 149” fas 149 amends fas 133 for certain decisions made by the fasb as part of the derivatives implementation group process fas 149 also amends fas 133 to incorporate clarifications of the definition of a derivative the adoption of fas 149 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition   on july 1 2003 we adopted fasb statement no 150 “accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “fas 150” fas 150 establishes how an issuer measures certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities the adoption of fas 150 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition   in december 2003 the fasb revised statement no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” fas 132 the revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans as revised fas 132 is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 and we have included these disclosures in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity   contingencies  — as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result 30   goodwill impairment  — the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” in june 2001 as a result of the issuance of this new standard goodwill is no longer amortized but is subjected to annual impairment testing goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units upon adoption of fas 142 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 72 million 006 per diluted share as of january 1 2002 related to our mail technologies business the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business in conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002 we recorded an additional impairment charge of 2 million related to our mail technologies business resulting in total goodwill impairment of 74 million for 2002 our annual impairment test performed in 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2003 our recorded goodwill was 1173 billion   selfinsurance accruals  — we selfinsure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations   pension and postretirement medical benefits  — the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the impact of decreasing the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets to 896 and the decrease in the discount rate to 625 combined with other factors such as the additional fundings which occurred during 2003 will increase our pension plan expense by approximately 18 million in 2004   financial instruments  — as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations   depreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assets  — as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 139 billion of net fixed assets the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 31   in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program changes in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense   when appropriate we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment factors that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset   in december 2003 we permanently removed from service a number of boeing 727 and dc8 aircraft as a result we conducted an impairment evaluation which resulted in a 75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft this charge is classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses see note 13 ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow forwardlooking statements   “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “liquidity and capital resources” and other parts of this report contain ”forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements risk factors   the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forwardlooking statements  32

during 2002 we had approximately 360000 employees   we have received numerous awards and wide recognition as an employerofchoice including the following    as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 230000 employees 64 of our total employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters

are the largest package delivery company in the world in terms of both revenue and volume we offer a broad array of services in the package delivery industry and therefore compete with many different companies and services on a local regional national and international basis our competitors include the postal services of the united states and other nations various motor carriers express companies freight forwarders air couriers and others our major competitors include the united states postal service fedex airborne express dhl worldwide express deutsche post and tnt post group   we believe competition increasingly is based on a carrier’s ability to integrate its distribution and information systems with its customers’ systems to provide unique transportation solutions at competitive prices we rely on our vast infrastructure and service portfolio to attract and maintain customers as we expand our supply chain and other nonpackage businesses we compete with a number of participants in the supply chain financial services and information technology industries 7 government regulation   both the us department of transportation and the federal aviation administration regulate air transportation services   the dot’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation such as discriminatory pricing noncompetitive practices interlocking relations and cooperative agreements the dot also regulates subject to the authority of the president of the united states international routes fares rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad we are subject to us customs laws and related dot regulations regarding the import and export of shipments to and from the us in addition our customs brokerage entities are subject to those same laws and regulations as they relate to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters   the faa’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance personnel and ground facilities in 1988 the faa granted us an operating certificate which remains in effect so long as we meet the operational requirements of federal aviation regulations   the faa has issued rules mandating repairs on all boeing company and mcdonnelldouglas corporation aircraft that have completed a specified number of flights and also has issued rules requiring a corrosion control program for boeing company aircraft our total expenditures under these programs for 2002 were about 17 million the future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate all mandated repairs have been completed or are scheduled to be completed within the timeframes specified by the faa   in response to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on september 22 2001 president bush signed into law the air transportation safety and system stabilization act a 15 billion emergency economic assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the nation’s air carriers we submitted a claim for compensation to the dot and recognized a pretax amount of 74 million in 2001 related to this reimbursement as a credit to other operating expenses we may become subject to additional regulation by the faa or by other federal or state agencies as a result of increased security concerns in the aftermath of september 11   our ground transportation of packages in the us is subject to the dot’s jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of routes and to both the dot’s and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of safety insurance and hazardous materials   we are subject to similar regulation in many nonus jurisdictions in addition we are subject to nonus government regulation of aviation rights to and beyond nonus jurisdictions and nonus customs regulation   the postal reorganization act of 1970 created the us postal service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government and vested the power to recommend domestic postal rates in a regulatory body the postal rate commission we believe that the us postal service consistently attempts to set rates for its monopoly services particularly first class letter mail above the cost of providing those services in order to use the excess revenues to subsidize its expedited parcel international and other competitive services therefore we participate in the proceedings before the postal rate commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services   we are subject to numerous other laws and regulations in connection with our nonpackage businesses including customs regulations food and drug administration regulation of our transportation of pharmaceuticals and state and federal lending regulations   where you can find more information   we make our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports

 item 3 legal proceedings   on august 9 1999 the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd “opl” a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value “ev” package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years the court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes of 31 million on income reported by opl penalties and penalty interest of 93 million and interest for a total aftertax exposure estimated at approximately 246 million   the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 based on the tax court decision we estimated that our total aftertax exposure for tax years 1984 through 1999 could have been as high as 2353 billion   in our second quarter 1999 financial statements we recorded a tax assessment charge of 1786 billion which included an amount for related state tax liabilities the charge included taxes of 915 million and interest of 871 million this assessment resulted in a tax benefit of 344 million related to the interest component of the assessment as a result our net charge to net income for the tax assessment was 1442 billion increasing our total aftertax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to 1672 billion the tax benefit of deductible interest was included in income taxes in 1999 however since none of the income on which this tax assessment was based was our income we did not classify the tax charge as income taxes   we determined the size of our reserve with respect to these matters in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in 1999 we estimated our most likely liability 12 based on the initial tax court decision in making this determination we concluded that based on the tax court decision it was more likely that we would be required to pay taxes on income reported by opl and interest but that it was not probable that we would be required to pay any penalties and penalty interest in our prior estimation if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were determined to be payable we would have had to record an additional charge of up to 681 million 

  further as a result of the unfavorable tax court decision and in order to stop the potential accrual of additional interest that might ultimately have been determined to be due to the irs on august 31 1999 we paid 1349 billion and on august 8 2000 we paid an additional 91 million to the irs related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994 tax years we included the profit of the ev insurance program using the irs’s methodology for calculating these amounts for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we made with the irs in 1999 in february 2000 we paid 339 million to the irs related to these matters for the 1995 through 1997 tax years   on june 20 2001 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed the tax court’s decision on september 13 2001 the eleventh circuit denied the irs’s petition to have the appeal reheard en banc the irs did not attempt to appeal the case to the us supreme court and consequently the case was remanded to the tax court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties   in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance under the settlement of these issues we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately 562 million additions to tax of 60 million and related interest the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as described above as a result we recorded income before taxes of 1023 billion 776 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2002 the refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years   the ev program that was the subject of the tax court decision has been changed since september 1999 the revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by the tax court and the eleventh circuit related to opl   the irs has proposed adjustments unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary the treatment of certain income and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years the proposed adjustments would result in 10 million of additional income tax expense the irs has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 50 million in additional income tax expense in november 2002 the irs issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1995 through 1998 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 13 million in additional income tax expense for the 1985 through 1998 tax years unpaid interest on these adjustments through december 31 2002 could aggregate up to approximately 381 million after the benefit of related tax deductions we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues specifically we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2002 the irs’s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest we believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity   we are named as a defendant in 23 pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 based on state and federal tort contract and statutory claims these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer we failed to provide promised ev insurance we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations and the price for ev insurance was excessive 13   these actions all were filed after the august 9 1999 tax court decision as discussed above on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision   these 23 cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york the court has ruled on motions to dismiss granting our motions to dismiss with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ tort claims and all of their breach of contract claims prior to august 26 1994 claims asserted under specific federal statutes and breach of contract claims commencing on august 26 1994 may proceed at this time we intend to continue to seek dismissal of these remaining claims   the defendants in the mdl proceeding including ups have stipulated to conditional certification of a plaintiff class in most of the lawsuits challenging the ev insurance program for our shippers class certification is a procedural step that allows claims to be resolved at one time as to all potential claimants it does not depend on or reflect the merits of the underlying claims defendants may move later to set aside or modify the class certification   the cases subject to the class certification stipulation will proceed to a single trial before the federal court presiding over the mdl proceeding instead of being returned for trial to the numerous federal courts around the country from which they were transferred in addition plaintiffs in the five cases with pending motions to remand to state court have withdrawn these motions   in addition to the cases in which ups is named as a defendant there also is an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance purchased through mail boxes etc centers this case also has been consolidated into the mdl proceeding the plaintiff has moved to have the case remanded back to state court   we believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously the ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined   in addition we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion is intended to provide our investors with an understanding of our results of operations for the most recent years and our current financial condition this discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report operations   the following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue average daily package volume and average revenue per piece both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms  17  18 operating profit   the following tables set forth information showing the change in operating profit both in dollars in millions and in percentage terms   u s domestic package operations 2002 compared to 2001   us domestic package revenue decreased 73 million or 03 for the year this decrease was driven by a 19 decrease in average daily package volume and partially offset by a 16 increase in revenue per piece the decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors in connection with the agreement reached on a new sixyear contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters combined with the continued weakness in the us economy the decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the july 31 2002 expiration date of the existing contract   on january 7 2002 we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 35 for commercial deliveries the ground residential charge increased 005 to 110 over the commercial ground rate and this charge also was applied to express deliveries the additional delivery area surcharge which is added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible areas remained at 150 and also was applied to express deliveries rates for ups hundredweight increased 59   we also increased rates for ups next day air ups next day air saver ups 2nd day air and 3 day select an average of 40 the surcharge for ups next day air early am increased from 2750 to 2850 rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express ups worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased an average of 39 rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market   an indexbased fuel surcharge continued during 2002 the indexbased surcharge which resets on a monthly basis replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 125 which was originally implemented prior to 2001 the current surcharge is based on the national us average onhighway diesel fuel prices as reported by the us department of energy based on published rates the average fuel surcharge for the year ended december 31 2002 was 078 approximately 251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge a decrease of 97 million from the prior year   us domestic package operating profit decreased 44 million or 12 for the year ended december 31 2002 operating profit was affected by a nonrecurring benefit to operating expense of 175 million that occurred in 2002 related to a change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees excluding this item us domestic package operating profit decreased 219 million or 60 for the year due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses discussed further below in 2001 19 we recorded a credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act which benefited the us domestic package segment by 28 million 

2001 compared to 2000   us domestic package revenue was flat in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of a 10 decrease in average daily package volume offset by a 17 increase in average revenue per piece the decrease in volume resulted from the declining us economy during 2001 for the first quarter of 2001 average daily domestic volume was up 13 however average daily domestic volume was down 09 during the second quarter down 34 during the third quarter and down 08 during the fourth quarter the third quarter decline was largely a result of the events of september 11 also affecting the comparison were two extra operating days in 2000 compared to 2001   during the first quarter of 2001 we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 31 for commercial deliveries the ground residential charge increased 005 to 105 over the commercial ground rate and we increased rates for ups next day air ups next day air saver ups 2nd day air and 3 day select an average of 37 the surcharge for ups next day air early am increased from 2500 to 2750 rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express ups worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased by 29 rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout 2001 and varied by geographic market in addition all package rates during 2001 until december 10th included a 125 fuel surcharge effective december 10 2001 we implemented an indexbased surcharge which initially reduced the surcharge rate to 075 and resets on a monthly basis approximately 348 million in revenue was recorded in 2001 as a result of our fuel surcharge an increase of 218 million over the prior year   us domestic package operating profit decreased by 309 million due primarily to the decline in volume discussed previously this decrease was mitigated by cost control initiatives implemented during the year these initiatives focused on many of our semivariable costs and included curtailing nonunion hiring eliminating new consulting projects reevaluating all capital expenditures and information technology projects in process plus a variety of other items   international package operations   2002 compared to 2001   for the year ended december 31 2002 international package revenue improved 435 million or 102 81 currencyadjusted due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements this volume growth was driven primarily by the europe region which had an increase in average daily export volume of 136 and the asiapacific region which had an increase in average daily export volume of 171 in total international package average daily volume increased 07 and average revenue per piece increased 91 68 currencyadjusted   the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was 197 million for the year in 2002 operating profit benefited from an 11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy excluding the effect of this item operating profit increased by 186 million or 1488 for the year 22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations the increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 86 and a strong increase in revenue per piece in addition the shutdown of the us west coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results in 2002 this segment benefited by 11 million from the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2001 operating profit benefited from a 46 million credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act   2001 compared to 2000   the increase in international package revenue in 2001 was due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a 109 volume growth for our export products offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these 20 products the increase in cargo revenue resulted primarily from increased volume which was driven by the integration of our challenge air operations in latin america our europe region was a significant contributor to the export volume increase excluding the impact of currency fluctuations average revenue per piece increased 17 overall average daily package volume increased over 5 for international operations 

  the decline in the operating profit of our international package operations during 2001 resulted primarily from increased expenses particularly those expenses associated with aircraft used in this segment maintenance rental and fuel as we continued to add airlift capabilities to further expand our international presence we recorded 11 million of goodwill amortization in our international package segment in both 2001 and 2000   nonpackage operations   2002 compared to 2001   nonpackage revenue increased 589 million or 283 during 2002 204 of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 79 was organic   ups logistics group revenue was up 286 million or 388 for the year of which approximately half was due to acquisitions ups freight services revenue grew 204 million or 275 primarily due to having a full year of revenue from fritz companies inc which we acquired in may 2001 revenue growth at ups freight services was hindered by the sale of the fedex brokerage business in march 2002 adjusting for the effect of this sale freight services would have reported organic revenue growth of approximately 4 during 2002   nonpackage operating profit decreased by 19 million or 88 for the year operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of 106 million primarily related to the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations and an 11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy excluding the impact of these items nonpackage operating profit increased by 76 million or 350 in 2002 this segment benefited from a 61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization nonpackage operating profit includes 112 million compared to 113 million in 2001 of intersegment profit with a corresponding amount of operating expense which reduces operating profit in the us domestic package segment   2001 compared to 2000   the increase in nonpackage revenue in 2001 resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions particularly fritz which was included in our freight services unit nonpackage revenue also increased due to the continued growth of the ups logistics group the logistics group revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply chain management and service parts logistics offerings other nonpackage revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions first international bancorp and mail boxes etc offset by a decrease in thirdparty air operations revenue due to the discontinuation of our charter passenger services   the decrease in nonpackage operating profit was partially due to the 49 million gain we recognized from the sale of our ups truck leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of 2000 the remaining decrease was due to startup integration and operating costs for several subsidiaries that we were developing or acquired along with goodwill amortization expense associated with acquisitions during 2001 we recorded 61 million of goodwill amortization in our nonpackage segment which was an increase of 33 million over 2000 nonpackage operating profit included 113 million compared to 101 million in 2000 of intersegment profit   operating expenses and operating margin   2002 compared to 2001   consolidated operating expenses increased by 817 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2002 in 2002 operating expenses were affected by the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses in our nonpackage segment and the 197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy excluding the effect of these items operating expenses increased by 908 million or 34 for the year 21   excluding the 197 million credit to expense related to the change in vacation policy compensation and benefits increased by 744 million or 43 for the year primarily due to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits other operating expenses increased by 164 million or 18 excluding the 106 million restructuring charge and related expenses   the nonpackage segment accounted for 513 million of the 908 million total increase in operating expenses this was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001 in 2002 operating expenses benefited from the absence of 72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2001 other operating expenses were reduced by 74 million for compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act   adjusting for the effects of the restructuring charge and related expenses and vacation policy change our operating margin defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 131 during 2001 to 128 during 2002 this decline is primarily due to a 90 basis point decline in the operating margin for our us domestic package segment which experienced a volumedriven decline in profit   2001 compared to 2000   in 2001 operating expenses increased by 1373 billion or 55 with compensation and benefits up 851 million and other operating expenses up 522 million the 51 increase in compensation and benefits included a 101 million reduction in pension benefits expense depreciation and amortization and other occupancy expenses primarily rent and utilities accounted for over onehalf of the 62 increase in other operating expenses much of the increase in operating expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service offerings for our nonpackage segment excluding the nonpackage segment operating expenses increased by 25 over 2000 depreciation and amortization expense included 72 million of goodwill amortization a 33 million increase from 2000   our adjusted operating margin declined from 153 for 2000 to 131 for 2001 this decline continued the trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 as the economy began to weaken   investment incomeinterest expense   2002 compared to 2001   the decrease in investment income of 96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment   2001 compared to 2000   the decrease in investment income of 368 million for 2001 is due to two factors relating to 2000 first in the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a 241 million gain on investments held by our strategic enterprise fund in two companies that were acquired by other companies in addition we earned income on the 53 billion in net ipo proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that occurred in early march 2000 and the 12 billion in ipo proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer 22   net income and earnings per share   2002 compared to 2001   net income for 2002 was 3182 billion an increase of 783 million from 2399 billion in 2001 resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to 281 in 2002 from 210 in 2001 adjusting for the nonrecurring fas 133 cumulative expense adjustment net of tax of 26 million our net income in 2001 would have been 2425 billion or 212 per diluted share in 2002 our results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of 106 million the nonrecurring fas 142 cumulative expense adjustment of 72 million the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for nonunion employees of 197 million and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of 1023 billion excluding the impact of these nonrecurring items our 2002 net income would have been 2422 billion or 214 per diluted share compared to 212 in 2001   2001 compared to 2000   net income for 2001 amounted to 2399 billion or 210 per diluted share compared to 2934 billion or 250 per diluted share for 2000 our 2000 results reflected certain nonrecurring items which include the gains on our strategic enterprise fund investments and the sale of our truck leasing subsidiary offset partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new fulltime jobs from existing parttime teamster jobs our 2001 results reflect a fas 133 cumulative expense adjustment net of tax of 26 million excluding these nonrecurring transactions for each of these periods adjusted net income for 2001 would have been 2425 billion a decrease of 370 million from adjusted net income of 2795 billion for 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased from 238 in 2000 to 212 in 2001 liquidity and capital resources   our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations we maintain significant cash cash equivalents marketable securities and shortterm investments amounting to 3014 billion at december 31 2002   as part of our continuing share repurchase program 10 billion was authorized for share repurchases in february 2002 of which 705 million was still available as of december 31 2002   we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to 70 billion approximately 1036 billion was outstanding under these programs as of december 31 2002 all of which was classified as a current liability the average interest rate on the amount outstanding at december 31 2002 was 13 in addition we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 500 million no amounts were outstanding under this program at december 31 2002   we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of 125 billion each with one expiring on april 24 2003 and the other expiring on april 27 2005 interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90day libor plus 15 basis points there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december 31 2002   we also maintain a 10 billion european mediumterm note program under this program we may issue notes from time to time denominated in a variety of currencies at december 31 2002 10 billion was available under this program   we have a 20 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the us there was approximately 1552 billion issued under this shelf registration statement at december 31 2002 as of december 31 2002 910 million in notes have been issued under the ups notes program these notes have various terms and maturities all with fixed interest rates the notes are callable at various stated times after issuance and 345 million of the notes have been called since the inception of the program as of december 31 2002 565 million in ups notes were outstanding 23   on august 9 1999 the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd “opl” a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value “ev” package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984 and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years the court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes of 31 million on income reported by opl penalties and penalty interest of 93 million and interest for a total aftertax exposure estimated at approximately 246 million   the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 based on the tax court decision we estimated that our total aftertax exposure for tax years 1984 through 1999 could have been as high as 2353 billion   in our second quarter 1999 financial statements we recorded a tax assessment charge of 1786 billion which included an amount for related state tax liabilities the charge included taxes of 915 million and interest of 871 million this assessment resulted in a tax benefit of 344 million related to the interest component of the assessment as a result our net charge to net income for the tax assessment was 1442 billion increasing our total aftertax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to 1672 billion the tax benefit of deductible interest was included in income taxes in 1999 however since none of the income on which this tax assessment was based was our income we did not classify the tax charge as income taxes   we determined the size of our reserve with respect to these matters in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in 1999 we estimated our most likely liability based on the initial tax court decision in making this determination we concluded that based on the tax court decision it was more likely that we would be required to pay taxes on income reported by opl and interest but that it was not probable that we would be required to pay any penalties and penalty interest in our prior estimation if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were determined to be payable we would have had to record an additional charge of up to 681 million   further as a result of the unfavorable tax court decision and in order to stop the potential accrual of additional interest that might ultimately have been determined to be due to the irs on august 31 1999 we paid 1349 billion and on august 8 2000 paid an additional 91 million to the irs related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994 tax years we included the profit of the ev insurance program using the irs’s methodology for calculating these amounts for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we made with the irs in 1999 in february 2000 we paid 339 million to the irs related to these matters for the 1995 through 1997 tax years   on june 20 2001 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed the tax court’s decision on september 13 2001 the eleventh circuit denied the irs’s petition to have the appeal reheard en banc the irs did not appeal the case to the us supreme court and consequently the case was remanded to the tax court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties   in january 2003 we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance under the settlement of these issues we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately 562 million additions to tax of 60 million and related interest the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as described above as a result of the settlement we recorded income before taxes of 1023 billion 776 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2002 the refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years   the ev program that was the subject of the tax court decision has been changed since september 1999 the revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by the tax court and the eleventh circuit related to opl   the irs has proposed adjustments unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary the treatment of certain income and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years the proposed adjustments would result in 10 million of additional income tax expense the irs has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to 24 some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 50 million in additional income tax expense in november 2002 the irs issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1995 through 1998 that report proposes adjustments that would result in 13 million in additional income tax expense for the 1985 through 1998 tax years unpaid interest on these adjustments through december 31 2002 could aggregate up to approximately 381 million after the benefit of related tax deductions we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues specifically we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2002 the irs’s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest we believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  we are named as a defendant in 23 pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 based on state and federal tort contract and statutory claims these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer we failed to provide promised ev insurance we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations and the price for ev insurance was excessive   these actions were filed after the august 9 1999 tax court decision as discussed above on june 20 2001 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision   these 23 cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation proceeding “mdl proceeding” in federal court in new york the court has ruled on the motions to dismiss granting our motions with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ tort claims and all of their breach of contract claims prior to august 26 1994 claims asserted under specific federal statutes and breach of contract claims commencing on august 26 1994 may proceed at this time we intend to continue to seek dismissal of these remaining claims   the defendants in the mdl proceeding including ups have stipulated to conditional certification of a plaintiff class in most of the lawsuits challenging the ev insurance program for our shippers class certification is a procedural step that allows claims to be resolved at one time as to all potential claimants it does not depend on or reflect the merits of the underlying claims defendants may move later to set aside or modify the class certification   the cases subject to the class certification stipulation will proceed to a single trial before the federal court presiding over the mdl proceeding instead of being returned for trial to the numerous federal courts around the country from which they were transferred in addition plaintiffs in the five cases with pending motions to remand to state court have withdrawn these motions   in addition to the cases in which ups is named as a defendant there also is an action smith v mail boxes etc against mail boxes etc and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance purchased through mail boxes etc centers this case also has been consolidated into the mdl proceeding the plaintiff has moved to have the case remanded back to state court   we believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously the ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined   in addition we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity   due to the events of september 11 2001 increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming however we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in addition our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions including selfinsuring certain risks to mitigate the expense increase 25   as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 230000 employees 64 of our total employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters on october 7 2002 the teamsters ratified a new master agreement with ups that runs through july 31 2008 the new agreement is retroactive to august 1 2002 the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association which becomes amendable january 1 2004 our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727 which becomes amendable on november 1 2006 in addition the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers these agreements run through july 31 2009   in november 2002 we announced rate increases which took effect on january 6 2003 that are in line with previous rate increases we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 39 for commercial deliveries the ground residential surcharge increased 005 to 115 over the commercial ground rate the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain less accessible areas increased 025 to 175 rates for ups hundredweight increased 59 in addition we increased rates for ups next day air an average of 34 and increased rates for deferred services by 45 rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express ups worldwide express plus ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 39 rate changes for shipments originating outside the us generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market the indexbased fuel surcharge remains in effect and currently is 150   we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected longterm needs for the operation of our business including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases through 2009   following is a summary of capital expenditures in millions    we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 20 billion in 2003 these expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software   a discussion of our anticipated future payments under operating leases capital leases debt obligations and purchase commitments is provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements a discussion of our unfunded lending commitments is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements market risk   we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business as we do not engage in speculative trading activities in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we utilize a variety of foreign exchange interest rate equity and commodity forward contracts options and swaps   the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shifts in exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to 26 determine the impact of market shifts there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 

  a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels principally jeta diesel and unleaded gasoline which are used in the transportation of packages additionally we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products primarily natural gas and electricity used in our operating facilities throughout the world we use a combination of options swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk excluding the underlying exposures as of december 31 2002 and 2001 was an asset liability of 34 and 27 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 change in the underlying commodity price would be approximately 38 million at december 31 2002 this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

 

   we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currencydenominated assets liabilities and cash flows our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound sterling we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of approximately 3 and 4 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately 42 million at december 31 2002 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

 

   as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we have various debt instruments including debt associated with capital leases that are issued at fixed rates of interest such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates the fair value of our total longterm debt including current maturities at december 31 2002 and 2001 was 4926 and 5338 billion respectively the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 264 million at december 31 2002   we use a combination of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify and the notional amount interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december 31 2002 and 2001 was an asset liability of 62 and 74 million respectively the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 37 million at december 31 2002 27   as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have certain investments in securities that are purchased at fixed rates of interest at december 31 2002 and 2001 the fair value of our investments in debt securities was 481 and 691 million respectively the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 7 million at december 31 2002   additionally as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we hold certain finance receivables primarily commercial loans and finance leases at fixed rates of interest these assets are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates at december 31 2002 and 2001 the fair value of our investments in finance receivables was 1492 billion and 982 million respectively the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 5 million at december 31 2002   equity price risk   we hold investments in various equity securities that are subject to price risk and for certain of these securities we utilize options to hedge this price risk at december 31 2002 and 2001 the fair value of such investments was 322 and 382 million respectively the potential loss in the fair value of such investments assuming a 10 decline in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges would be approximately 10 million   credit risk   the forward contracts swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements however we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default future accounting changes   in june 2002 the fasb issued statement no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “fas 146” fas 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after january 1 2003   as discussed in note 17 we implemented a restructuring program involving the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 as this restructuring program was initiated in 2002 we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in eitf 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” therefore the adoption of fas 146 on january 1 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a pretax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of 106 million which is classified in other operating expenses   in 2003 we plan to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of fasb statement no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “fas 123” which is considered the preferable accounting method for stockbased employee compensation under fas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” we have elected to adopt the measurement provisions of fas 123 using the prospective method under this approach all future employee stock option grants and other stockbased compensation will be expensed to compensation and benefits over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stockbased compensation is granted we will continue to provide pro forma income and earnings per share information related to prior awards the expensing of stockbased compensation is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately 002 in 2003 by 2006 we expect to realize the full impact of adopting fas 123 and estimate that diluted earnings per share will be reduced by approximately 008 in that year 28   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor fin 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts the disclosure provisions of fin 45 are effective for financial statements ending after december 15 2002 while the recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 we are currently evaluating the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 on our financial statements   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 provides guidance on the identification of variable interest entities and the assessment of a company’s interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether consolidation is appropriate fin 46 requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved fin 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and is effective for periods beginning after june 15 2003 for existing variable interest entities as we have no material exposures to special purpose entities or other offbalance sheet arrangements we anticipate that the effects of adopting fin 46 will not be material to our results of operations or financial condition critical accounting policies and estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity contingencies   as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” fas 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate a future charge to income would result likewise if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate a future credit to income would result goodwill impairment   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” in june 2001 as a result of the issuance of this new standard goodwill is no longer amortized but is subjected to annual impairment testing goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units upon adoption of fas 142 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 72 million 006 per diluted share as of january 1 2002 related to our mail technologies business the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business as of december 31 2002 our recorded goodwill was 1070 billion 29 selfinsurance accruals   we selfinsure estimated costs associated with workers’ compensation claims automotive liability and general business liabilities up to certain limits insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported the recorded levels of these reserves are determined by outside actuaries who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate however actual experience in claim frequency andor severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations pension and postretirement medical benefits   the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets mortality rates and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and information as to historical experience and performance differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the impact of decreasing the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets to 921 and the decrease in the discount rate to 675 combined with other factors will increase our pension plan expense by approximately 135 million in 2003 financial instruments   as discussed in notes 2 3 8 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements and in the “market risk” section of this report we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value fair values are based on listed market prices when such prices are available to the extent that listed market prices are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including dealer price quotations certain financial instruments including overthecounter derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that consider among other factors contractual and market prices correlations time value credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors changes in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future potentially affecting our results of operations forwardlooking statements   “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “liquidity and capital resources” and other parts of this report contain “forwardlooking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict these statements include statements regarding our intent belief and current expectations about our strategic direction prospects and future results we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements risk factors   the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forwardlooking statements  30
