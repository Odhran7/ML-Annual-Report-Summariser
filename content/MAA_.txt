business objectives 

our primary business objectives are to generate a sustainable stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

• create value for our shareholders residents associates and the communities in which our properties are located 

• effectively operate our existing properties with an intense property and asset management focus 

• utilize technology to provide services desired by our residents and create efficiencies and performance advantages in our operations 

• take an opportunistic approach to buying selling developing and renovating apartment communities 

• diversify our portfolio across markets submarkets and price points in the geographical areas in which we operate to minimize operating performance volatility 

• offer attractive work environments compensation and incentive packages and career development opportunities to attract and retain required talent and 

• actively manage our balance sheet and capital structure 

operations 

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the income producing capacity of each apartment community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

• providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations 

• implementing programs to control expenses through investment in costsaving initiatives 

• analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas 

• maintaining the physical condition of each property through ongoing capital investments 

• improving the “curb appeal” amenities and common areas of the apartment communities through environmentallythoughtful landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning apartment communities from time to time to enhance or maintain market positions 

• effectively utilizing search engine optimization internet leasing solutions and other internet tools to generate leasing traffic 

• managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing and 

• allocating additional capital including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements 

we believe that leveraging the strength of enterprise solutions in conjunction with our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge and provides greater accountability than an entirely centralized structure to support our operational structure senior management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and optimizing property operations and reviewing property management performance through extensive reporting processes and onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior management and the properties on a realtime basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies and continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

investment in technology continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and helps us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications leases and renewals through our webbased resident portal interacting with our residents through such technology has allowed us to improve resident satisfaction ratings and increase the efficiency of our operating teams during 2021 our resident portal also provided a safer way to transact business during the covid19 pandemic and we have continued to invest in technology to enable potential residents to examine their future homes both online virtual touring or by selfguided tour selftouring in addition to the more traditional guided tour 

acquisitions and development 

our external growth strategy is to acquire existing apartment communities utilize our internal development team to develop our own apartment communities and partner with local developers to develop apartment communities that we will own completely after stabilization which we refer to as a prepurchase transaction acquisitions and development along with dispositions help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and asset allocation portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing management and overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition and development 

  

of apartment communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and we will utilize this strategy to increase our number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

we acquired the following properties during the year ended december 31 2021 

 1 represents number of units upon completion of the development 

2 this prepurchase multifamily community development is being developed through a joint venture with a local developer we own 80 of the joint venture that owns this property 

 development activities may be conducted through entities we whollyown or through joint ventures with our prepurchase transaction partners typically fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer during the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred 2316 million in development costs and completed four development projects 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2021 dollars in thousands 

 1 this prepurchase multifamily community development is being developed through a joint venture with a local developer we own 80 of the joint venture that owns this property 

dispositions 

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional equity or debt capital in deciding to sell an apartment community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual properties considering the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2021 we disposed of seven multifamily communities totaling 1905 units and five land parcels totaling approximately 142 acres 

property redevelopment and repositioning activity 

we focus on both interior unit upgrades and property amenity and common area upgrades above and beyond routine capital upkeep on our apartment communities that we believe have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2021 we renovated the kitchen and bathroom of 6360 apartment units at an average cost of 5893 per apartment unit achieving average rental rate increases of 122 above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated apartment units 

we have installed smart home technology unit entry locks mobile control of lights and thermostat and leak monitoring at select apartment communitie s in order to provide additional resident value and increase rent growth during the year ended december 31 2021 we installed smart devices in 23579 apartment units at an average cost of 1395 per apartment unit and a projected average monthly rent increase of approximately 25 per unit upon lease renewal or unit turnover as of december 31 2021  we have completed installation of the smart home technology at nearly onehalf of our existing properties and are employing smart home technology in all of our new developments 

separately we continued our property repositioning program to upgrade and reposition the amenity and common areas at select apartment communities the program includes targeted plans to move all apartment units at the properties to higher rents for the year ended december 31 2021 we spent 92 million on this program 

  

portfolio strategy 

our goal is to maintain a diversified balanced portfolio that we believe provides the optimal path to maximizing operating performance over the full economic cycle maintaining a diverse portfolio includes 

• operating apartment communities in a variety of markets across the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states 

• operating apartment communities in a variety of submarkets within our markets urban suburban inner loop etc 

• operating apartment communities of different product types such as highrise midrise and garden style 

• offering a variety of different rent price points within a market or submarket 

we believe a diverse portfolio performs well during economic up cycles and weathers economic down cycles better than a more homogenous portfolio 

human capital 

as of december 31 2021 we employed 2429 associates our associates’ time energy creativity and passion are essential to our continued success as a company with respect to our workforce we focus on driving diversity and inclusion providing marketcompetitive pay and benefits to support our associates’ wellbeing encouraging our associates’ growth and development fostering associate engagement and protecting our associates’ health and safety 

we respect the privilege of providing value to those whose lives we touch we call this outlook our “brighter view” to achieve these objectives we use our core values to guide the way we interact with each other and conduct business by 

• appreciating the uniqueness of each individual 

• communicating openly and with integrity 

• embracing opportunities and 

• doing the right thing at the right time for the right reasons 

diversity equity and inclusion 

we strive to recruit develop and retain a talented and diverse workforce that mirrors the diversity of our residents and the communities where we do business we are committed to an inclusive working environment that not only values diversity in ideas and opinions but also fosters a sense of belonging and connection where associates feel recognized and appreciated regardless of individual differences our goal through these efforts is to support and promote inclusive diversity equal opportunity and fair treatment for all those working at the company and as a result create more value for all the constituents we serve our inclusive diversity council is comprised of individuals across all areas of our company whose aim is to cultivate conversations expand education and examine our practices surrounding diversity and inclusion this group works collaboratively with our chief executive officer and other members of our executive team to ensure our policies and actions are guided by our culture of inclusivity and are free from discriminatory practices and bias 

we recruit from a diverse range of sources including historically black colleges and universities as well as technicaltrade schools as of december 31 2021 ethniccultural minorities represented approximately 49 of our workforce 37 of our collective corporate regional and property leadership positions and 52 of our associates promoted during the year ended december 31 2021 also as of december 31 2021 females represented approximately 46 of our workforce 55 of our collective corporate regional and property leadership positions and 57 of our associates promoted during the year ended december 31 2021 representing a 1 increase from the year ended december 31 2020 we intend to continue using a combination of targeted recruiting talent development and internal promotion strategies to expand the diversity of our employee base across all roles and functions 

wellbeing and development 

we take a comprehensive approach to supporting our associates’ physical and emotional health as well as their financial and professional wellbeing our associates are eligible for medical dental and vision insurance life and disability insurance various wellness programs an employee assistance program for which we pay part or all the cost as well as other benefits we strive to maintain an equitable compensation program for performance designed to reward competitive levels of compensation based on employee contributions performance and qualifications we offer a 401k savings plan with an employer match as well as educational support for savings strategies we also offer discounted rent to associates parental leave and financial assistance with adoption expenses as well as grant up to three scholarships for associates’ dependents each year our training and development programs are designed to provide continuous learning for associates in the flow of their workday additionally we encourage and provide financial assistance to our eligible associates to seek education and certification outside of the company through both apartment associations and accredited educational institutions we encourage our associates to “embrace opportunities” including developing skills and knowledge needed for increased responsibilities as they promote within the company 

  

communication and engagement 

it is our goal to communicate authentically with our associates in a way that is clear credible and compassionate we understand effective communication must flow both ways and we strive to continuously improve our efforts to appropriately engage our associates so that as a team we can successfully complete our mission our internal communications function aims to provide associates the information they need in a timely focused relevant and consistent manner using the most appropriate channels available it is also important that we maintain an active dialogue with our associates and they have multiple channels to be seen and heard we periodically conduct a comprehensive survey to measure associate engagement and pulse checks to capture topical feedback to guide current programs projects and progress we also conduct an annual review process to provide an opportunity for each associate to build mutual understanding with leadership gain selfdiscovery and learn about possible avenues for growth we encourage a work environment where ideas problems and solutions can be discussed with immediate managers and other management personnel associates may also use our company intranet as a means of submitting feedback 

health and safety 

since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we have been committed to protecting our associates residents and guests while balancing the needs of the business in 2021 we continued to follow our covid19 workplace health and safety guidelines and made amendments as needed to respond to us centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and directives from state and local governmental authorities we also continued to offer several measures to support our associates’ overall wellbeing including supplemental leave and sick time policies additional covid19 paid time off and coverage for covid19 testing and vaccination under our health plan following us federal food and drug administration approvals of covid19 vaccines and later the booster shots we encouraged but did not require our associates to take advantage of available vaccines and offered financial incentives for associates who got vaccinated and boosted against covid19 the combination of all of these measures have allowed us to maintain our onsite workforce during 2021 which we believe has alleviated disruption to our operations and the challenge of reintegrating a longterm remote workforce back to traditional prepandemic working conditions 

capital structure 

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives we focus on maintaining access flexibility and low costs which we believe allows us to proactively support normal business operations and source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturities to avoid disproportionate exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

as of december 31 2021 142 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings including 131 under unsecured borrowings and 11 under secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 30 to 36 of our adjusted total assets as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by maalp our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our total debt to 60 or less of our adjusted total assets as of december 31 2021 our total debt was approximately 298 of our adjusted total assets we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flow from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments 

competition and market demand 

our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing apartment communities offer features that our apartment communities do not have or may be deemed to be in a more desirable location within the market competing apartment communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing apartment communities are newer than our apartment communities may have different amenities or otherwise be more attractive to a prospective resident the competitive position of each apartment community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate 

  

investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources greater ability to utilize leverage or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and acquisition and development opportunities we believe our competitive advantages include 

• a fully integrated organization with property management development redevelopment acquisition marketing sales and financing expertise 

• scalable operating and support systems which include automated systems to meet the changing technological needs of our residents and associates 

• access to a wide variety of debt and equity capital sources 

• geographic diversification with a prese nce in 36 defined markets acr oss the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states and 

• significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert and offer varying location options within a market to meet a variety of prospective resident preferences 

moving forward we plan to continue our focus on optimizing lease expiration management current and prospective resident engagement expense control and resident retention efforts and also to align employee incentive plans with our performance we also plan to continue to make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis to maintain a competitive position we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational growth 

for information regarding trends in market demand see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental matters 

as a part of our standard apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see “risk factors – environmental problems are possible and can be costly” and “risk factors – compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations and the values of our properties” in this annual report on form 10k 

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

government regulations 

we must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with the laws and regulations of the united states as well as state and local laws and regulations in the markets where our properties are located which may differ among jurisdictions in response to the covid19 pandemic federal governmental authorities as well as state and local governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our properties are located implemented laws and regulations which impacted our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course including our ability to charge certain fees increase rents and evict residents who violate their lease these governmental requirements along with the covid19 pandemic had an impact on our operations in the year ended december 31 2021 and any reinstatement of similar requirements in response to the pandemic could effect our results of operations for the year ending december 31 2022 otherwise we do not expect that compliance with the various laws and regulations we are subject to will have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position for the year ending december 31 2022 as compared to prior periods

 item 1a ris k factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that are not presently known to us that we currently believe are immaterial or that could apply generically to any company may also significantly impact our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could suffer the market price of our stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our stock or debt securities 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

the covid19 pandemic has materially impacted and may continue to materially impact our business and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by factors relating to the pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic and the president of the united states proclaimed that the covid19 outbreak in the united states constituted a national emergency extraordinary actions were taken by federal state and local governmental authorities to combat the spread of covid19 including issuance of “stayathome” directives and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations while many of the restrictions have eased across the country the pandemic has not yet been contained in the united states and some areas have reimposed closures and other restrictions due to increased rates of covid19 cases no assurance can be given that these new closures and restrictions will not continue to occur the emergence of new and more easily transmitted variants of covid19 such as the delta and omicron variants have resulted in a longerterm impact of the restrictions employed to control the covid19 pandemic which have combined to produce significant effects on the job market supplychain and materials pricing in addition there have been and may continue to be downstream effects of widespread longterm remote working conditions academic and childcare disruption and various financial aid measures employed by government sectors it is unknown which of these effects will be temporary which will have a longterm impact and what negative impacts or risks may result 

our ability to lease our apartments and collect rental revenues is dependent upon national regional and local economic conditions particularly unemployment levels and personal income levels as unemployment rises and incomes fall fewer people including both current and prospective residents may be able to afford our apartment communities and it may be difficult for some of our residents to make timely rental payments to us under their leases 

  

the persistence of the covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread could have significant adverse impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows that are difficult to predict such adverse impacts will depend on among other factors 

• our residents’ ability or willingness to pay rent in full on a timely basis 

• federal state local and industryinitiated efforts that may adversely affect the ability of landlords including us to collect rent and customary fees adjust rental rates and enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent such as the various orders that were issued by governmental authorities and public officials to temporarily halt residential evictions to prevent further spread of covid19 

• the legacy of the regulatory focus on landlords during the pandemic as distinguished from other providers of essential services 

• our ability to renew leases or relet units on favorable terms or at all including as a result of unfavorable economic and market conditions in those markets where our apartment communities are located 

• our ability to lease or relet units due to social distancing or other restrictions that may frustrate our leasing activities 

• our ability to successfully complete the leaseup of properties in our leaseup portfolio and attain expected rental and occupancy rates due to social distancing or other restrictions that may frustrate our leasing activities 

• our ability to continue our apartment unit redevelopment programs and attain increased rental rates for renovated or upgraded units due to social distancing or other restrictions 

• our ability to complete the construction of properties in our development portfolio on schedule and on budget due to social distancing or other restrictions labor shortages supply chain disruptions and escalating labor and material costs 

• the impact of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures on our normal business operations including repair and maintenance work and unit renovations and upgrades 

• severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the financial markets including the debt and equity capital markets which have already experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions or a refusal or failure of one or more lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund their respective financing commitment to us which may affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our business operations or refinance maturing debt on a timely basis on attractive terms or at all which would adversely affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 

• sustained stock market volatility that negatively affects the market price of our securities including market conditions unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

• the impact on our workforce of any vaccine mandate implemented by governmental authorities which could result in employee attrition and 

• our ability to manage our business to the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the covid19 pandemic and are not willing available or allowed to conduct work 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the current economic financial and capital markets environment present material risks and uncertainties for us the extent of the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows will depend largely on future developments relating to the duration and scope of the covid19 pandemic in the united states including the continued emergence persistence severity and transmissibility of variants of the virus the efficacy of vaccines the pace at which governmental restrictions are eased or lifted and the implementation of new or additional mitigation efforts by governmental authorities to control the spread of the disease such as “stayathome” orders business closures and vaccine mandates to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k in addition if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease or similar public health crisis we would be subject to similar risks as posed by the covid19 pandemic 

  

unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our properties 

unfavorable market and economic conditions in the areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our apartment communities at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility inflationary conditions and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to make distributions which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our apartment communities include the following among others 

• downturns in global national regional and local economic conditions particularly increases in unemployment 

• declines in mortgage interest rates and home pricing making alternative housing more affordable 

• government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership making alternative housing options more attractive 

• local real estate market conditions including oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area 

• declines in the financial condition of our residents which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some residents 

• declines in market rental rates 

• declines in household formation and 

• increases in operating costs if these costs cannot be passed through to our residents 

failure to generate sufficient cash flow could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

• weakness in the general economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing 

• competition from other apartment communities 

• overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments or alternative housing options ie condominiums or singlefamily houses for rent or sale in our markets which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates andor require rent concessions in order to lease apartments 

• increases in operating costs including real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset by increased rental rates 

• inability to initially or subsequently after lease terminations rent apartments on favorable economic terms 

• changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance 

• the enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws in the areas in which we operate or other laws regulating multifamily housing 

• other changes in laws including but not limited to tax laws and housing laws 

• an uninsured loss including those resulting from a catastrophic storm earthquake or act of terrorism 

• changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing borrower credit standards and downpayment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available or increase our acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available and 

• the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

  

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors 

as of december 31 2021 substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 405 of our portfolio was located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas orlando florida and charlotte north carolina in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of our portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and acquisition and development opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and acquisition and development opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues and 2 acquisition and development opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay higher prices for new properties than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing desired properties at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance 

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions and local economies to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such apartment communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

  

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal 

• all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities 

• that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us 

• that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such apartment communities or 

• that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our apartment communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

our business and operations are subject to physical and transition risks related to climate change 

many of our apartment communities are located along or near coastal areas to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns areas where many of our communities are located could experience more frequent and intense extreme weather events and rising sea levels which may cause significant damage to our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our residents over time such conditions could result in reduced demand for housing in areas where our communities are located and increased costs related to further developing our communities to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance likewise such conditions also may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance we are able to procure 

changes in federal state and local laws and regulations on climate change could result in increased operating costs andor capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in rental revenues for example various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions among other things “green” building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design construction materials water and energy usage and efficiency and waste management the imposition of such requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing communities for example by requiring retrofits of existing communities to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather and developing new communities without creating corresponding increases in rental revenues which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 

operations from new acquisitions development projects and redevelopment activities may fail to perform as expected 

we intend to acquire develop and redevelop apartment communities as part of our business strategy newly acquired developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect we may also overestimate the revenue or underestimate the expenses that a new or repositioned property may generate the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may fail to meet our expectations underlying our investment 

in addition with respect to acquisitions we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations and the failure to successfully integrate those apartment communities or personnel would result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments likewise we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition state of title physical condition or compliance with zoning laws building codes or other legal requirements and in each case our acquisition may be without any or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results 

  

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we plan to sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy however adverse market conditions could limit our ability to sell properties when we want and to change our portfolio promptly to meet our strategic objectives likewise federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of properties and this limitation could prevent us from selling properties when market conditions are favorable from time to time we may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2021 we had six development communities under construction representing 2021 units once complete we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

• we may be unable to obtain or face delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations which could result in increased development costs could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations 

• we may be unable to obtain financing for development activities under favorable terms which could cause a delay in construction resulting in increased costs decreases in revenue and potentially cause us to abandon the opportunity 

• yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects costs that exceed budget higher than expected concessions for leaseup and lower rents than initially estimated 

• bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

• we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities 

• we may be unable to complete construction and leaseup of an apartment community on schedule or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs 

• occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed apartment community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community 

• when we sell to third parties apartment communities or properties that we developed or renovated we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance 

• our failure to successfully enter into a joint venture agreement may prohibit an otherwise advantageous investment if we cannot raise the money through other means and 

• adoption of laws and regulations designed to address climate change and its effects including for example “green” building codes could increase our costs of development and cause delays in the construction of our development communities 

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control for example the potential impact of climate change and the increased risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters could cause a significant increase in our insurance premiums and adversely affect the availability of coverage if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation as our leases allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal which may enable us to seek rent increases however since our leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

we rely on information technology systems in our operations and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we rely on proprietary and thirdparty information technology systems to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes we store and maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with whom we do business on our information technology systems we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment in addition we engage thirdparty service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us including web hosting property management leasing accounting payroll and benefit services the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us we take steps and generally require thirdparty service providers to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers’ information technology systems including the use of systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information however we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or misconduct this risk of a data breach or security failure particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions 

the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers’ systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed to not be detected and in fact may not be detected in addition thirdparty information technology providers may not provide us with fixes or updates to hardware or software in a manner as to avoid an unauthorized loss or disclosure or to address a known vulnerability which may subject us to known threats or downtime as a result of those delays accordingly we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures further we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and internal processes and procedures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers’ information technology systems and the information stored by us or our service providers including personally identifiable information of residents prospective residents and employees could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen any failure to prevent a data breach or a security failure of our or our service providers’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations result in downtime divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations similarly if our service providers fail to use adequate security or data protection processes or use personal data in an unpermitted or improper manner we may be liable for certain losses and it may damage our reputation 

compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations and the values of our properties 

we must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations for example the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

we do not know whether the legal requirements we are subject to will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in laws and regulations could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures and limit our ability to recover increases in operating expenses impose limitations on our ability to increase rents or charge certain fees impose limitations on our ability to enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent or otherwise adversely impact our operations for example as the eviction moratoria enacted in light of the covid19 pandemic began to lapse in 2021 many state and local governments implemented policies to prevent or delay formal eviction proceedings likewise the federal government has urged all states to adopt eviction diversion strategies including among others a requirement for landlords to apply for rental assistance prior to filing for eviction and the extension of pending eviction cases to provide sufficient time for rental assistance applications to be processed while also 

  

recommending creation of more robust eviction diversion programs over the longer term that include a combination of rental assistance mandatory alternative dispute resolution and access to legal counsel for unrepresented tenants in addition we have seen an increase in state and local governments implementing considering or being urged by tenant advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as tenants’ rights laws and regulations any such future enactments in the markets in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties 

legal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business 

as an owner operator and developer of multifamily apartment communities we may become involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to commercial development employment environmental securities shareholder tenant or tort legal issues some of which could result in a class action lawsuit for example as described in more detail in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are currently a defendant in two putative class action lawsuits relating to tenant late fee policies at our texas apartment communities 

legal proceedings if decided adversely to or settled by us and not covered by insurance could result in liability material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows likewise regardless of outcome legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject 

extreme weather or natural disasters may cause significant damage to our properties and losses from catastrophes could exceed our insurance coverage 

many of our apartment communities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters such as floods tornados hurricanes and earthquakes the likelihood or frequency of which events could increase in part based on the impact of climate change such events may cause significant damage to our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our residents there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business 

we carry property insurance on our apartment communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods tornados hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and therefore may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining what we believe is appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties 

acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our apartment communities could directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings or other acts of violence the occurrence of which could impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as result in operational losses due to reduced rental demand and the availability of insurance may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our apartment communities we may also become subject to significant liability claims in addition the adverse effects that actual or threatened terrorist attacks could have on national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 the amount of our total debt was 45 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 

• debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution and funds available for acquisitions development and redevelopment 

• we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt 

• we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

• we may default on our indebtedness which could result in acceleration of those obligations assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure and 

• if one of our subsidiaries defaults it could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration provision under other indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or could allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

if any one of these events was to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms if at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on our variablerate debt or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixedrate debt which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock any increase in the federal funds rate due to key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the phaseout of libor could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

libor is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility although we had no borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 the ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor ceased the publication of oneweek and twomonth us dollar usd libor as of december 31 2021 and plans to cease the publications of the remaining tenors of usd libor one three six and 12month immediately after june 30 2023 the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has endorsed replacing usd libor with the secured overnight financing rate or sofr sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities however us banking regulators have indicated that financial institutions will be permitted to choose any benchmark rate to replace libor the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility allow for the transition to an alternate benchmark interest rate including sofr to replace any outstanding usd libor borrowings when usd libor is no longer published given the inherent differences 

  

between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and will span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings including our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of apartment communities which no longer meet our investment criteria in addition we may fund other of our capital requirements through additional debt our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may incur more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding borrowings of 45 billion our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others and cross default provisions with other material debt our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of unsecured debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 

we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets which could result in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing likewise disruptions could impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again becomes limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

  

risks related to maa’s organization and ownership of its stock 

maa’s ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

maa’s charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

• will consider the transfer to be null and void 

• will not reflect the transaction on its books 

• may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction 

• will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares 

• will not recognize any voting rights for those shares 

• will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit and 

• will either direct the holder to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa or maa will redeem the shares if maa redeems the shares the holder will be paid a price equal to the lesser of 

o the principal price paid for the shares by the holder 

o a price per share equal to the market price as determined in the manner set forth in its charter of the applicable capital stock 

o the market price as so determined on the date such holder would but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares and 

o the maximum price allowed under the tennessee greenmail act such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement 

the redemption price may be paid at maa’s option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

• the holder may lose its power to dispose of the shares 

• the holder may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases and 

• the holder may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases 

future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to maa’s stock may adversely affect the market price of maa’s stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to maa’s common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of maa’s common stock and may result in dilution to owners of maa’s common stock we and indirectly maa’s shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future offerings thus holders of maa’s common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of maa’s common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

  

provisions of maa’s charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maa’s charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 868000 of which have been designated as 850 series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2021 867846 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maa’s acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

thirdparty expectations relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

we have a significant institutional investor base and there is an increasing focus from institutional investors and other stakeholders on corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance or esg factors some institutional investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and many institutional investors focus on positive esg business practices and may consider a company’s esg score when making an investment decision in addition many institutional investors may use esg scores to benchmark companies against their peers thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards in addition the criteria by which companies’ esg practices are assessed are evolving which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy any new criteria alternatively if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific thirdparty provider some investors may conclude that our esg business practices are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility standards do not meet the standards set by various stakeholders in addition in the event that we communicate certain esg initiatives and goals we could fail or be perceived to have failed in our achievement of our initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the esg expectations of investors and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results and the market price of maa’s common stock could be adversely affected 

market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa’s common stock 

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maa’s common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maa’s borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maa’s common stock to go down 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa’s common stock 

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maa’s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa’s common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa’s shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa’s common stock 

  

the stock markets including the nyse on which maa lists its common stock have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maa’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maa’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of maa’s publicly traded securities may be affected by many factors including but not limited to the following 

• our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies 

• actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results 

• changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts 

• publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts 

• additions and departures of key personnel

risks related to the operating partnership’s organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnership’s existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnership’s sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa’s ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnership’s unitholders must approve the operating partnership’s sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership’s unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership’s affairs 

maa as the operating partnership’s sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnership’s affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the unitholders of the operating partnership also maa owns approximately 973 of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership’s unitholders for approval 

  

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa’s common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make payments on its debt and to make distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to make distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment to make payments on its debt or to make distributions to its unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of maa’s common stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trs and those trs will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits 

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if any reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

in the past we have acquired companies that operated in a manner intended to allow them to qualify as reits for us federal income tax purposes if any such reit previously acquired by maa referred to as a merged reit is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including 

• maa would be required to pay us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the taxable income of such merged reit without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable years that the merged reit did not qualify as a reit and for which the statute of limitations period remains open and 

• maa would be required to pay any federal alternative minimum tax liability of the merged reit and any applicable state and local tax liability in each case for all taxable years that remain open under the applicable statute of limitations periods 

maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to five years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in 

  

addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were “investment companies” under the “investment company” rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s business prospects financial condition or results of operations and on maa’s ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above 

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition 

any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions 

legislative or regulatory income tax changes related to reits could materially and adversely affect us 

the us federal income tax laws and regulations governing reits and their shareholders as well as the administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations are constantly under review and may be changed at any time possibly with retroactive effect no assurance can be given as to whether when or in what form changes to the us federal income tax laws applicable to us and maa’s shareholders may be enacted changes to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations of us federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in maa’s stock

maa an sp 500 company is a multifamilyfocused selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit we own operate acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states as of december 31 2021 we owned and operated 290 apartment communities which does not include development properties under construction through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and we had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture and had six development communities under construction in addition as of december 31 2021 33 of our apartment communities included retail components our apartment communities including development communities under construction were located across 16 states and the district of columbia as of december 31 2021

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2021 net income available for maa common shareholders was 5301 million as compared to 2513 million for the year ended december 31 2020 results for the year ended december 31 2021 included 2212 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets and 409 million of gain net of tax related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships results for the year ended december 31 2020 included 10 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets and 48 million of gain net of tax related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 60 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 driven by a 55 increase in our same store segment property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 48 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 driven by a 44 increase in our same store segment the primary drivers of these changes are discussed in the “results of operations” section 

trends 

during the year ended december 31 2021 revenue growth for our same store segment continued to be primarily driven by growth in average effective rent per unit the average effective rent per unit for our same store segment continued to increase from the prior year up 52 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020  average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing however it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit in addition for the year ended december 31 2021  average physical occupancy for our same store segment was 961 as compared to 956 for the year ended year ended december 31 2020  average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including both urban and suburban locations with a broad range of monthly rent price points will perform well in economic up cycles as well as better weather economic down cycles through our investment in 36 defined markets we are diversified across markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points 

  

while the united states economy continues to recover from the effects of the covid19 pandemic demand for apartments during the year ended december 31 2021 was very strong as evidenced by the accelerating rent growth we achieved demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth while our rent growth trends and rent collection trends during the year ended december 31 2021 were strong we continue to monitor pressures surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends a worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward and suppress demand for apartments and would likely drive rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than what we achieved during the year ended december 31 2021  elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets to date properties in suburban submarkets have been somewhat less impacted by supply primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets supply chain and inflationary pressures would likely drive higher operating expenses particularly in personnel and repairs and maintenance 

with the covid19 pandemic still impacting the country and contributing more uncertainty than normal we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets submarkets product types and rent price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile at a portfolio level we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy as previously noted average physical occupancy for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2021 was 961  which we believe positions us well to manage through the typically slower winter leasing season and progress toward the typically stronger spring and summer leasing season 

access to the financial markets remains strong particularly for high credit rated borrowers during 2021 we were able to efficiently raise capital through the debt market and we positioned ourselves to access the equity market in the event we have such a need however a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance maturing debt in the future the prospect of rising interest rates could negatively impact our borrowing costs for any variable rate borrowings or refinancing activity however as of december 31 2021 the interest rate on all of our outstanding debt was fixed and our fixed rate debt maturities in the year ending december 31 2022 are not significant 

results of operations 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 5301 million a 1110 increase as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 and total revenue growth of 1001 million representing a 60 increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 18 2021 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at httpswwwsecgov and on our website at httpswwwmaaccom on the “for investors” page under “filings and financials—annual reports” 

property revenues 

the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the year ended december 31 2021 dollars in thousands 

 the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth the same store segment generated a 55 increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 52 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in property revenues from the nonsame store and other segment for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of increased revenues from recently completed development communities these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31 2021 

  

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other operating expenses the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the year ended december 31 2021 dollars in thousands 

 the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of 70 million insurance expense of 62 million building repairs and maintenance of 56 million personnel expense of 44 million and utilities expense of 27 million the increase in property operating expenses from the nonsame store and other segment for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily the result of increased property operating expenses from recently completed development communities these increases were partially offset by decreased property operating expenses from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31 2021 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 5334 million an increase of 226 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and capital spend activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31 2021 

other income and expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 were 557 million an increase of 34 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 were 529 million an increase of 60 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 1569 million a decrease of 107 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 27 basis points in our effective interest rate during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements during the year ended december 31 2021  which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we disposed of seven apartment communities resulting in a gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets of 2204 million we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2021 we disposed of five land parcels resulting in a gain on sale of nondepreciable real estate assets of 08 million during the year ended december 31 2020  we disposed of one land parcel resulting in a gain on sale of nondepreciable real estate assets of 10 million 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2021 was 339 million of income as compared to 49 million of income for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily driven by 517 million of noncash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships compared to 56 million of noncash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships during the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2021 we also recognized 46 million of noncash expense related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares compared to the recognition of 26 million of noncash income related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 134 million in debt extinguishment costs expense recognized related to debt extinguishments during the year ended december 31 2020 was negligible during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 13 million of covid19 related expenses compared to 35 million of covid19 related expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 

funds from operations and core funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income available for maa common shareholders computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back ffo when used in this annual report on form 10k represents ffo attributable to the company 

  

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders or any other gaap measurement as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts’ or nareit’s definition it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

core ffo represents ffo as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares gain or loss on sale of nondepreciable assets gain or loss from unconsolidated limited partnerships net casualty gain or loss gain or loss on debt extinguishment legal costs and settlements covid19 related costs and marktomarket debt adjustments while our definition of core ffo may be similar to others in the industry our methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance we believe that core ffo is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure dollars in thousands

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2021 was 8306 million an increase of 693 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in property revenues of 1001 million and a decrease in interest expense of 107 million the increases to core ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 307 million general and administrative expenses of 60 million and property management expenses of 34 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources 

we expect that our primary uses of cash will be to fund our ongoing operating needs to fund our ongoing capital spending requirements which relate primarily to our development redevelopment and property repositioning activities to repay maturing borrowings to fund the future acquisition of assets and to pay shareholder dividends we expect to meet our cash requirements through net cash flows from operating activities existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility the future issuance of debt and equity and the future disposition of assets 

we historically have had positive net cash flows from operating activities we believe that future net cash flows generated from operating activities existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents borrowing capacity under our current commercial paper program and revolving credit facility and our ability to issue debt and equity will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the cash requirements for our business over the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

as of december 31 2021 we had 11 billion of combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8950 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 8239 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our operating performance 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2536 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 4847 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the primary drivers of the change were as follows dollars in thousands 

 the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by acquisition activity during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by reconstruction related capital spend due to winter storm uri in addition to increased redevelopment capital spend during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development activity during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from disposition of real estate assets was driven by the disposition of seven multifamily apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to no apartment community dispositions during the year ended december 31 2020 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5464 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 3741 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the primary drivers of the change were as follows dollars in thousands 

 the increase in cash outflows related to the net change in commercial paper resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of 1720 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the increase in net borrowings of 1020 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from notes payable primarily resulted from the issuance of 6000 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the issuance of 4500 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from the retirement of 2220 million of privately placed unsecured senior notes 1250 million of publicly issued unsecured senior notes and 1186 million of property mortgages during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the retirement of a 3000 million term loan and 1357 million of property mortgages during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to 410 per share during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the dividend rate of 400 per share during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in cash outflows from the net change in other financing activities was primarily driven by increased debt extinguishment costs paid during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 partially offset by increased cash inflows from contributions received from the noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated real estate entities

we typically declare cash dividends on maa’s common stock on a quarterly basis subject to approval by maa’s board of directors we expect to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 435 per share of maa common stock during the year ending december 31 2022 

inflation 

our resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal which may enable us to seek rent increases the majority of our leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting estimates 

a critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the estimates and assumptions summarized below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and they have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 805 business combinations which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements and other and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts on a relative fair value basis in calculating the asset value of acquired tangible and intangible assets management may use significant subjective inputs including forecasted net operating income or noi and market 

  

specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets management allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we did not acquire any real estate assets that required us to allocate the cost of the real estate asset to the individual acquired tangible and intangible assets 

impairment of longlived assets 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets management periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment rightofuse lease assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or an asset group management generally considers the individual assets of an apartment community to collectively represent an asset group recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing estimated future cash flows by a market capitalization rate no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

our impairment assessments contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of the assets key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and the fair value of an asset include projecting an apartment community’s noi estimating asset useful lives disposition dates and recurring capital expenditures as well as selecting an appropriate market capitalization rate management considers its apartment communities’ historical stabilized noi performance local market economics and the business environment impacting our apartment communities as the basis in projecting forecasted noi which management believes is representative of future cash flows management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then a statement to that effect is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex and qualitative judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim management’s assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any 

  

valuation of embedded derivative 

the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date with a corresponding noncash adjustment to the income statement the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1 2026 and at the redemption price of 50 per share we use various significant inputs in the analysis including trading data available on the preferred shares coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option as a result of the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value of the derivative asset the fair value of the embedded derivative asset decreased to 345 million as of december 31 2021 as compared to 390 million as of december 31 2020 a decrease in value of the asset of 45 million 

arriving at the valuation of the embedded derivative requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and the valuation of the embedded derivative is highly sensitive to changes in certain inputs in the analysis for example changes in the inputs of the trading data available on the preferred shares coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates could cause the valuation of the embedded derivative to materially change from the recorded balance as of december 31 2021 for instance holding all other assumptions constant a 1 decrease in the trading price of the preferred shares as of december 31 2021 would result in a decrease in fair value of the embedded derivative asset of approximately 6 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings as of december 31 2021 142 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and from time to time interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on anticipated future debt transactions we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes as of december 31 2021 1000 of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

development activities may be conducted through entities we whollyown through joint ventures or with our prepurchase transaction partners typically fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer during the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 2014 million in development costs and completed one development project

 

 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2020 dollars in thousands 

 







 

dispositions

 

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional equity or debt capital in deciding to sell an apartment community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual properties considering the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2020 we disposed of one land parcel totaling approximately 27 acres we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2020 

 

property redevelopment and repositioning activity

we focus on both interior unit upgrades and property amenity and common area upgrades above and beyond routine capital upkeep on our apartment communities that we believe have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2020 we renovated the kitchen and bathroom of 4211 apartment units at an average cost of 6201 per apartment unit achieving average rental rate increases of 95 above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated apartment units

 

during the first quarter of 2020 we began installing smarthome technology mobile control of lights thermostat and security as well as leak monitoring in some of our apartment units during the year ended december 31 2020 we installed smart devices in 23950 apartment units at an average cost of 1376 per apartment unit achieving an average rent increase of 25 per apartment unit 

 

also during the first quarter of 2020 we initiated a program to upgrade and reposition the amenity and common areas at select properties the program includes targeted plans to move all apartment units at the properties to higher rents for the year ended december 31 2020 we spent 130 million on this program at eight properties 

 

portfolio strategy

 

our goal is to maintain a diversified balanced portfolio that we believe provides the optimal path to maximizing operating performance over the full economic cycle maintaining a diverse portfolio includes

 









 

we believe a diverse portfolio performs well during economic up cycles and weathers economic down cycles better than a more homogenous portfolio

covid19 health and safety 

 

our highest priority throughout the covid19 pandemic has been the health and wellbeing of our associates residents and guests we have endeavored to provide protection and help with balancing the needs of the business with our crossfunctional covid19 task force we consider the evolving challenges presented to each of our stakeholder groups in accordance with us centers for disease control and prevention or cdc guidelines and directives from state and local governmental authorities we established our covid19 workplace health and safety guidelines which includes a requirement for each associate to complete a daily healthscreening questionnaire before work we instruct associates to wear face coverings frequently wash hands sanitize hightouch surfaces and practice social distancing while performing job responsibilities at all locations we introduced contact tracing measures with a dedicated team to manage incidents of associate covid19 exposure as additional protection for all associates and the public while our safety precautions have aimed to protect our associates’ health we also have implemented several measures to support our associates’ overall wellbeing throughout the pandemic we provided supplemental leave and sick time policies flextime additional covid19 paid time off and modifications to health and retirement plans 

capital structure

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining access flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively support normal business operations and source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturities to avoid disproportionate exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets

as of december 31 2020 233 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings including 209 under unsecured borrowings and 24 under secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 30 to 36 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our total debt to 60 or less of our adjusted total assets as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by maalp as of december 31 2020 our total debt was approximately 312 of our adjusted total assets we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flow from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments

competition and market demand

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing apartment communities offer features that our apartment communities do not have or may be deemed to be in a more desirable location within the market competing apartment communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing apartment communities are newer than our apartment communities may have different amenities or otherwise be more attractive to a prospective resident the competitive position of each apartment community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources greater ability to utilize leverage or lower capital costs than we do

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and acquisition and development opportunities we believe our competitive advantages include







 





moving forward we plan to continue our focus on optimizing lease expiration management expense control and resident retention efforts and also to align employee incentive plans with our performance we also plan to continue to make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational growth

for information regarding trends in market demand see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – trends” in this annual report on form 10k

environmental matters

as a part of our standard apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see “risk factors – risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly” in this annual report on form 10k 

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents

government regulations

we must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with the laws and regulations of the united states as well as state and local laws and regulations in the markets where our properties are located which may differ among jurisdictions in response to the covid19 pandemic federal governmental authorities as well as state and local governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our properties are located have implemented laws and regulations which impact our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course including our ability to charge certain fees increase rents and evict residents who violate their lease we are complying with these governmental requirements but they along with the covid19 pandemic had a material impact on our business in 2020 and ongoing compliance may materially effect our results of operations for the year ending december 31 2021 otherwise we do not expect that compliance with the various laws and regulations we are subject to will have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position for the year ending december 31 2021 as compared to prior periods 

for additional information see “risk factors – the covid19 pandemic and mitigation efforts to control the spread of the disease have materially impacted and are expected to continue to materially impact our business and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by factors relating to covid19” “risk factors – environmental problems are possible and can be costly” and “risk factors – compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations and the values of our properties” in this annual report on form 10k

qualification as a real estate investment trust

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state 

 

and local taxes on its income and its property in 2020  maa paid total distributions of  400 per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income

 item 1a risk factors

 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that are not presently known to us that we currently believe are immaterial or that could apply generically to any company may also significantly impact our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could suffer the market price of our stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our stock or debt securities

 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic

 

the covid19 pandemic and mitigation efforts to control the spread of the disease have materially impacted and are expected to continue to materially impact our business and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by factors relating to covid19

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic and the president of the united states proclaimed that the covid19 outbreak in the united states constituted a national emergency extraordinary actions were taken by federal state and local governmental authorities to combat the spread of covid19 including issuance of “stayathome” directives and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations these measures while intended to protect human life led to significantly reduced economic activity and a surge in unemployment throughout the united states including the markets where our properties are located in april 2020 the national unemployment rate reached its highest level since the great depression and in june 2020 the national bureau of economic research officially declared that the united states had fallen into a recession although some economists believe that the united states economy is now no longer in a recession the economy remains vulnerable a surge in new covid19 cases linked by public officials to increased travel and socializing over the holiday season seems to have begun to recede but tens of thousands of new cases are still being reported daily nationwide covid19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the united states government but vaccine distribution has been slower than public officials hoped and multiple variants of the virus that causes covid19 have been documented in the united states many jurisdictions continue to enforce orders restricting businesses’ normal operations and reinstatement of broader “stayathome” directives and mandates remains a possibility

our ability to lease our apartments and collect rental revenues is dependent upon national regional and local economic conditions particularly unemployment levels and personal income levels as unemployment rises and incomes fall fewer people including both current and prospective residents may be able to afford our apartment communities and it may be difficult for some of our residents to make timely rental payments to us under their leases

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread could have significant adverse impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows that are difficult to predict such adverse impacts will depend on among other factors









 















 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the current economic financial and capital markets environment present material risks and uncertainties for us however the fluidity of the situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact covid19 will have on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows which will depend largely on future developments directly or indirectly relating to the duration and scope of the covid19 pandemic in the united states to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations

unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our properties

unfavorable market and economic conditions in the areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our apartment communities at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to make distributions which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our apartment communities include the following among others

















 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flow could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include

 























at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors

as of december 31 2020 substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class

our operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate

as of december 31 2020 approximately 401 of our portfolio was located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas charlotte north carolina and orlando florida in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of our portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and acquisition and development opportunities

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and acquisition and development opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues and 2 acquisition and development opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay higher prices for new properties than we otherwise would have 

 

paid or m ay prevent us from purchasing desired propert ies at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such apartment communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal









 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our apartment communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns or allegations thereof arise

 

operations from new acquisitions development projects and redevelopment activities may fail to perform as expected

 

we intend to acquire develop and redevelop apartment communities as part of our business strategy newly acquired developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect we may also overestimate the revenue or underestimate the expenses that a new or repositioned property may generate the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may fail to meet our expectations underlying our investment 

 

in addition with respect to acquisitions we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations and the failure to successfully integrate those apartment communities or personnel would result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments likewise we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition state of title physical condition or 

 

compliance with zoning laws building codes or other legal requirements and in each case our acquisition may be without any or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results  

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility

we plan to sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy however adverse market conditions could limit our ability to sell properties when we want and to change our portfolio promptly to meet our strategic objectives likewise federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of properties and this limitation could prevent us from selling properties when market conditions are favorable from time to time we may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability

as of december 31 2020 we had eight development communities under construction representing 2607 units once complete we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks





















increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control for example the potential impact of climate change and the increased risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters could cause a significant increase in our insurance premiums and adversely affect the availability of coverage if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

 

we rely on information technology systems in our operations and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we rely on proprietary and thirdparty information technology systems to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes we store and maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us including web hosting property management leasing accounting payroll and benefit services the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us we take steps and generally require third party service providers to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers’ information technology systems including the use of systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information however we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or misconduct this risk of a data breach or security failure particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions

the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers’ systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed to not be detected and in fact may not be detected in addition thirdparty information technology providers may not provide us with fixes or updates to hardware or software in a manner as to avoid an unauthorized loss or disclosure or to address a known vulnerability which may subject us to known threats or downtime as a result of those delays accordingly we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures further we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and internal processes and procedures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities

a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers’ information technology systems and the information stored by us or our service providers including personally identifiable information of residents prospective residents and employees could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen any failure to prevent a data breach or a security failure of our or our service providers’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations result in downtime divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations similarly if our service providers fail to use adequate security or data protection processes or use personal data in an unpermitted or improper manner we may be liable for certain losses and it may damage our reputation

compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations and the values of our properties

we must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations for example the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

we do not know whether the legal requirements we are subject to will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in laws and regulations could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures and limit our ability to recover increases in operating expenses impose limitations on our ability to increase rents or charge certain fees impose limitations on our ability to enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent or otherwise adversely impact our operations for example we have seen an increase in state and local governments implementing considering or being urged by tenant advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as tenants’ rights laws and regulations any such future enactments in the markets in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties

 

legal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business 

as an owner operator and developer of multifamily apartment communities we may become involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to commercial development employment environmental securities shareholder tenant or tort legal issues some of which could result in a class action lawsuit for example as described in more detail in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are currently a defendant in two class action lawsuits relating to tenant late fee policies at our texas apartment communities

legal proceedings if decided adversely to or settled by us and not covered by insurance could result in liability material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows likewise regardless of outcome legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject 

extreme weather or natural disasters may cause significant damage to our properties and losses from catastrophes could exceed our insurance coverage

many of our apartment communities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters such as floods hurricanes and earthquakes the likelihood or frequency of which events could increase in part based on the impact of climate change such events may cause significant damage to our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our residents there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business

we carry property insurance on our apartment communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and therefore may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining what we believe is appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties

 

acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

 

our apartment communities could directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings or other acts of violence the occurrence of which could impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as result in operational losses due to reduced rental demand and the availability of insurance may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our apartment communities we may also become subject to significant liability claims in addition the adverse effects that actual or threatened terrorist attacks could have on national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

as of december 31 2020 the amount of our total debt was 46 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following













 

if any one of these events was to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms if at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code

rising interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on our variablerate debt or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixedrate debt which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock any increase in the federal funds rate due to key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the phaseout of libor could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally libor is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility although we had no borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 the ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor has announced that it plans to cease the publication of oneweek and twomonth us dollar usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and to cease the publications of the remaining tenors of usd libor one three six and 12month immediately after june 30 2023 at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has endorsed replacing usd libor with the secured overnight financing rate or sofr sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities however us banking regulators have indicated that financial institutions will be permitted to choose any benchmark rate to replace libor given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and will span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition

we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings including our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of apartment communities which no longer meet our investment criteria in addition we may fund other of our capital requirements through additional debt our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may incur more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding borrowings of 46 billion our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others and cross default provisions with other material debt our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by 

 

changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

financing may not be available and could be dilutive

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 

we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets which could result in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing likewise disruptions could impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again becomes limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted

risks related to maa’s organization and ownership of its stock

maa’s ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock

maa’s charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa























 



the redemption price may be paid at maa’s option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed

if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above







future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to maa’s stock may adversely affect the market price of maa’s stock

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to maa’s common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of maa’s common stock and may result in dilution to owners of maa’s common stock we and indirectly maa’s shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future offerings thus holders of maa’s common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of maa’s common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time

provisions of maa’s charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa

ownership limit

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors

preferred stock

maa’s charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 868000 of which have been designated as 850 series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2020 867846 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock

tennessee antitakeover statutes

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maa’s acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests

thirdparty expectations relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks

we have a significant institutional investor base and there is an increasing focus from institutional investors and other stakeholders on corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance or esg factors some institutional investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and many institutional investors focus on positive esg business practices and may consider a company’s esg score when making an investment decision in addition many 

 

institutional investors may use esg scores to benchmark companies against their peers thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards in addition the criteria by which companies’ esg practices are assessed are evolving which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy any new criteria alternatively if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific thirdparty provider some investors may conclude that our esg business practices are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility standards do not meet the standards set by various stakeholders in addition in the event that we communicate certain esg initiatives and goals we could fail or be perceived to have failed in our achievement of our initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the esg expectations of investors and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results and the market price of maa’s common stock could be adversely affected 

market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa’s common stock

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maa’s common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maa’s borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maa’s common stock to go down 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa’s common stock

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maa’s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa’s common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa’s shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa’s common stock

the stock markets including the nyse on which maa lists its common stock have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maa’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maa’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of maa’s publicly traded securities may be affected by many factors including but not limited to the following





































in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources

 

risks related to the operating partnership ’ s organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnership’s existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnership’s sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa’s ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnership’s unitholders must approve the operating partnership’s sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership’s unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership’s affairs

maa as the operating partnership’s sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnership’s affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the unitholders of the operating partnership also maa owns approximately 966 of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership’s unitholders for approval

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa’s common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations

the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make payments on its debt and to make distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to make distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment to make payments on its debt or to make distributions to its unitholders

risks related to tax laws

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of maa’s common stock

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trs and those trs will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits

 

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if any reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

in the past we have acquired companies that operated in a manner intended to allow them to qualify as reits for us federal income tax purposes if any such reit previously acquired by maa referred to as a merged reit is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including





maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were “investment companies” under the “investment company” rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s business prospects financial condition or results of operations and on maa’s ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition

any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions

 

legislative or regulatory income tax changes related to reits could materially and adversely affect us 

the us federal income tax laws and regulations governing reits and their shareholders as well as the administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations are constantly under review and may be changed at any time possibly with retroactive effect no assurance can be given as to whether when or in what form changes to the us federal income tax laws applicable to us and maa’s shareholders may be enacted changes to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations of us federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in maa’s stock

covid19 developments

 

we believe the best way we can help our residents is to work with those who have lost wages or compensation due to the covid19 pandemic so that they can remain in their homes during 2020 we supported our impacted residents in need of assistance by

 









 

our onsite leasing offices have remained open throughout the covid19 pandemic while adhering to orders and directives issued by state and local governments since may 2020 we have conducted normal operations at our onsite leasing offices permitting public access and walkin traffic subject to social distancing restrictions further since may 2020 property amenities have been open as permitted by governmental orders directives and guidelines 

 

we have supported our associates with enhanced leave and sick time policies enhanced flextime arrangements and additional covid19 paid time off among other benefits we continue to monitor and comply with the various federal state and local laws orders and directives issued in response to the covid19 pandemic that affect apartment owners and operators 

trends

during the year ended december 31 2020 revenue growth for our same store portfolio continued to be favorably impacted by inplace rents and the contribution of average effective rent per unit growth the average effective rent per unit for our same store portfolio continued to increase from the prior year up 26 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 this growth was partially offset by a slightly lower average physical occupancy for our same store portfolio of 956 as compared to the average physical occupancy of 959 achieved during the more normal operating conditions for the year ended december 31 2019 average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing 

 

concessions for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing however it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit   average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period 

 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including both urban and suburban locations with a broad range of monthly rent price points will perform well in “up” cycles as well as better weather “down” cycles through our investment in 36 defined markets we are diversified across markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points

the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt the united states economy and we cannot predict when a full economic recovery will occur demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth government restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic continue to drive high unemployment and limit the number of people looking to change their current living situation while our rent collections during the second half of the year ended december 31 2020 increased as compared to the rent collections during the initial stages of the pandemic for the full year collections were lower than the year ended december 31 2019 the current environment could contribute to lower than normal rent collections in 2021 and continue to suppress demand for apartments likely driving rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than it would be in a more normal economic environment current elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets properties in suburban submarkets continue to be somewhat less impacted by supply primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets

markets throughout the country have been impacted differently by the pandemic the individual market economies continue to be at various stages of reopening and we expect them to stay this way for some period further as new covid19 infections continue to occur in most areas of the country including the markets where we operate we are unable to predict if economies will continue to remain open or if they will be disrupted again in the near future as we move through this uncertain time we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile 

our focus during this challenging time has been on working with residents who have been financially impacted by the pandemic on rent payment flexibility at a portfolio level we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy as noted above average physical occupancy for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2020 was 956 which we believe positions us well to manage through the current environment and as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season 

while access to the financial markets was initially disrupted by the covid19 pandemic access has returned particularly for high credit borrowers with our successful bond issuance in the third quarter of 2020 we demonstrated our ability to efficiently raise capital through the debt market and believe we could do the same in the equity market as necessary however a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance our limited nearterm maturing debt

 

results of operations

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 2513 million a 282 decrease as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 and total revenue growth of 370 million representing a 23 increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the decrease in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 20 2020 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and on our website at httpswwwmaaccom on the “for investors” page under “filings and financials—annual reports” 

property revenues

the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 dollars in thousands



 

the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth the same store segment generated a 25 increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2020  primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 26 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  the rollout of the new highspeed bulk cable internet package contributed 06 in same store segment revenue growth  the decrease in property revenues from the nonsame store and other segment for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily resulted from decreased revenues from the disposition of five multifamily properties located in the little rock arkansas market during the fourth quarter of 2019 which marked our exit from that particular market these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from recently completed development properties 

 

property operating expenses

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other operating expenses the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 dollars in thousands

 



the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of 98 million utilities expense of 54 million insurance expense of 49 million and marketing expense of 35 million the rollout of the new highspeed bulk cable internet package contributed 04 in expense growth for the same store segment and is reflected in the increase in utilities expense 

depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was 5108 million an increase of 140 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and redevelopment activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31 2020

other income and expenses

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 were 523 million a decrease of 27 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 were 469 million an increase of 30 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was 1676 million a decrease of 123 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 12 basis points in our effective interest rate an increase in capitalized interest and a decrease in average daily debt outstanding during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements during the year ended december 31 2020 which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period the increase in the capitalized interest expense was due to an increase in the number of development projects 

we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2019 we disposed of five apartment communities resulting in gains on sale of depreciable real estate assets of 810 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we disposed of one land parcel resulting in a gain on sale of nondepreciable real estate assets of 10 million during the year ended december 31 2019  we disposed of four land parcels resulting in gains on sale of nondepreciable real estate assets of 120 million 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2020 was 49 million of income as compared to 230 million of income for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by the recognition of 26 million of noncash income related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the recognition of 179 million of noncash income related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31 2019 during the year ended december 31 2020 we also recognized 56 million of noncash income relating to an unconsolidated limited partnership and 35 million of covid19 related expenses in other nonoperating income compared to 39 million of noncash income relating to an unconsolidated limited partnership during the year ended december 31 2019 our covid19 related expenses consisted primarily of cleaning supplies contract labor and covid19 related leave

 

funds from operations and core funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income available for maa common shareholders computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures because noncontrolling interest is added back ffo when used in this annual report on form 10k represents ffo attributable to the company

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common stockholders or any other gaap measurement as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts’ or nareit’s definition it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

core ffo represents ffo as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares  gain or loss on sale of nondepreciable assets adjustments for gains or losses from unconsolidated limited partnerships net casualty gain or loss gain or loss on debt extinguishment nonroutine legal costs and settlements covid19 related costs and marktomarket debt adjustments while our definition of core ffo may be similar to others in the industry our methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance we believe that core ffo is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure dollars in thousands











core ffo for the year ended december 31 2020 was 7614 million an increase of 222 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily as a result of an increase in property revenues of 370 million and decreases in interest expense of 123 million and property management expenses of 27 million the increases to core ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 276 million and general and administrative expenses of 30 million

we have commitments which are not reflected in the table above to make additional capital contributions to two technology focused limited partnerships in which we hold equity interests the capital contributions may be called by the general partners at any time until february 2025 after giving appropriate notice as of december 31 2020 we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to 192 million if and when called by the general partners of the limited partnerships and until february 2025

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had an ownership interest in a limited liability company that owns one apartment community comprised of 269 units located in washington dc we also had ownership interests in two technology focused limited partnerships as of december 31 2020 our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not have any relationships including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

insurance

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2020  we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

inflation

our resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal which may enable us to seek rent increases the majority of our leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation

critical accounting policies and estimates

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical

acquisition of real estate assets

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards update 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements and other and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts on a relative fair value basis in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets management uses stabilized net operating income or noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired

impairment of longlived assets

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets management periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment rightofuse lease assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing projected cash flows based on historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred therefore repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary costs during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized

 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then a statement to that effect is disclosed

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim management’s assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any

 

valuation of embedded derivative

 

the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date with a corresponding noncash adjustment to the income statement the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1 2026 and at the redemption price of 50 per share we use various inputs in the analysis including trading data available on the preferred shares coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings as of december 31 2020 233 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on anticipated future debt transactions we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes as of december 31 2020 962 of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

 item 1 business

overview

maa an sp 500 company is a multifamilyfocused selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit we own operate acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states as of december 31 2019 we maintained full or partial ownership of apartment communities and commercial properties across 16 states and the district of columbia summarized as follows

 



1 excludes commercial space located at our multifamily apartment communities which totals approximately 630000 square feet of gross leasable space

our business is conducted principally through the operating partnership maa is the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 114246393 op units comprising a 966 partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2019 maa and maalp were formed in tennessee in 1993 as of december 31 2019 we had 2476 fulltime employees and 37 parttime employees

 

business objectives 

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies









operations

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the income producing capacity of each apartment community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include

















we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior management and the properties on a realtime basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies and continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information

investment in technology continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications contracts and renewals via the use of our webbased resident internet portal interacting with our residents through such technology has allowed us to improve resident satisfaction ratings and increase the efficiency of our operating teams

acquisitions

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in various markets throughout the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and asset allocation portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing management and overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of apartment communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and we will utilize this strategy to increase our number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

 

we acquired the following properties during the year ended december 31 2019  

 







3 we acquired the ground floor retail portion of one of our existing multifamily apartment communities

dispositions

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital in deciding to sell an apartment community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual properties considering the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2019 we disposed of five multifamily communities totaling 1368 units our former corporate office and four land parcels totaling approximately 83 acres

development

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties typically fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we intend to maintain a total development commitment that we consider modest in relation to our total balance sheet and investment portfolio during the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred 1129 million in development costs and completed 2 development projects

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2019 dollars in thousands

 







 

redevelopment

we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep on existing apartment communities across our portfolio that we believe have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended 

 

december 31 2019  we renovated 8329 units at an average cost of 5876 per unit achieving average rental rate increases of 98 above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

capital structure

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining access flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively support normal business operations and source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturities to avoid disproportionate exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets

as of december 31 2019 222 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings including 191 under unsecured borrowings and 31 under secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 30 to 36 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our total debt to 60 or less of our adjusted total assets as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by maalp as of december 31 2019 our total debt was approximately 314 of our adjusted total assets we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flow from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments

competition

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing apartment communities offer features that our apartment communities do not have competing apartment communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing apartment communities are larger or newer than our apartment communities the competitive position of each apartment community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include











moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease expiration management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our performance we also plan to continue to make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational growth

environmental matters

as a part of our standard apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of 

 

contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see “ risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly ” 

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents

qualification as a real estate investment trust

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2019 maa paid total distributions of 384 per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could suffer the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations

unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our properties

unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our apartment communities at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to make distributions which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our apartment communities include the following among others

















failure to generate sufficient cash flow could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include























 





at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors

as of december 31 2019 substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class

our operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate

as of december 31 2019 approximately 399 of our portfolio is located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas charlotte north carolina and orlando florida in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of our portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected

failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and development and acquisition opportunities

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

our apartment communities could directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings or other acts of violence the occurrence of which could impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as result in operational losses due to reduced rental demand and the availability of insurance may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our apartment communities we may also become subject to significant liability claims in addition the adverse effects that actual or threatened terrorist attacks could have on national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

 

we rely on information technology systems in our operations and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we rely on proprietary and thirdparty information technology systems to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes we store and maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us including web hosting property management leasing accounting and payroll services the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us we take steps and generally require third party service providers to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers information technology systems including the use of systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information however we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or misconduct this risk of a data breach or security failure particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions

the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed to not be detected and in fact may not be detected in addition thirdparty information technology providers may not provide us with fixes or updates to hardware or software in a manner as to avoid an unauthorized loss or disclosure or to address a known vulnerability which may subject us to known threats or downtime as a result of those delays accordingly we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures further we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and internal processes and procedures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities

a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers information technology systems and the information stored by us or our service providers including personally identifiable information of residents prospective residents and employees could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen any failure to prevent a data breach or a security failure of our or our service providers information technology systems could interrupt our operations result in downtime divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations similarly if our service providers fail to use adequate security or data protection processes or use personal data in an unpermitted or improper manner we may be liable for certain losses and it may damage our reputation

acquisitions of apartment communities involve various risks and may fail to meet expectations

we have acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks















 



we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities





property ownership through joint ventures could limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest

from time to time we may acquire andor develop properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures in that case we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover our partners could have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners could have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners could each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of our partners interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arms length marketing process other potential risks of a jointlyowned property include i a deadlock if we and our partners are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii a limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partners and iii a requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owners or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos

 

containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such apartment communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal









certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our apartment communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns or allegations thereof arise

extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations 

we have apartment communities located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes winds floods hurricanes and fires the likelihood or frequency of which events could increase in part based on the potential impact of climate change such conditions may damage our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our tenants there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our apartment communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control for example the potential impact of climate change and the increased risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters could cause a significant increase in our insurance premiums and adversely affect the availability of coverage if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected

 

compliance or failure to comply with laws and regulations including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons  could have an adverse effect on our operations  

we must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop our properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations for example the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

we do not know whether the legal requirements we are subject to will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in laws and regulations could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures impose limitations on our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees or otherwise adversely impact our operations for example we generally have seen growing activism from tenant advocacy groups which often urge state and local governments to consider enacting rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as tenants’ rights laws and regulations any such future enactments in the markets in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties

development and construction risks could impact our profitability

as of december 31 2019 we had seven development communities under construction totaling 2108 units we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks





















shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

legal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business

as an owner operator and developer of multifamily apartment communities we may become involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to commercial development employment environmental securities shareholder tenant or tort legal issues some of which could result in a class action lawsuit for example as described in more detail 

 

in “ legal proceedings ” and note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are currently a defendant in two class action lawsuits relating to tenant late fee policies at our texas apartment communities 

legal proceedings if decided adversely to or settled by us and not covered by insurance could result in liability material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows likewise regardless of outcome legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

as of december 31 2019 the amount of our total debt was approximately 45 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following













if any one of these events was to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms if at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code

rising interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on our variablerate debt or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixedrate debt which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock any increase in the federal funds rate due to key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the uncertainty regarding the potential phaseout of libor could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally libor is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable 

 

rate debt including our unsecured revolving credit facility  libor is expected to be phased out after 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate without this data libor may no longer be published or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor although the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate  or sofr sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including  but not limited to  how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and will span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt  which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows  

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition

we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings including our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of apartment communities which no longer meet our investment criteria in addition we may fund other of our capital requirements through additional debt our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may incur more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments

as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 45 billion our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others and cross default provisions with other material debt our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations

from time to time we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

financing may not be available and could be dilutive

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 

we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets which could result in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing likewise disruptions could impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again becomes limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs 

 

associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted  

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa























the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed

if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above







future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to our common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings

 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa

ownership limit

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors

preferred stock

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 868000 of which have been designated as 850 series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2019 867846 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock

tennessee antitakeover statutes

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas common stock

the stock markets including the nyse on which maa lists its common stock have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following









 



























in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the unitholders of the operating partnership also maa owns approximately 966 of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may 

 

find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations

the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make payments on its debt and to make distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to make distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment to make payments on its debt or to make distributions to its unitholders

risks related to tax laws

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of maa’s common stock

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trs and those trs will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year

if any reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

in the past we have acquired companies that operated in a manner intended to allow them to qualify as reits for us federal income tax purposes if any such reit previously acquired by maa referred to as a merged reit is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including





maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously 

 

held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were “ investment companies ” under the “ investment company ” rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s business prospects financial condition or results of operations and on maa’s ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition

any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions

overview

for the year ended december 31 2019 net income available for maa common shareholders was 3501 million as compared to 2192 million for the year ended december 31 2018 results for the year ended december 31 2019 included 179 million of income related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares and 930 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets results for the year ended december 31 2018 included 26 million of 

 

expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative and 45 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 44  as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  driven by a 3 4  increase in our same store segment and a n   185  increase in our nonsame store and other segment property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 31  as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  driven by a 29  increase in our same store segment and a 55 increase in our nonsame store and other segment the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the “ results of operations ” section 

over the past three years our growth has partially been driven by our acquisition and development strategy to invest in growing markets in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states we acquired one apartment community in 2019 one in 2018 and two in 2017 five apartment communities were disposed in 2019 and five apartment communities were disposed in 2017 no apartment communities were disposed in 2018 two multifamily development projects were completed in 2019 three in 2018 and seven in 2017 

trends

during the year ended december 31 2019 we were favorably impacted by rent pricing growth throughout the year average effective rent per unit for the same store portfolio continued to increase up 36 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 average daily physical occupancy for our same store portfolio was 959 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared with the average daily physical occupancy of 961 achieved during the year ended december 31 2018 

 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including inner loop suburban and downtowncentral business district locations with various monthly rent price points will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better through our investment in 36 defined markets we are diversified across markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of product types and monthly rent pricing points

 

though overall demand continues to be strong the current elevated supply levels are impacting rent growth for our portfolio particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets properties in suburban submarkets have been impacted somewhat less by supply primarily because less new development has occurred in those submarkets multifamily permitting is typically a leading indicator of future supply levels multifamily permitting across our markets was up in 2018 as compared to 2017 and the us census bureaus data for 2019 suggested multifamily permitting across our markets was up as compared to 2018 it is difficult to project supply levels based on this data because not all permitted projects are ultimately built however given the current supply level and the 2019 permitting data we believe that supply in some of our markets could remain elevated over the next couple of years

demand for our apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets in particular job growth relative to new supply is a critical factor in our ability to maintain occupancy and increase rents to the extent that economic conditions continue to support increased job growth we believe that we may be able to maintain solid occupancy and more effectively increase rents we also believe that the existing disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at multifamily apartment communities furthermore rental competition from single family homes has not historically been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets for the year ended december 31 2019 total move outs attributable to single family home rentals for our combined portfolio represented less than 6 of total move outs down from approximately 7 for the year ended december 31 2018 long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions will continue to support apartment rental demand in our markets

changing interest rates may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 45 billion of debt of which 2 had variable rate interest and 98 had fixed or hedged interest rates to the extent interest rates rise our net interest expense on variable rate debt will increase as will potentially our net interest expense on any debt refinancing the opposite is true should interest rates decrease given the shortterm nature of our leases to the extent interest rates rise due to general economic growth we would expect increases in interest expense to be somewhat offset by positive leasing trends

our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system as noted above average daily physical occupancy for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2019 was 959 as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season we believe that the current level of physical occupancy and continued strong job growth in our markets position us well for this period and sets us up to achieve continued pricing growth in 2020

 

results of operations 

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 3501 million a 597 increase as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 and total revenue growth of 697 million representing a 44 increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 21 2019 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and on our website at httpswwwmaaccom on the “for investors” page under “filings and financials—annual reports” 

property revenues

the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 dollars in thousands

 



 

the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth the same store segment generated a 34 increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 36 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in property revenues from the nonsame store and other segment for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to year ended december 31 2018 was primarily the result of continued leaseup of our development communities

property operating expenses

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other operating expenses the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 dollars in thousands

 



 

the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in real estate tax expense of 100 million the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other segment was driven by an increase in real estate tax expense primarily due to the recent completion of apartment communities previously in our development pipeline

depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 4968 million an increase of 71 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and redevelopment activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31 2019

other income and expenses

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 were 550 million an increase of 74 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to increases in personnel and technology costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 were 461 million an increase of 113 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to increases in personnel and legal costs no merger and integration expenses were incurred during the year ended december 31 2019 which represented a decrease of 91 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 1798 million an increase of 63 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 14 basis points in our effective 

 

interest rate during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in the effective interest rate was primarily due to the recent maturity of debt we assumed in previous corporate acquisitions 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we disposed of five apartment communities resulting in gains on sale of depreciable real estate assets of 810 million we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2018 the gain on sale of nondepreciable assets for the year ended december 31 2019 was 120 million an increase of 75 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  although annual land disposition volume remained consistent yearoveryear the gain on sale of nondepreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2019 was 253 million an increase of 198 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to the recognition of 179 million of income related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the recognition of 26 million of expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31 2018

funds from operations

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income available for maa common shareholders computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures because noncontrolling interest is added back ffo when used in this annual report on form 10k represents ffo attributable to the company

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common stockholders or any other gaap measurement as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts’ or nareits definition it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure dollars in thousands



 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2019 was 7732 million an increase of 605 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily as a result of increases in property revenues of 697 million other nonoperating income of 198 million and gain on sale of nondepreciable assets of 75 million in addition to a decrease in merger and integration expenses of 91 million the increases to ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 183 million general and administrative expenses of 113 million property management expenses of 74 million and interest expense of 63 million

insurance

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2019 we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operations

inflation

our resident leases at our apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases the majority of our leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical

acquisition of real estate assets

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards update 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements and other and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts on a relative fair value basis in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets management uses stabilized net operating income or noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired

impairment of longlived assets

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets management periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing projected cash flows based on historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred therefore repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary costs during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized

loss contingencies

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then a statement to that effect is disclosed

 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim managements assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any 

 

valuation of embedded derivative

 

the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date with a corresponding noncash adjustment to the income statement the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1 2026 and at the redemption price of 50 per share we use various inputs in the analysis including trading data available on the preferred shares coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings as of december 31 2019 222 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes as of december 31 2019 984 of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates after considering related derivative instruments we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

maa is a multifamily focused selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit we own operate acquire and selectively develop apartment communities located in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states as of december 31 2018  we maintained full or partial ownership of apartment communities and commercial properties across 17 states and the district of columbia summarized as follows 



1    excludes commercial space located at our multifamily apartment communities which totals approximately 615000  square feet of gross leasable space 

our business is conducted principally through the operating partnership maa is the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 113844267  op units comprising a 965  partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2018  maa and maalp were formed in tennessee in 1993 as of december 31 2018  we had 2508  fulltime employees and 44  parttime employees 

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

operations 

  

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the income producing capacity of each apartment community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior management and the properties on a realtime basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies and continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a yield management pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

investment in technology continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals via the use of our webbased resident internet portal interacting with our residents through such technology has allowed us to improve resident satisfaction ratings and increase the efficiency of our operating teams 

acquisitions 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in various markets throughout the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and asset allocation portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing management and overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of apartment 

communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and we will utilize this strategy to increase our number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

we acquired the following properties during the year ended december 31 2018  



1 we acquired the ground floor retail portion of one of our existing multifamily apartment communities 

dispositions 

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital in deciding to sell an apartment community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual properties considering the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2018  we disposed of five  land parcels totaling approximately 76 acres 

  

development 

  

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties typically fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we intend to maintain a total development commitment that we consider modest in relation to our total balance sheet and investment portfolio during the year ended december 31 2018  we incurred 571 million  in development costs and completed 3 development projects 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2018  dollars in thousands 



redevelopment 

we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep on existing apartment communities across our portfolio that we believe have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2018  we renovated 8155  units at an average cost of 6138  per unit achieving average rental rate increases of 105  above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

  

capital structure 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining access flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment 

opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturities to avoid disproportionate exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

  

as of december 31 2018  286  of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings including 256  under unsecured credit facilities and unsecured senior notes and 30  under secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 32 to 38 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our total debt to 60 or less of our adjusted total assets as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by maalp as of december 31 2018  our total debt was approximately 326  of our adjusted total assets we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flows from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing apartment communities offer features that our apartment communities do not have competing apartment communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing apartment communities are larger or newer than our apartment communities the competitive position of each apartment community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease expiration management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our performance we also plan to continue to make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

environmental matters 

  

as a part of our standard apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies 

generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

merger with post properties 

we completed our merger with post properties inc or post properties on december 1 2016 accordingly the consolidated net assets and results of operations of post properties are included in our consolidated financial statements from and after the merger closing date 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2018  maa paid total distributions of 369  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income 

recent developments 

in february 2019 we closed on the disposition of a 04 acre land parcel located in the atlanta georgia market resulting in a net gain of 90 million on the sale of nondepreciable real estate assets recognized in the first quarter of 2019 the gain on sale of nondepreciable real estate assets was not reflected in our initial earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2019 or the full year of 2019 we will review our 2019 earnings guidance in our earnings release and conference call discussing results for the quarter ending march 31 2019 

in february 2019 we entered into a 1913 million  fixed rate secured property mortgage with a fixed rate of 443 maturing in february 2049

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could suffer the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our properties 

unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our apartment communities at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to make distributions which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our apartment communities include the following among others 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 



 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors 

as of december 31 2018  substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 394  of our portfolio is located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas charlotte north carolina and orlando florida in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of our portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance 

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

our apartment communities could directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings or other acts of violence the occurrence of which could impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as result in operational losses due to reduced rental demand and the availability of insurance may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our apartment communities we may also become subject to significant liability claims in addition the adverse effects that actual or threatened terrorist attacks could have on national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on information technology systems in our operations and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes we maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us including web hosting property management leasing accounting and payroll services the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us we take steps and generally require third party service providers to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers information technology systems including the use of systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information however we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or misconduct this risk of a breach or security failure particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions 

the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed to not be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we and our providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures further in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers information technology systems and the information stored by us or our service providers including personally identifiable information of residents prospective residents and employees could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen any failure to prevent a breach or a security failure of our or our service providers information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

acquisitions of apartment communities involve various risks and may fail to meet expectations 

we have acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 



 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

 

property ownership through joint ventures could limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest 

from time to time we may acquire andor develop properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures in that case we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover our partners could have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners could have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we 

may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners could each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of our partners interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arms length marketing process other potential risks of a jointlyowned property include i a deadlock if we and our partners are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii a limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partners and iii a requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owners or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such apartment communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal 

 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our apartment communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations   

we have apartment communities located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes winds floods hurricanes and fires such conditions may damage our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our tenants there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties 

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our apartment communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties 

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the fair housing act of 1988 or the fha and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2018  we had three  development communities under construction totaling 577  units we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 



 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

legal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could affect our business 

as an owner operator and developer of multifamily apartment communities we may become involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to commercial development employment environmental securities shareholder tenant or tort legal issues some of which could result in a class action lawsuit for example as described in more detail in legal proceedings and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are currently a defendant in two class action lawsuits relating to tenant late fee policies at our texas apartment communities 

legal proceedings if decided adversely to or settled by us and not covered by insurance could result in liability material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows likewise regardless of outcome legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  the amount of our total debt was approximately 45 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

   

if any one of these events was to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not 

be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms if at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on our variablerate debt or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixedrate debt which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock during 2018 the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate by 025 points each quarter resulting in a range of 225 percent to 25 percent after the federal reserves december 2018 meeting these increases in the federal funds rate and any future increases due to other key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of apartment communities which no longer meet our investment criteria in addition we may fund other of our capital requirements through debt our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may incur more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 45 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others and cross default provisions with other material debt our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from time to time we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the 

three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain debt financing if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

 

future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to our common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 868000  of which have been designated as 850 series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2018  867846  shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock 

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a 

percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

the stock markets including the nyse on which maa lists its common stock have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 

   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the unitholders of the operating partnership also maa owns approximately 965  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

t he operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make payments on its debt and to make distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to make distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment to make payments on its debt or to make distributions to its unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of maa’s common stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters 

and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit 

even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits 

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if any reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

prior to the merger with post properties post properties operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes if post properties or any other reit previously acquired by maa each a merged reit is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including 

 

maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were investment companies under the investment company rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s business prospects financial condition or results of operations and on maa’s ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a 

corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders above 

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition 

  any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions 

the recently enacted legislation informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act and other legislative regulatory and administrative developments may adversely affect maa or its shareholders 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law pl 11597 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act or the tax act the tax act makes major changes to the code including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their shareholders certain provisions of the tax act that may impact us and our shareholders include 

 

the individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the tax act on maa and its shareholders is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time in addition other legislative regulatory or administrative changes may be enacted or promulgated either prospectively or with retroactive effect and may adversely affect maa or its shareholders maas shareholders and prospective shareholders should consult their individual tax advisors regarding the implications of the tax act and other potential legislative regulatory or administrative changes on their investment in maas capital stock

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2018  net income available for maa common shareholders was 2192 million  compared to 3247 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  results for the year ended december 31 2018  included 26 million  of expense related to the marktomarket adjustment of the bifurcated embedded derivative related to the maa series i preferred stock issued in the merger with post properties and 45 million  of gains related to the sale of real estate assets results for the year ended december 31 2017  included 88 million  of income related to the adjustment of the bifurcated embedded derivative and 1274 million  of gains related to the sale of real estate assets revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 28  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  driven by a 19  increase in our same store segment and a 135 increase in our nonsame store and other segment property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 31 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  due to a 20 increase in our same store segment and to a 146 increase in our nonsame store and other segment the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

over the past three years our growth has been driven by our acquisition strategy to invest in growing markets in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states as a result of the merger with post properties we acquired 61 apartment communities in 2016 we acquired one  apartment community in 2018  two  in 2017  and five  in 2016  apart from the merger with post properties no  apartment communities were disposed in 2018  we disposed of five  apartment communities in 2017  and 12  in 2016  

trends 

during the year ended december 31 2018  demand for apartments continued to be relatively strong as it was during the year ended december 31 2017  average daily physical occupancy for our same store portfolio was 961  for the year ended december 31 2018  in line with the 961  average daily physical occupancy achieved during the year ended december 31 2017  average effective rent per unit from our same store portfolio continued to increase up 19  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points in the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including inner loop suburban and downtowncentral business district locations and various monthly rent price points will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better through our investment in 38 defined metropolitan statistical areas we are diversified across markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of monthly rent pricing points 

though overall demand continues to be strong the current elevated supply levels are impacting rent growth for our portfolio particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets properties in suburban submarkets have been impacted somewhat less by supply primarily because less new development has occurred in those submarkets multifamily permitting is typically a leading indicator of future supply levels while multifamily permitting across our markets was down in 2017 as compared to 2016 to date the us census bureaus data for 2018 suggested multifamily permitting across our markets was up as compared to 2017 it is difficult to project supply levels based on this data because not all permitted projects are ultimately built however given the current supply level and the 2018 permitting data it is possible that supply in some of our markets could remain elevated over the next couple of years 

demand for our apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets in particular job growth relative to new supply is a critical factor in our ability to maintain occupancy and increase rents to the extent that economic conditions continue to support increased job growth we believe that we may be able to maintain occupancy more effectively and increase rents also we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to 

favor rental demand at existing multifamily apartment communities furthermore rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018  total move outs attributable to single family home rentals for our portfolio represented less than 7 of total move outs as it did in the year ended december 31 2017  we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast southwest and midatlantic regions will continue to support apartment rental demand in our markets 

rising interest rates may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 45 billion  of debt of which 25  had variable rate interest and 75  had fixed or hedged interest rates to the extent interest rates rise our net interest expense on variable rate debt will increase as will potentially our net interest expense on any debt refinancing given the shortterm nature of our leases to the extent interest rates rise due to general economic growth we would expect increases in interest expense to be somewhat offset by positive leasing trends 

our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system as noted above average daily physical occupancy for the year ended december 31 2018 was sustained at 961  as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season we believe that the current level of physical occupancy and continued strong job growth in our markets position us well for this period and sets us up to achieve modestly improved pricing growth in 2019 

  

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2018  to the year ended december 31 2017   

for the year ended december 31 2018  we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 2192 million  a 325  decrease as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  and total revenue growth of 424 million  representing a 28  increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the decrease in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  

property revenues 

the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property revenues for our same store segment as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  was the primary driver of total property revenue growth the same store segment generated a 19  increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 19  and stable occupancy as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in property revenues from the nonsame store and other segment for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to year ended december 31 2017  was primarily the result of recent property acquisitions and continued leaseup of recent development communities 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other operating expenses the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



  

the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of 77 million  and personnel expenses of 44 million  partially offset by a decrease in building repairs and maintenance expense of 25 million  the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other segment was primarily the result of increases in real estate tax expense of 42 million driven by recently completed communities previously in our development pipeline and other operating expense of 30 million 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was 4898 million  a decrease of 39 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a 258 million decrease in amortization expense which was driven by certain intangible assets acquired as a result of the merger with post properties becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of 2017 as a result we recognized no amortization expense for those assets in the year ended december 31 2018  the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by a 219 million increase to depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our capital asset spend during the year ended december 31 2018  which was related to our development and redevelopment activities made in the normal course of business as well as property acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2018  

other income and expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2018  were 476 million  an increase of 40 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2018  were 348 million  a decrease of 54 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to decreases in legal expense merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2018  were 91 million  a decrease of 109 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to declining yearoveryear integration activities related to the merger with post properties 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was 1736 million  an increase of 188 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 18 basis points in our effective interest rate during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  combined with a decrease in interest capitalized from our development pipeline during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  

we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2018  for the year ended december 31 2017  we disposed of five  apartment communities resulting in gains on sale of depreciable real estate assets of 1274 million  gain on sale of nondepreciable assets for the year ended december 31 2018 was 45 million  an increase of 45 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  although we disposed of only one land parcel more in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the gain on sale of nondepreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2018  was 54 million  a decrease of 89 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of 26 million  of expense from the net marktomarket adjustment of the bifurcated embedded derivative related to the maa series i preferred stock during the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the recognition of 88 million  of income from the net marktomarket adjustment of the bifurcated embedded derivative during the year ended december 31 2017  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2016   

for the year ended december 31 2017  we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 3247 million  as compared to 2119 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  total revenue grew 4036 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  representing a 359  increase in property revenues the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the comparison of the year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2016  shows the segment break down based on our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  a comparison using our 2018  same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications 

property revenues 

  

the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



the same store segment generated a 29  increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 30 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in property revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  from our nonsame store and other segment was primarily the result of the merger with post properties as we classified the properties we acquired in the merger in our nonsame store and other segment 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other operating expenses the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of 62 million and personnel expenses of 23 million the increase in property operating expenses for our nonsame store and other segment was primarily due to the merger with post properties 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was 4937 million  an increase of 1708 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily driven by the full year of depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the merger with post properties compared to only one month of comparable depreciation and amortization in 2016 as a result of the merger with post properties depreciation expense and amortization expense increased 1382 million and 232 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the remaining increase was primarily driven by our capital asset spend and other asset acquisition activity 

other income and expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 were 436 million  an increase of 95 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio as a result of the merger with post properties general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 were 402 million  an increase of 112 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to increases in legal expense merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 were 200 million  a decrease of 208 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  as we incurred significant merger related expenses in 2016 to complete the merger with post properties on december 1 2016 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was 1548 million  an increase of 248 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to increased borrowing as we assumed several loans as a result of the merger with post properties including a secured loan with a face value of 1860 million and two unsecured loans with face values of 1500 million and 2500 million respectively we also entered into a new 3000 million term loan on the closing date of the merger with post properties interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 160 million due to these borrowings resulting from the merger with post properties 

gains on sale of depreciable assets totaled 1274 million for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase of 470 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  although disposition activity decreased yearoveryear the gain on sale of depreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2017  was 144 million  an increase of 162 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to an 88 million  increase in income from the net marktomarket adjustment of the bifurcated embedded derivative related to the maa series i preferred stock issued in the merger with post properties the increase in other nonoperating income was also driven by a 33 million net gain on debt extinguishment 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded quarterly dividend distributions to holders of maas series i preferred stock totaling 37 million  as there were no shares of maa series i preferred stock issued and outstanding until completion of the merger with post properties on december 1 2016 preferred dividends only impacted our results of operations for one month totaling 03 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represent net income available for maa common shareholders computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items asset impairment and gains or losses on disposition of operating properties plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures because noncontrolling interest is added back ffo when used in this annual report on form 10k represents ffo attributable to the company 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate trusts or nareits definition it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure dollars in thousands 



ffo for the year ended december 31 2018  were 7127 million  an increase of 131 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of increases in property revenues of 424 million  and gain on sale of nondepreciable assets of 45 million  in addition to a decrease in merger and integration expenses of 109 million  the increases to ffo were offset by increases in interest expense of 188 million  and property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 179 million  in addition to a decrease in other nonoperating income of 89 million  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2017  were 6996 million  an increase of 2362 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of increases in property revenues of 4036 million  and other nonoperating income of 162 million  in addition to a decrease in merger and integration expenses of 208 million  the increases to ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 1534 million  interest expense of 248 million  general and administrative expenses of 112 million  property management expenses of 95 million  and preferred dividends of 34 million  

liquidity and capital resources

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 7343 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 6608 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our operating performance as well as the timing of cash payments

net cash used in financing activities was 4051 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 3995 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the primary drivers of the change were as follows dollars in thousands

1   represents principal payments gross of discounts debt issuance costs and fair market value adjustments of debt assumed 

2   swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

3   interest payments on variable rate debt instruments not subject to interest rate swaps are based on each debt instruments respective interest rate as of december 31 2018  which is assumed to be in effect through the maturity date of the respective debt instrument 

4 primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own and the lease for our corporate headquarters 

we have a commitment which is not reflected in the table above to make additional capital contributions to a limited partnership in which we hold an equity interest the capital contributions may be called by the general partner at any time until september 2022 after giving appropriate notice as of december 31 2018  we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to 136 million if and when called by the general partner of the limited partnership and until september 2022 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had a 350 ownership interest in a limited liability company which owns one apartment community comprised of 269  units located in washington dc we also had a 207  ownership interest in a limited partnership as of december 31 2018  our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not have any relationships including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not 

materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

  

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2018  we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operations 

inflation 

our resident leases at our apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases the majority of our leases are for approximately one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with asu 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements and other and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts on a relative fair value basis in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets management uses stabilized net operating income or noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets management periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated 

undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets no material impairment losses have been recognized during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred therefore repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional detail 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim managements assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings as of december 31 2018  286  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not 

enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes as of december 31 2018  748  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates after considering related derivative instruments we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our interest rate swaps the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and the years in which they expire weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect as of december 31 2018  dollars in thousands 



1  excluding the effect of interest rate swap agreements

1  excludes commercial space located at our multifamily communities which totals approximately 620000 square feet of gross leasable space 

our business is conducted principally through the operating partnership maa is the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 113643166  op units comprising a 964  partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2017  maa and maalp were formed in tennessee in 1993 as of december 31 2017  we had 2419  full time employees and 45  parttime employees 

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

operations 

  

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the income producing capacity of each apartment community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior management and the properties on a realtime basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies and continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a yield management pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

investment in technology continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals via the use of our webbased resident internet portal interacting with our residents through such technology has allowed us to improve resident satisfaction ratings and increase the efficiency of our operating teams 

we report in the following operating segments 



 on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year as well as adjust the previous year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons an apartment community in development or leaseup is added to the same store portfolio on the first day of the calendar year after it has been owned and stabilized for at least a full 12  months communities are considered stabilized after achieving 90  occupancy for 90 days  communities that have been identified for disposition are excluded from the same store portfolio 

  

all properties acquired from post properties in the merger remained in the nonsame store and other operating segment during 2017 as the properties were recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of january 1 2017 for additional information regarding our operating segments see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

acquisitions 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in various large or secondary markets primarily throughout the southeast and southwest regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and asset allocation portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing management and overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of multifamily communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and we will utilize this strategy to increase our number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

we acquired the following apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2017  



dispositions 

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital in deciding to sell an apartment community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets considering the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2017  we disposed of five  multifamily properties totaling 1760 units and four  land parcels totaling approximately 23 acres 

  

development 

  

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we intend to maintain a total development commitment that we consider modest in relation to our total balance sheet and investment portfolio during the year ended december 31 2017  we incurred 1701 million  in development costs and completed 7 development projects 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



redevelopment 

we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep on existing apartment communities across our portfolio that we believe have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2017  we renovated 8375 units at an average cost of 5463 per unit achieving average rental rate increases of 88  above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

  

capital structure 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining access flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturities to avoid disproportionate exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

  

at december 31 2017  275  of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings including 215  under unsecured credit facilities and unsecured senior notes and 60  under secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 32 to 38 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our debt to undepreciated book value of our assets to 60 as of december 31 2017  our ratio of total debt to our adjusted total assets as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by maalp was approximately 332  we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flows from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment 

reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease expiration management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside we also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

  

as a part of our standard apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

merger of maa and post properties 

on december 1 2016 maa completed its merger with post properties pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger or the merger agreement post properties merged with and into maa with maa continuing as the surviving corporation or the parent merger and post lp merged with and into maalp with maalp continuing as the surviving entity or the partnership merger we refer to the parent merger together with the partnership merger as the merger in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated net assets and results of operations of post properties are included in our consolidated financial statements from and after the closing date of the merger the 2016 and 2017 operating results of the post properties assets we acquired in the merger are included in our nonsame store and other operating segment as those assets were not eligible to be included in our same store segments until january 1 2018 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income 

to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2017  maa paid total distributions of 348  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could suffer the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

developments such as an economic downturn instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions although the us real estate market has recently improved certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors including among others political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts high unemployment rates fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits and these factors could contribute to an economic downturn in the us if the us experiences a downturn in the economy instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation government tax increases debt policy or spending restrictions we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity 

financing our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors 

as of december 31 2017  substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 394  of our portfolio is located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas charlotte north carolina and orlando florida in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of our portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance 

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we 

choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and make distributions 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on information technology systems in our operations and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes we maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us including web hosting property management leasing accounting and payroll services the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us we take steps and generally require third party service providers to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers information technology systems including the use of systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information however we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or misconduct this risk of a breach or security failure particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions 

the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed to not be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we and our providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures further in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers information technology systems and the information stored by us or our service providers including personally identifiable information of residents prospective 

residents and employees could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen any failure to prevent a breach or a security failure of our or our service providers information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future apartment community acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies 

we have acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 



may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question including any information reports sent to our shareholders and 

 

property ownership through joint ventures could limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest 

from time to time we may acquire andor develop properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures in that case we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover our partners could have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners could have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners could each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of our partners interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arms length marketing process other potential risks of a jointlyowned property include i a deadlock if we and our partners are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii a limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partners and iii a requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owners or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal 

 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding moldrelated claims from 

standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business which could harm our business and operating results   

we have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes winds floods hurricanes and fires such conditions may damage our properties disrupt our operations and adversely impact our tenants there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties 

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties 

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance premiums should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the fair housing act of 1988 or the fha and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2017  we had three  development communities under construction totaling 937  units we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 



construction resulting in increased costs decreases in revenue and potentially cause us to abandon the opportunity 

 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we may not realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame 

because post properties was a public company we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting post properties public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems these savings are expected to be realized upon full integration integration efforts are ongoing and we may encounter difficulties and delays in the integration process if we are unable to manage and complete the integration of post properties business in an efficient and timely manner we may not achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the merger in the expected time frame or at all likewise there can be no assurance that we will realize other anticipated operating efficiencies and synergies from the merger 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  the amount of our total debt was approximately 45 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

   

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms if at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt and could adversely impact additional debt we may incur in the future 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates accordingly increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock in june 2017 the federal reserve reached a decision to raise the federal funds rate by 025 points with additional gradual increases anticipated to occur over the next year subject to ongoing economic uncertainty in december 2017 the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate by another 025 points to a range of 125 percent to 15 percent these increases in the federal funds rate and any future increases due to other key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria in addition we may fund other of our capital requirements through debt our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may incur more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

at december 31 2017  we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 45 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others and cross default provisions with other material debt in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flows and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain debt financing if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 



 

future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to our common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 867846  of which have been designated as 850 series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2017  867846  shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock 

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a 

percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

the stock markets including the nyse on which maa lists its common stock have at times experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 

   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnerships unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnerships unitholders also maa owns approximately 964  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

t he operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment to service debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of 

maa’s stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which 

there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit 

even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits 

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if post properties or any other reit previously acquired by us failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

prior to the merger post properties operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes if post properties or any other reit previously acquired by maa each a merged reit is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including 

 

maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were investment companies under the investment company rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s business prospects financial condition or results of operations and on maa’s ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a 

corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders above 

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition 

  any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions 

the recently enacted legislation informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act and other legislative regulatory and administrative developments may adversely affect maa or its shareholders 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law pl 11597 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act or the tax act the tax act makes major changes to the code including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their shareholders certain provisions of the tax act that may impact us and our shareholders include 

 

the individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the tax act on maa and its shareholders is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time in addition other legislative regulatory or administrative changes may be enacted or promulgated either prospectively or with retroactive effect and may adversely affect maa or its shareholders maas shareholders and prospective shareholders should consult their individual tax advisors regarding the implications of the tax act and other potential legislative regulatory or administrative changes on their investment in maas capital stock

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 



 

overview 

we experienced an increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2017  as the growth in revenues outpaced increases in our property operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 30  increase in our large market same store segment a 26  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 3752 million  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of the merger the increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to a 20  increase in our large market same store segment a 27  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 1451 million  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily the result of the merger the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

on december 1 2016 we consummated the merger and acquired all of post properties consolidated net assets the consolidated net assets and results of operations of post properties are included in our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the merger going forward all properties acquired from post properties are included in our nonsame store and other operating segment as the properties are recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least twelve months as of january 1 2017 

over the past three years our growth has been driven by our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states as a result of the merger we acquired 61 apartment communities in 2016 we acquired two  apartment communities in 2017  five  in 2016  apart from the merger and seven  in 2015  we disposed of five  apartment communities in 2017  12  in 2016  and 21  in 2015  

trends 

during the year ended december 31 2017  demand for apartments continued to be relatively strong as it was during the year ended december 31 2016  this strength was evident on two fronts occupancy and effective rent per unit same store physical occupancy at december 31 2017  was 97 average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 962 for the year ended december 31 2017  consistent with the year ended december 31 2016  same store average effective rent per unit continued to increase and was up 30 for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  as we move through the remainder of the typically slower winter leasing season and into the typically stronger spring leasing season we believe the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to capture solid pricing in the first half of 2018 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including inner loop suburban and downtowncentral business district locations and various monthly rent price points will perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better through our investment in 37 defined metropolitan statistical areas or msas we are diversified across markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of monthly rent pricing points 

current supply levels are impacting our total portfolio from a demand standpoint particularly properties located in urban submarkets the majority of which were acquired in the merger properties in our same store portfolio have been impacted somewhat less by supply primarily because less new development has occurred in those submarkets encouragingly according to us census bureau data full year 2017 multifamily permitting across our markets was down 5 as compared to the prior year this activity should result in relatively lower supply in our markets in the future as compared to the current environment 

demand for our apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets in particular job growth relative to new supply is a critical factor in our ability to maintain occupancy and increase rents to the extent that the tax cuts and jobs act results in improving economic conditions such as increased job growth or more disposable income we believe that we may be able to maintain occupancy more effectively and increase rents 

also we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties furthermore rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  total move outs attributable to single family home 

rentals for our combined portfolio represented about 6 of total move outs in line with the year ended december 31 2016  we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest regions will continue to support apartment rental demand in our markets 

rising interest rates may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 45 billion  of debt of which 17  had variable rate interest and 83  had fixed or hedged interest rates to the extent interest rates rise our net interest expense on variable rate debt will increase as will potentially our net interest expense on any debt refinancing given the shortterm nature of our leases to the extent interest rates rise due to general economic growth we would expect increases in interest expense to be somewhat offset by positive leasing trends 

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2016   

for the year ended december 31 2017  we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 3247 million  a 532  increase over the prior year and total revenue growth of 4036 million  a 359  increase over the prior year the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2017  

property revenues 

the following table presents our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



the increases in property revenues from our large market same store and secondary market same store portfolio were primarily a result of increased effective rent per unit of 31 and   27 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other portfolio was primarily the result of the merger as we classified the properties we acquired as nonsame store 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment excluding depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



  

the increase in property operating expenses for our large market same store segment was primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of 47 million personnel expenses of 10 million and utilities expense of 07 million partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense of 15 million the increase in property operating expenses for our secondary market same store segment was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes of 15 million personnel expenses of 13 million and utilities expense of 09 million partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense of 03 million the increase in property operating expenses for our nonsame store and other portfolio was primarily due to the merger 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was approximately 4937 million  an increase of 1708 million  from the year ended december 31 2016  in addition to asset acquisitions made in the normal course of business the increase was primarily driven by the full year of depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the merger compared to only one month of comparable depreciation and amortization in 2016 as a result of the merger depreciation expense and amortization expense increased 1382 million and 232 million respectively for year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  

other operating expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  were approximately 436 million  an increase of 95 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio as a result of the merger 

merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  were primarily comprised of 160 million of systems and professional costs and 40 million of legal costs as we integrated post properties into our consolidated operations merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  were approximately 208 million  less than merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  as we incurred significant merger related expenses in 2016 to complete the merger on december 1 2016 

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  were approximately 402 million  an increase of 112 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily driven by legal expenses 

nonoperating expenses and other 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was approximately 1548 million  an increase of 248 million  from the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to increased borrowing as we assumed several loans as a result of the merger including a secured loan with a face value of 1860 million and two unsecured loans with face values of 1500 million and 2500 million respectively we entered into a new 3000 million term loan on the closing date of the merger interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 160 million due to these borrowings resulting from the merger in addition in may 2017 we publicly issued senior unsecured notes with a face value of 6000 million bearing interest at 360 per annum which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 140 million for the year ended december 31 2017  such increases were offset by a slight decreases in interest expense as a result of retirements of secured property mortgages and unsecured notes during the year ended december 31 2017  the notes were scheduled to mature in october 2017 

gains on sale of depreciable assets totaled 1274 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase of approximately 470 million  from the year ended december 31 2016  although disposition activity decreased yearoveryear the gain on sale of depreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold 

other nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2017  was 144 million  an increase of approximately 162 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to an 88 million  increase in the net marktomarket adjustments of the bifurcated embedded derivative related to the maa series i preferred stock issued in the merger the yearoveryear increase was also driven by the 33 million  increase in the net gain on debt extinguishment primarily due to gains of 48 million from the writeoffs of marktomarket debt adjustments related to the retirement of secured mortgages and a term loan partially offset by a cash prepayment penalty of 16 million 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded quarterly dividend distributions to holders of maas series i preferred stock totaling 37 million  as there were no shares of maa series i preferred stock issued and outstanding until completion of the merger on december 1 2016 preferred dividends only impacted our results of operations for one month totaling 03 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2016  to the year ended december 31 2015   

for the year ended december 31 2016  we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of 2119 million  a 362  decrease over the prior year and total revenue growth of 826 million  a 79  increase over the prior year 

the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the decrease in net income for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2016  

  

the comparison of the year ended december 31 2016  to the year ended december 31 2015  shows the segment break down based on the 2016  same store portfolios a comparison using the 2017  same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications

the following table presents our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio was primarily a result of increased effective rent per unit of 49 and 29 for our large and secondary markets respectively the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other segment was due to the merger 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization the following table reflects our property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store segment was primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of 53 million personnel expenses of 15 million and utilities expenses of 12 million the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store segment was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes of 13 million    the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other segment was due to the merger 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was 3230 million  an increase of 284 million from the year ended december 31 2015  the increase was primarily driven by depreciation expense of 174 million related to the merger additionally the amortization of the fair market value of inplace leases related to the merger began in december 2016 and totaled 49 million for the year ended december 31 2016  

other operating expenses 

merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  were 408 million  as a result of the expenses associated with the merger which closed on december 1 2016 there were no merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  as no merger occurred in that year 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was approximately 1299 million  an increase of 76 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  the increase was due in part to decreased amortization of the fair market value of 

debt adjustments related to debt acquired and increased interest rates towards the end of 2016 additionally we assumed additional debt as a result of the merger including a secured loan in the principal amount of 1860 million and two series of unsecured senior notes with face values of 1500 million and 2500 million respectively additionally we entered into a new 3000 million term loan on the closing date of the merger 

we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets of 804 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  a decrease of approximately 1096 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in disposition activity yearoveryear dispositions decreased from 21  multifamily properties for the year ended december 31 2015  to 12  multifamily properties for the year ended december 31 2016  

nonoperating expenses and other 

other nonoperating expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was 18 million  a decrease of approximately 44 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to the 35 million  decrease in loss on debt extinguishment due to the 2015 removal of properties from a secured taxfree debt facility there was an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment activity for the year ended december 31 2016  

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income available for maa common shareholders computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items asset impairment and gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis because noncontrolling interest is added back ffo when used in this annual report on form 10k represents ffo attributable to the company 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with nareits definition it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the closest corresponding gaap measure dollars in thousands 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2017  increased by approximately 2362 million  from the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of the increases in property revenues of 4036 million  and other nonoperating income of 162 million  in addition to decreased merger and integration expenses of 208 million  the increases to ffo were offset by the impact of increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 1534 million  interest expense of 248 million  general and administrative expenses of 112 million  property management expenses of 95 million  and preferred dividends of 34 million  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2016  increased by approximately 110 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of 826 million  which was offset by increases in merger and integration expenses of 408 million  property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of 227 million  general and administrative expenses of 33 million  and property management expenses of 31 million  

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 6585 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 4840 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of operating results of post properties for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to one month of operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2017  was 2834 million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  of 7105 million  the primary drivers of the change were as follows 

the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets resulted from the acquisition of two  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the acquisition of five  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements development and other during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the prior year resulted from the property portfolio increase and development pipeline increase as a result of the merger the decrease in proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of five  apartment communities and four  land parcels during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the sale of 12  apartment communities one  commercial property and three  land parcels during the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of three anticipated future 1031b transactions offset by the release of three 1031b transactions that never occurred during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the funding of one anticipated future 1031b transaction during the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease in cash outflows for the acquisition of post properties net of cash acquired compared to prior year resulted from the completion of the merger there were no mergers during the year ended december 31 2017  

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 3979 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2224 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the primary drivers of the change were as follows 



the decrease in cash outflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of 800 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility and 800 million on our secured credit facility during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to an increase in net borrowings of 4150 million on the unsecured revolving credit facility and a decrease of 800 million on the secured credit facility during the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in proceeds from notes payable during the year ended   december 31 2017   related to the may 2017 issuance of 6000 million senior unsecured notes as discussed in note 6 compared to the 2016 issuance of the unsecured term loan in the amount of 3000 million the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from paying off approximately 2336 million of secured property mortgages and 1680 million of senior unsecured notes during the year ended   december 31 2017   compared to paying off the 1400 million legacy post properties line of credit facility during the year ended   december 31 2016  the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increased number of common shares outstanding as a result of the merger and the increase in the annual dividend rate to   348   per share during the year ended   december 31 2017   compared to the dividend rate of   328   per share during the year ended   december 31 2016    

equity 

as of december 31 2017  maa owned 113643166  op units comprising a 964  limited partnership interest in the operating partnership while the remaining 4191586  outstanding op units were held by third party limited partners of the operating partnership holders of op units other than maa and its corporate affiliates may require us to redeem their op units from time to time in which case maa may at its option pay the redemption price either in cash in an amount per op unit equal in general to the average closing price of maas common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date or by delivering one share of maas common stock subject to adjustment under specified circumstances for each op unit so redeemed in addition maa has registered under the securities act the 4191586  shares of its common stock that as of december 31 2017  were issuable upon redemption of op units so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets

senior unsecured notes 

we have also issued both public and private unsecured notes as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 20 billion face value of publicly issued notes and 2920 million of unsecured notes issued in two private placements in october 2013 we publicly issued 3500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 with a coupon of 430 paid semiannually on april 15 and october 15 in june 2014 we publicly issued 4000 million of senior unsecured notes due 2024 with a coupon of 375 paid semiannually on june 15 and december 15 in november 2015 we publicly issued 4000 million senior unsecured notes due 2025 with a coupon of 400 paid semiannually on may 15 and november 15 as a result of the merger in december 2016 we assumed two series of publicly issued senior notes totaling 4000 million one series of senior notes assumed as a result of the merger has a face value of 2500 million is due 2022 and has a coupon of 338 paid semiannually on june 1 and december 1 the other series of senior notes assumed as a result of the merger had a face value of 1500 million and was due in october 2017 but was paid off in july 2017 in may 2017 we publicly issued 6000 million of senior unsecured notes due june 1 2027 with a coupon of 360 paid semiannually on june 1 and december 1 the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in may 2017 were used to pay down outstanding amounts of the key bank facility as of december 31 2017  all of these amounts with the exception of the series of senior unsecured notes assumed in the merger with a face value of 1500 million that was paid off in july 2017 remained outstanding

3 swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

5 primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own 

we have a commitment which is not reflected in the table above to make additional capital contributions to a limited partnership in which we hold an equity interest the capital contributions may be called by the general partner at any time until september 2022 after giving appropriate notice at december 31 2017  we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to 135 million if and when called by the general partner of the limited partnership and prior to september 2022 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not have any relationships including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

as of december 31 2017  we had a 350 ownership interest in a limited liability company which owns one apartment community comprised of 269  units located in washington dc we also had a 310  ownership interest in a limited partnership our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the investments as we do not have a controlling interest 

in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

  

we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1 2017  we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

our resident leases at our apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with asu 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business which requires the cost of the of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements and other and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts on a relative fair value basis in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets management uses stabilized net operating income or noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset we calculate the fair value of an asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate we estimate the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets no material impairment losses have been recognized 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred therefore repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional detail 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any 

for more information regarding our significant accounting policies including a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our financial statements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings at december 31 2017  275  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix or cap the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes at december 31 2017  approximately 830  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our interest rate swaps and cap the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and cap and the years in which they expire weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date dollars in thousands

reporting segments 

  

as of december 31 2016  we owned 302 multifamily apartment communities located in 16  states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows additionally we had full ownership of four  commercial properties in three  states senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments 

 

on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year as well as adjust the previous year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons for financial reporting purposes the operating results of the post properties assets that we acquired in the merger are within the nonsame store communities and other reporting segment the legacy post properties assets will not be eligible to be included in same store segments until january 1 2018 properties in development or leaseup will generally be added to the same store portfolio on the first day of the calendar year after they have been owned and stabilized for at least a full 12 months communities are considered stabilized after achieving 90 occupancy for 90 days communities that have been identified for disposition are excluded from our same store portfolio 

during 2016 we added 12 communities to our same store portfolio and moved 13 communities to our nonsame store and other segment in addition as a result of the merger we added 58 whollyowned apartment communities to our nonsame store and other segment 

  

a summary of segment operating results for 2016  2015  and 2014  is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 additionally segment operating performance for such years is discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

  

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

2016 highlights 



 

operations strategy 

  

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the income producing capacity of each community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

advances in technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since october 2012 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in february 2013 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartments 

acquisition strategy 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in large or secondary markets primarily throughout the southeast and southwest regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions as discussed below help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and asset allocation portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing management and overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of multifamily communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

the following apartment communities and land parcels in addition to the 61 properties encompassing 20818 units along with 6 land parcels acquired through the merger were acquired by us during the year ended december 31 2016  





disposition strategy 

  

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital when we decide to sell a community we consider current market conditions and generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2016  we disposed of 12  multifamily properties totaling 3263  units two commercial properties totaling 325418 square feet and four land parcels totaling 67 acres 

  

development strategy 

  

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties fixed price construction contracts are signed with unrelated parties to minimize construction risk we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we intend to maintain a total development commitment that we consider modest in relation to our total balance sheet and investment portfolio during the year ended december 31 2016  we incurred 589 million  in development costs 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



redevelopment strategy 

in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2016  we renovated 6812 units and exterior amenities at an average cost of 4478 per unit we believe that the rents received on these renovated units were approximately 98   above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

  

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business strategy we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining access flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we structure our debt maturity schedule to avoid significant exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

  

at december 31 2016  281  of our total market capitalization consisted of borrowings including 198  under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes and 82  under our secured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 32 to 38 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our debt to undepreciated book value of our assets to 60 as of december 31 2016  our ratio of total debt to total assets was approximately 339 

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by these markets we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flows from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments 

  

on december 9 2015 we entered into distribution agreements with jp morgan securities llc bmo capital markets corp and keybanc capital markets inc to sell up to an aggregate of 40 million shares of common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms as of december 31 2016  there were 40 million shares remaining under the atms 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these types of atm agreements from january 1 2012 through december 31 2016  



we also have a dividend and distribution reinvestment stock purchase plan or drspp which allows for the optional cash purchase of shares of common stock totaling at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2016  we issued a total of 1579  shares through the optional cash purchase feature of the drspp resulting in net proceeds of 152463  

share repurchase program 

  

on december 8 2015 maas board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 40 million shares of maa common stock which represented approximately 53 of maas common stock outstanding at the time of such authorization this december 2015 authorization replaced and superseded a previous authorization from 1999 under which approximately 21 million shares remained at the time of the december 2015 authorization but through which no shares had been repurchased since april 2001 from timetotime we may repurchase shares under the current authorization when we believe that shareholder value would be enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price and expected rates of return no shares were repurchased from december 8 2015 through december 31 2016 under the current authorization 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside we also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

  

environmental matters 

  

as a normal part of our apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms as part of the due diligence process for the merger we reviewed the existing environmental studies and other related documents outlining potential risk on the properties acquired through the merger the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2016  maa paid total distributions of 328  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartments although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

recent developments 

on february 7 2017 we paid off the 158 million remaining principal balance of the mortgage on the grand cypress apartment community 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to the post properties merger 

we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger 

we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and integrating post properties’ business operations networks systems technologies policies and procedures with ours there are a large number of systems that are in the process of being integrated including property management revenue management resident payment credit screening lease administration website content management purchasing accounting payroll fixed assets and financial reporting moreover there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these integration expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time as a result expenses associated with the merger could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses 

we may be unable to integrate post properties businesses with ours successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame 

because post properties was a public company we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting post properties public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems these savings are expected to be realized upon full integration which is expected to occur during the next 12 months however we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of post properties with our business practices and operations potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

for all these reasons you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the combined corporation’s management the disruption of the combined corporation’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in the combined corporation’s operations services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect the ability of the combined corporation to maintain relationships with tenants vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined corporation 

we may be unable to retain key employees as a result of the merger 

the success of the combined corporation after the mergers will depend in part upon its ability to retain key maa employees including those from post properties key employees of the combined corporation may depart because of among other things issues relating to the combination of two companies and uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to 

remain long term with the combined corporation accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past 

the mergers will result in changes to the board of directors and management of the combined corporation that may affect the strategy of the combined corporation as compared to that of maa and post properties independently 

the composition of maas board of directors changed as a result of the merger maa’s board of directors now consists of thirteen members including all ten directors from maa’s board of directors prior to the merger and three directors who were members of the post properties’ board of directors prior to the merger this new composition of the board of directors of maa may affect our business strategy and operating decisions going forward 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of its operations following the merger 

we have expanded our operations as a result of the merger and intend to continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions and development of properties some of which may involve complex challenges our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage the integration of post properties’ operations and our expansion opportunities each of which may pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner and upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations costs regulatory compliance and service quality and to maintain other necessary internal controls there is no assurance that our expansion or acquisition and development opportunities will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements synergies or other benefits from any future acquisitions we may complete 

our joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on our joint venture partner’s financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partner 

post properties had a joint venture investment that now constitutes a portion of our assets as a result of the merger in addition we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future these joint venture investments involve risks not present with a property wholly owned by us including that i one or more joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund a share of required capital contributions and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses ii one or more joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals creating a conflict of interest or iii disputes between us and one or more of our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our operating expenses of and divert management time and attention away from our business 

the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could cause unanticipated disruption to our operations or unanticipated costs and liabilities to us which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future 

we have substantial indebtedness following completion of the merger in addition in connection with executing our business strategies following the merger we expect to continue to evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional properties and making strategic investments and we may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness the amount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for us including 

 

moreover to respond to competitive challenges we may be required to raise substantial additional capital to execute our business strategy our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control if we are able to obtain additional 

financing our credit ratings could be further adversely affected which could further raise our borrowing costs and further limit our future access to capital and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

developments such as another economic downturn instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions although the us real estate market has recently improved certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors including among others political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts high unemployment rates fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits and these factors could contribute to another economic downturn in the us if the us experience another downturn in the economy instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation government tax increases debt policy or spending restrictions we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors 

as of december 31 2016 substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 397 of our portfolio is located in our top five markets atlanta georgia dallas texas austin texas charlotte north carolina and tampa florida in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of the portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 

failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance 

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

breaches of our privacy or information security systems through cyberattacks cyberintrusions or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

we face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or malfeasance the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyberterrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased    the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems is critically important to us our business requires us and our service providers including service providers engaged in providing web hosting property management leasing accounting andor payroll softwareservices to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees which may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business 

  

we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems however the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk further in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems and the information stored by us could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information we could be materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation possible liability and remediation costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation and adversely affect investor confidence 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies 

we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 



we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to remediate properly hazardous toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal 



 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties 

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties 

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in rental rates our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions and senior debt could be affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2016 we had nine development communities under construction totaling 2816 units we had completed 700 units for these development projects as of december 31 2016 we may make further investments in development communities as the opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 



initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations 

 

we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations 

the trump administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to financial regulation reform tax reform infrastructure spending climate change executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress including the repeal of or additional amendments to the doddfrank act may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the possibility of repeal or amendments to the doddfrank act have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  the amount of our total debt was approximately 450 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

   

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates accordingly increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 

additionally on december 14 2016 the federal reserve reached a decision to raise the federal funds rate by 025 points with additional gradual increases anticipated to occur over the next year subject to ongoing economic uncertainty this increase in the federal funds rate and any future increases due to other key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that 

we may incur and we may issue more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

at december 31 2016  we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 450 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets and cross default provisions with other material debt among others in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt   

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 



 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

 

future offerings of debt or equity securities which may rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future which would rank senior to our common stock it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility additionally any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of its future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared and standing practice changed at the discretion of the board of directors the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock 868000 of which have been designated as maa series i preferred stock in addition to the maa series i preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock including the maa series i preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2016  approximately 868000 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock 

  

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

  

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas stock 

  

the stock markets including nyse on which maa lists its common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 



   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnerships unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnerships unitholders also maa owns approximately 964  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

t he operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders maa’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of 

maa’s stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit maa cannot assure you however that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit 

even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to various federal state and local taxes including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable incomes without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits 

furthermore we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we or the subsidiary reit could qualify for certain relief provisions the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction on an annual or quarterly basis of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year 

if colonial or post properties’ failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we would incur adverse tax consequences and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

prior to their respective mergers with maa each of colonial and post properties operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes if either colonial or post properties each a “merged reit” is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences including 

 

maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 10 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger in addition unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year then the merged reit would not have been entitled to reelect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified furthermore if both maa and a merged reit were “investment companies” under the “investment company” rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes as a result of all these factors the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa’s qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa’s additional tax liabilities and therefore could have a material adverse effect on maa’s financial condition results of operations business and prospects and on maa’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness or distributions to its shareholders 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above 

certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a 100 penalty tax on gain attributable to the disposition 

  any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction as such the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100 tax is available however we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions 

recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 

the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “path act” changed certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the path act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the path act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the path act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the path 

act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the path act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in september 2010 the united states department of justice the “doj” filed suit against post properties and by virtue of the merger maa in united states distric court for the district of columbia alleging that certain of maa’s apartments violated accessibility requirements of the fair housing act the “fha” and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” the doj is seeking among other things an injunction against maa requiring maa to retrofit the properties and comply with fha and ada standards in future design and construction as well as monetary damages and civil penalties no trial date has been set and no significant settlement negotiations with the doj have occurred 

in addition maa is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business operations matters which arise out of allegations of bodily injury property damage and employment practices are generally covered by insurance while the resolution of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty management currently believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on maa’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 964  limited partner interest as of december 31 2016  maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership’s various subsidiaries this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets management uses stabilized net operating income noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets although managements estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation if any would be made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors if impairment indicators exist for a longlived asset management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset if impairment indicators exist for goodwill management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets no impairment losses have been recognized during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

  

cost capitalization 

repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development 

projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable then we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involves a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any

overview of the year ended december 31 2016   

as noted earlier on december 1 2016 we consummated the merger and acquired all of post properties net assets as a result of the merger the results of operations for 2016 include 12 months of results for maa and one month of results for post properties our december 31 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of maa and post properties all properties acquired from post properties have been placed in our nonsame store and other operating segment as the properties are recent acquisitions and have not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months 

we experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations in 2016  despite increases in revenues outpacing increases in property operating expenses due to lower gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets and increased merger and integration costs the increases in revenues came from a 49  increase in our large market same store segment a 31  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 417  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of the merger the increase in property operating expenses came from a 32  increase in our large market same store segment a 20  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 307  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily the result of the merger our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified for disposition additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note 16  segment information the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states apart from the merger we acquired four  apartment communities for our portfolio in 2014  seven  in 2015  and five  in 2016  offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were four  apartment community dispositions in 2014  twentyone  in 2015  and twelve  in 2016  

the following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



1  includes units owned by nonconsolidated joint venture 

average effective monthly rent per unit is calculated as the average of monthly gross rent amounts for occupied units after the effect of leasing concessions plus thenprevailing market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing however it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit for additional discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons see the “trends” section below 

results of operations 

as a result of the merger the results of operations for 2016 include twelve months of results for maa and one month of results for post properties our december 31 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of maa and post properties

property revenues 

the following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased effective rental revenue per occupied unit of 49 and 29 for our large and secondary markets respectively the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other portfolio is primarily the result of the merger which we classified as nonsame store see discussion of our segment classification methodology at note 16 segment information

the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of 53 million personnel expenses of 15 million and utilities expenses of 12 million the increase in our large market same store operating expenses was slightly offset by a decrease in insurance expense of 05 million the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of 13 million personnel expenses of 06 million and utilities expenses of 05 million the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other portfolio is primarily the result of the merger which we classified as nonsame store see discussion of our segment classification methodology at note 16 segment information 

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  dollars in thousands 



the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 284 million  is primarily driven by depreciation expense of 174 million related to the merger additionally the amortization of fair market value of inplace leases began in december of 2016 totaling 49 million for the year ended december 31 2016  

merger and integration costs 

merger related expenses for the acquisition of post properties were approximately 390 million for the year ended december 31 2016  we also incurred integration related expenses of approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2016  these expenses primarily consisted of legal management salaries and professional fees there were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  because no merger occurred in that year and the expenses associated with our merger with colonial properties trust or colonial had already been incurred 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was approximately 1299 million  an increase of 76 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  the increase was due in part to decreased amortization of fair market value of debt adjustments related to debt acquired and increased interest rates towards the end of 2016 additionally we assumed several 

loans through the acquisition of post properties including a secured loan with a face value of 1860 million and two unsecured loans with face values of 1500 million and 2500 million

loss on debt extinguishment was approximately 83000  for the year ended december 31 2016  for the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded a loss of 36 million  the decrease of 35 million  was due primarily to the removal of properties from a secured taxfree debt facility for the year ended december 31 2015  with the exception of an 83000  gain on extinguishment offset by a 166000 loss for the writeoff of deferred financing costs and related fees there was no activity for the year ended december 31 2016

preferred dividends distributed 

as a result of the merger for the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded a dividend distribution to shareholders of preferred stock of 307000  as there were no maa series i preferred shares issued and outstanding as of the year ended december 31 2015 we did not record a dividend distribution

the comparison of the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2014 shows the segment break down based on the 2015  same store portfolios a comparison using the 2016  same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications 

property revenues 

  

the following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  dollars in thousands

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  dollars in thousands

property management expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  were approximately 310 million  a decrease of 11 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  the majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of 21 million partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of 06 million an increase in payroll expense of 03 million and an increase in incentive expense 03 million 

general and administrative expenses

we recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of 60 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease was primarily a result of recording a 34 million gain for the disposition of ansley village by midamerica multifamily fund ii or fund ii as well as a 28 million gain for the promote fee received from our fund ii partner during 2014 the promote fee was received as a result of maa achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the fund ii properties over the life of the joint venture there were no such gains recorded during the year ended december 31 2015  

discontinued operations 

we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of 54 million   for the year ended december 31 2014  we did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31 2015  due the adoption of asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2015  was approximately 185 million  an increase of 102 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  this increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items net income attributable to noncontrolling interest asset impairment gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis disposition of real estate assets includes but is not limited to sales of discontinued operations 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

core ffo a nongaap financial measure represents ffo excluding certain noncash or nonroutine items such as acquisition merger and integration expenses marktomarket debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance 

the following table is a reconciliation of core ffo and ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  dollars in thousands 



1  gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities excludes the promote fee recognized with the final liquidation of midamerica multifamily fund ii fund ii 

2  the loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31 2014  includes maas share of debt extinguishment costs incurred by our joint venture fund ii 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2016  increased by approximately 110 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of 826 million  which was offset by increases in merger and integration related expenses of 408 million  property operating expenses excluding depreciation of 227 million  property management expenses of 31 million  and general and administrative expenses of 33 million  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2015  increased by approximately 483 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of 506 million  and a decrease in merger and integration related expenses of 115 million  which were partially offset by increases of 73 million  in property operating expenses and 48 million  in general and administrative expenses 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2016  increased by approximately 517 million  from the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 826 million  which was offset by increases in property operating expenses excluding depreciation of 227 million  property management expenses of 31 million  and general and administrative expenses of 33 million  

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2015  increased by approximately 429 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 506 million  and the decrease in interest expense excluding the marktomarket debt adjustment of 67 million which was partially offset by the 73 million  increase in property operating expenses and the 48 million  in general and administrative expenses 

trends 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2016 demand for apartments was strong as it was during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 this strength was evident on two fronts occupancy and effective rent per unit same store physical occupancy ended december 2016 at a 966 and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 962 for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 up 15 basis points from the twelve months ended december 31 2015 same store average effective rent per unit continued to grow up 42 in the twelve months ended december 31 2016 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2015 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a diversity of markets submarkets product types and price points across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a wellbalanced portfolio including both large and select secondary markets inner loop suburban and downtowncbd locations and various monthly rent price points will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better as of december 31 2016 including the impact of the merger we were invested in approximately 39 defined msas diversified across both large markets and secondary markets urban and suburban submarkets and a variety of monthly rent pricing points 

according to us census bureau data as of november 30 2016 multifamily permitting was down over 7 as compared to november 30 2015 while we believe a return to historical permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply we also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years the current downward trend of multifamily permitting and the demand from new households will help keep supply and demand essentially in balance in most markets also we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties furthermore rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 total move outs attributable to single family home rentals dropped to 7 of total move outs as compared to 8 of total move outs for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to support apartment rental demand for our markets 

our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system as noted above physical occupancy ended december 2016 strong and the average for the twelve months ended december 2016 was 15 basis points above the level we achieved in the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as we move through the remainder of the typically slower winter leasing season and into the typically stronger spring leasing season the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to capture solid pricing in the first half of 2017 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues benefits of improved practices such as monthly and intramonthly lease expiration management and collections performance enable us to capture increased revenue we continue to actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses furthermore the merger provides further opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and to combine best practices across the entire portfolio 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31 2015  to the year ended december 31 2016  due to operating investing and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities 

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 4840 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 4637 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  this change was a result of various items including higher revenues as discussed above 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 7105 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 1362 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the increase in cash outflows during the year ended december 31 2016  primarily resulted in cash proceeds net of cash acquired of 4278 million being used to satisfy post properties debt at the time of the merger and included as consideration provided for the merger the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the cost of the acquisition of five  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the cost of the acquisition of seven  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of twelve  apartment communities one  commercial property and three land parcels during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the sale of twentyone apartment communities one commercial property and one land parcel during the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of one anticipated future1031b transactions into escrow during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the funding of two 1031b transactions during and corresponding return to cash from escrow for those transactions during the year ended december 31 2015  the increase in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending during the year ended december 31 2016  

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities increased to 2224 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 3166 million  used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the increase in cash inflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the increase in borrowings of 3350 million on the keybank facility as defined below during 2016 which included 1400 million used   to pay off post properties line of credit facility compared to the   net decrease of 1801 million due to net repayments in 2015 of 1058 million on our fannie mae secured credit facility and 911 million on our tax free secured property facility which were partially offset by net increases on our keybank facility of 160 million the decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we issued 400 million in unsecured bonds compared to proceeds of 300 million related to the issuance of the wells fargo term loan received in 2016 the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to 082 per share during the year ended december 31 2016 from 077 per share during the year ended december 31 2015   

equity 

as of december 31 2016  maa owned 113518212  op units comprising a 964  limited partnership interest in the operating partnership while the remaining 4220403  outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership holders of op units other than maa and its corporate affiliates may require us to redeem their op units from time to time in which case we may at our option pay the redemption price either in cash in an amount per op unit equal in general to the average closing price of maas common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date or by delivering one share of our common stock subject to adjustment under specified circumstances for each op unit so redeemed in addition we have registered under the securities act the 4220403  shares of our common stock which as of december 31 2016  were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnerships limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets if maa issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of op units in the operating partnership sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for maa common stock or may impair maas ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities 

in connection with the merger we issued to the thenholders of post properties capital stock and op units approximately 380 million shares of maa common stock approximately 80000 op units and approximately 868000 maa series i preferred stock on december 1 2016

insurance 

we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1 2016  we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

our resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

2015 highlights 

 

operations strategy 

  

our goal is to generate return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting in the protection and income producing capacity of each community as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are 

proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visits to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

advances in technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in october 2012 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in february 2013 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartments 

in 2015 our website exceeded 44 million site visitors which translates into an 22 yearoveryear increase we attribute this increase to the third quarter website redesign extensive search engine optimization efforts and new mobile responsive capabilities in the fourth quarter of 2015 we had over one million site visits to our website from mobile devices an increase of 89 versus the fourth quarter of the prior year 

  

acquisition strategy 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in large or secondary markets primarily throughout the southeast and southwest regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions as discussed below help us achieve and maintain our desired product mix geographic diversification and rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of multifamily communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

the following apartment communities and land parcels were acquired by us during the year ended december 31 2015  





disposition strategy 

  

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to acquire develop and redevelop additional apartment communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2015  we disposed of 21 multifamily properties totaling 5105  units and one  commercial property totaling 67735 square feet 

  

development strategy 

  

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects typically our agreements are structured to minimize the construction and development risk by contracting with unrelated parties to do the work through a fixed price contract cost overruns generally are covered by the developer or shared on a predetermined contractual basis we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we typically serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties during the year ended december 31 2015  we incurred 387 million  in development costs 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2015  dollars in thousands 



redevelopment strategy 

in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have the ability to support additional rent growth during the year ended december 31 2015  we renovated 5781  units and exterior amenities for a total of 310 million  we believe that the rents received on these renovated units were approximately 101   above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

  

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business strategy we maintain a capital structure focused on maintaining flexibility and low costs that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to avoid significant exposure in any given year our primary debt financing strategy is to access the unsecured debt markets to provide our debt capital needs but we also maintain a limited amount of secured debt and maintain our access to both the secured and unsecured debt markets for maximum flexibility we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

  

at december 31 2015  322  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings including 121  under our secured borrowings and 201  under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes we currently intend to target our total debt net of cash held to a range of approximately 38 to 42 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants for our unsecured senior notes limit our debt to undepreciated book value of our assets to 60 as of december 31 2015  our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value of our assets was approximately 411 

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing our shareholder value per share we plan to continue using unsecured debt in order to take advantage of the lower cost of capital and flexibility provided by the public bond market we will evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we focus on improving the net present value of our investments by generating cash flows from our portfolio of assets above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value over the life of the investments 

  

on december 9 2015 we entered into distribution agreements with jp morgan securities llc bmo capital markets corp and keybanc capital markets inc to sell up to an aggregate of 40 million shares of common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms as of december 31 2015  there were 40 million shares remaining under the atms 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these types of atm agreements through december 31 2015  



we also have a dividend and distribution reinvestment stock purchase plan or drspp which allows for the optional cash purchase of shares of common stock totaling at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2015  we issued a total of 1622  shares through the optional cash purchase feature of the drspp resulting in net proceeds of 128687  

share repurchase program 

  

in 1999 maas board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized to be repurchased to 40 million shares as of december 8 2015 maa had repurchased a total of approximately 19 million shares which represented approximately 8 of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the beginning of such authorization on december 8 2015 maas board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 40 million shares of maa common stock which represented approximately 53 of maas common stock outstanding at the time of such authorization this december 2015 authorization replaced and superseded the 1999 authorization under which approximately 21 million shares remained at the time of the december 2015 authorization from timetotime we may repurchase shares under the current authorization when we believe that shareholder value would be enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price and expected rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through december 8 2015 under the prior authorization and no shares were repurchased from december 8 2015 through december 31 2015 under the current authorization 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe however that we are generally wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside we also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual units on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

  

merger of maa and colonial 

on october 1 2013 maa completed its previously announced merger with colonial properties trust or colonial pursuant to the merger agreement martha merger sub lp or op merger sub a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the operating partnership merged with and into colonial realty limited partnership which we refer to as colonial lp with colonial lp being the surviving entity of the merger and becoming a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the operating partnership which is referred to as the partnership merger the partnership merger was part of the transactions contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger entered into on june 3 2013 among maa the operating partnership op merger sub colonial and colonial lp pursuant to which maa and colonial also combined through a merger of colonial with and into maa with maa surviving the merger which is referred to as the parent merger we refer to the parent merger together with the partnership merger as the merger in this annual report on form 10k under the terms of the merger agreement each common share of beneficial interest in colonial or colonial common share was converted into the right to receive 036 of a 

newly issued share of maa common stock in addition each limited partner interest in colonial lp designated as a “class a unit” and a “partnership unit” under the limited partnership agreement of colonial lp which we refer to in this report as colonial lp units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the partnership merger was converted into common units in our operating partnership at the 036 conversion rate 

the consolidated net assets and results of operations of colonial are included in our consolidated financial statements from and after the closing date october 1 2013 

environmental matters 

  

as a normal part of our apartment community acquisition and development processes we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development property however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2015  maa paid total distributions of 308  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement and was in excess of reit taxable income 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartments although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

recent developments 

on february 1 2016 we paid off the 135 million remaining principal balance of the mortgage on the colonial village at matthews apartment community 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

developments such as another economic downturn instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions although the us real estate market has recently improved certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors including among others political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts high unemployment rates fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits and these factors could contribute to another economic downturn in the us if the us experience another downturn in the economy instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation government tax increases debt policy or spending restrictions we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders 

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

 13 

 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors 

as of december 31 2015 substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector as a result we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had further diversified our investments 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 342 of our portfolio is located in our top five markets atlanta georgia austin texas charlotte north carolina raleighdurham north carolina and dallas texas in addition our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of the portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 

failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance 

we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures in addition we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may as a result fail to recover expenses already incurred 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

breaches of our privacy or information security systems through cyberattacks cyberintrusions or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

we face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions which could result from among other incidents cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses or employee error or malfeasance the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattacks or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyberterrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased    the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems is critically important to us our business requires us and our service providers including service providers engaged in providing web hosting property management leasing accounting andor payroll softwareservices to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees which may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business 

  

we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems however the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk further in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems and the information stored by us could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information we could be materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation possible liability and remediation costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation and adversely affect investor confidence 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies 

we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 15 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility 

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to remediate properly hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal 

 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties 

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties 

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance should rise without being offset by a corresponding increase in rental rates our results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions and senior debt could be affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2015 we had five development communities under construction totaling 748 units we had completed 37 units for these development projects as of december 31 2015 our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

we may be unable to retain key employees 

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain our key employees there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect us 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  the amount of our total debt was approximately 343 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

 

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that indebtedness on our communities or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates accordingly increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 

we may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely impact our financial condition 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and we may issue more debt in the future accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

at december 31 2015  we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 343 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt maintenance of unencumbered asset value and total debt to gross assets among others in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

a change in united states government policy with regard to fannie mae and freddie mac could impact our financial condition 

  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the united states we utilize loan programs sponsored by these entities as one source of capital to finance our growth and our operations there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac which could result in these agencies having their mandates changed or reduced losing key personnel being disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinuing to provide liquidity for the multifamily sector we do not know when or if fannie mae or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2015  7  of our outstanding debt was borrowed through a credit facility provided by or creditenhanced by fannie mae with agency ratebased maturities ranging from 2016 through 2018  in 2015  we decreased the indebtedness outstanding on our fannie mae credit facilities from 4369 million  on december 31 2014  to 2400 million  a decision by the us government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect us and our growth and operations 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt   

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2015  no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes 

may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock 

  

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

  

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas stock 

  

the stock markets including nyse on which maa lists its common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 

   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnerships unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnerships unitholders also maa owns approximately 948  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

t he operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions it would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which maa loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders furthermore maa would no longer be required to make distributions to its shareholders thus maa’s failure to qualify as a reit could also impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of its common stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit however maa cannot assure you that it is qualified as a reit or that maa will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if maa qualifies as a reit maa will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that maa does not distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable incomes without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits 

we may incur adverse tax consequences if colonial failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and if that occurs it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition   

prior to the merger colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code as discussed in exhibit 991 to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on march 19 2015 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and colonial’s qualification as a reit prior to the merger was generally subject to the same requirements risks and uncertainties as described in such exhibit 991 moreover the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership such as we do and colonial did prior to the merger the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a reit’s control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit 

if colonial is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to the merger maa will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities because maa owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the operating partnership the operating partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to maa to satisfy any such tax liabilities which would substantially reduce the operating partnership’s available cash including cash available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or maas shareholders because among other things 

 

maa is liable for any taxes payable by colonial for any periods prior to the merger in addition if colonial failed to qualify as a reit but we nonetheless qualified as a reit in the event of a taxable disposition of a former colonial asset during 

the five years following the merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the merger in addition under the “investment company” rules under section 368 of the code if both maa and colonial were “investment companies” under such rules the failure of either colonial or us to have qualified as a reit could cause the merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders as a result of all these factors colonial’s failure to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize our qualification as a reit and require our operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above 

recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 

the recently enacted protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “path act” contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the path act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the path act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the path act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the path act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the path act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the path act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 948  limited partner interest as of december 31 2015  maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership’s various subsidiaries this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets management divides forecasted net operating income noi by a market capitalization rate management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets although managements estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation if any would be made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors if impairment indicators exist for a longlived asset management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset if impairment indicators exist for goodwill management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets historically impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

  

cost capitalization 

repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable the we do not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involve a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any

overview of the year ended december 31 2015   

we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2015  as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses the increases in revenues came from a 63  increase in our large market same store segment a 47  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 10  increase in our nonsame store and other segment the increase in expense came from a 36  increase in our large market same store segment and a 32  increase in our secondary market same store segment which were offset slightly by an 80  decrease in our nonsame store and other segment our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified for disposition additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note 16  segment information the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

on october 1 2013 we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonials net assets as a result of the merger the results of operations for 2013 include three months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio the results of operations for 2014 and 2015 include twelve months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states apart from the merger we acquired four  apartment communities for our portfolio in 2013  eight  in 2014  and seven  in 2015  offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine  apartment community dispositions in 2013  eight  in 2014  and 21 in 2015  

the following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



average effective monthly rent per unit is calculated as the average of monthly gross rent amounts for occupied units after the effect of leasing concessions plus thenprevailing market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing however it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit for additional discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons see the “trends” section below 

in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above we also owned an interest in two  commercial properties totaling approximately 238000  square feet of leasable space

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 



the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a decrease of 194 million related to the amortization of the fair value of inplace leases and resident relationships acquired as a result of the merger from the year ended december 31 2014   to the year ended december 31 2015  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 117 million driven by an increase in gross real estate assets from the year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2015  

property management expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  were approximately 310 million  a decrease of 11 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  the majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of 21 million partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of 06 million an increase in payroll expense of 03 million and an increase in incentive expense 03 million

we recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of 60 million during the year ended december 31 2014 as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease was primarily a result of recording a 34 million gain for the disposition of ansley village by midamerica multifamily fund ii or fund ii as well as a 28 million gain for the promote fee received from our fund ii partner during 2014 the promote fee was received as a result of maa achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the fund ii properties over the life of the joint venture there were no such gains recorded during the year ended december 31 2015 

discontinued operations 

we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of 54 million for the year ended december 31 2014 we did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31 2015 due to the adoption of asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2015  was approximately 185 million  an increase  of 102 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  this increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above

the comparison of the year ended december 31 2014 to the year ended december 31 2013 shows the segment break down based on the 2014  same store portfolios a comparison using the 2015  same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications as a result of the merger 

property revenues 

  

the following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average effective rent per unit of 43 for our large market and 19 for our secondary markets the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger which represents 2756 million of the increase the remaining 666 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger

funds from operations or ffo a nongaap financial measure represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items net income attributable to noncontrolling interest asset impairment gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis disposition of real estate assets includes but is not limited to sales of discontinued operations 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

core ffo a nongaap financial measure represents ffo excluding certain noncash or nonroutine items such as acquisition merger and integration expenses marktomarket debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity management believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance 

  

  

the following table is a reconciliation of core ffo and ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  dollars in thousands 



1  gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities excludes the promote fee recognized with the final liquidation of midamerica multifamily fund ii fund ii 

2  the loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended year ended december 31 2014  includes maas share of debt extinguishment costs incurred by our joint venture midamerica multifamily fund ii 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2015  increased approximately 483 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 506 million  and a decrease in merger and integration related expenses of 115 million which were partially offset by increases of 73 million  in property operating expenses and  48 million  in general and administrative expenses 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 1731 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of 3573 million  that was partially offset by the 1397 million  increase in property operating expenses and the 450 million  of increased interest expense 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2015  increased approximately 429 million  from the year ended december 31 2014  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 506 million  and the decrease in interest expense excluding the marktomarket debt adjustment of 67 million which was partially offset by the 73 million  increase in property operating expenses and the  48 million  in general and administrative expenses 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2014  increased by approximately 1334 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 3573 million  discussed above that was partially offset by the 1397 million  increase in property operating expenses and the 450 million  of increased interest expense 

trends 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 demand for apartments was strong as it was during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 this strength was evident on two fronts occupancy and effective rent per unit same store 

physical occupancy ended 2015 at 965 and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 961 for the year same store effective rent per unit continued to grow up 44 in the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2014 this compares to 33 growth achieved in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is maintaining a broad diversity of markets across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a welldiversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better as of december 31 2015 we were invested in approximately 40 defined metropolitan statistical areas with approximately 65 of our multifamily assets based on gross assets in large markets and 35 of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets 

new supply of rental units has increased in several of our key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance in most markets also we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties furthermore rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio in 2015 move outs attributable to single family rentals remained relatively consistent with prior years we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system as noted above physical occupancy ended 2015 strong and also averaged 75 basis points higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2016 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues the continued benefit of ancillary services such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2015  due to operating investing and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities 

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 4637 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 3854 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  this change was a result of various items including higher revenues as discussed above 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased to 1362 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 2038 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of seven  apartment communities and three land acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the acquisition of eight  apartment communities and no land acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014  additionally the apartment communities acquired during the year ended december 31 2014 included debt assumptions which reduced the amount of cash paid for these properties the increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of 21  apartment communities one  commercial property and one land parcel during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the sale of eight apartment communities two commercial properties and six land parcels during the year ended december 31 2014  the decrease in distributions from real estate joint ventures primarily resulted from the receipt of funds from the sale of two joint venture properties during the year ended december 31 2014 no joint venture properties were sold during 2015 the decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of two 1031b transactions during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the funding of three 1031b transactions and the return of escrow related to two 1031b transactions during the year ended december 31 2014  the decrease in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending for two projects commencing during the year ended december 31 2015 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased to 3166 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 2443 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the increase in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2014 to 2015 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we paid off the principal balance due on unsecured public bond notes payable originally issued by colonial that matured during the year the decrease in cash inflows from the exercise of stock options resulted from the exercise of approximately 7000 stock options during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the exercise of approximately 270000 stock options during the year ended december 31 2014  the increase in cash outflows 

from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to 077 per share during the year ended december 31 2015 from 073 per share during the year ended december 31 2014   

equity 

as of december 31 2015  maa owned 75408571  op units comprising a 948  limited partnership interest in the operating partnership while the remaining 4162996  outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership holders of op units other than maa and its corporate affiliates may require us to redeem their op units from time to time in which case we may at our option pay the redemption price either in cash in an amount per op unit equal in general to the average closing price of maas common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date or by delivering one share of our common stock subject to adjustment under specified circumstances for each op unit so redeemed in addition we have registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the 4162996  shares of our common stock which as of december 31 2015  were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnerships limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets if maa issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of op units in the operating partnership sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for maa common stock or may impair maas ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities 

in connection with the merger we issued approximately 319 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 26 million op units on october 1 2013

the interest rate markets for fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities or dmbs which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a delegated underwriting and servicing or dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae dmbs monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us 

approximately 70  of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2015  were borrowed through a credit facility credit enhanced by fannie mae which we also refer to as the fannie mae facility the fannie mae facility has line limit of 2400 million  of which 2400 million  was collateralized available to borrow and borrowed at december 31 2015  various fannie mae rate tranches of the fannie mae facility mature from 2016 through 2018 the fannie mae facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fannie mae dmbs rate which are creditenhanced by fannie mae and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating threemonth london interbank offered rate or libor less a spread that has averaged 017   

over the life of the fannie mae facility plus a credit enhancement fee of 062 we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and threemonth libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not have any relationships including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 14

insurance 

we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1 2015  we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that 

any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

our resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

impact of recently issued accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings at december 31 2015  322  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix or cap the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our credit facilities or tranches thereof mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes at december 31 2015 approximately 959  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

a summary of segment operating results for 2014  2013  and 2012  is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 additionally segment operating performance for such years is discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

  

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

2014 highlights 

 6 

 

operations strategy 

  

our goal is to generate our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

advances in technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in october 2012 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in february 2013 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartments 

in 2014 the maa website wwwmaaccom exceeded 36 million site visitors which translates into a 38 yearoveryear increase we attribute this increase to the merger as well as core web enhancements made throughout the year including improved site reporting capabilities refreshed property and regional content and extensive search engine optimization efforts in addition we continue to see strong mobile penetration totaling 25 of all site visitors in 2014 

acquisition strategy 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in large or secondary markets primarily throughout the southeast and southwest regions of the united states acquisitions along with dispositions as discussed below help us achieve our desired product mix geographic diversification and rebalance our portfolio portfolio 

growth allows for maximizing the efficiency of the existing overhead structure we have extensive experience in the acquisition of multifamily communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

the following apartment communities were acquired by us during the year ended december 31 2014  



1   acquired from midamerica multifamily fund ii llc a joint venture fund in which maa owned a onethird interest 

disposition strategy 

  

we sell apartment communities and other assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire additional apartment communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising additional capital when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other key terms of each proposal we also consider portfolio dispositions when such a structure is useful to maximize proceeds and efficiency of execution during the year ended december 31 2014  we disposed of eight  multifamily properties totaling 3063  units and two  commercial properties totaling 606000 square feet 

  

development strategy 

  

as another part of our growth strategy we invest in a limited number of development projects typically our agreements are structured to minimize the construction and development risk by contracting with unrelated parties to do the work through a fixed price contract cost overruns are covered by the developer or shared on a predetermined contractual basis we typically manage the leasing portion of the project as units become available for lease we may also engage in limited expansion development opportunities on existing communities in which we serve as the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties during the year ended december 31 2014  we incurred 708 million  in development costs 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 



  

redevelopment strategy 

in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have the ability to support additional rent growth as a result of the merger significant additional redevelopment opportunities exist and we expect redevelopment to continue to be an important part of our strategy during the year ended december 31 2014  we renovated 4549  units and exterior amenities for a total of 211 million  we believe that the rents received on these renovated units were approximately 93   above the normal market rate for similar but nonrenovated units 

  

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business strategy focused on producing a low cost and flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of our assets by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to avoid significant exposure in any given year and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate we also believe that we have significant access to the equity capital markets 

  

at december 31 2014  373  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings including 169  under our secured borrowings and 204  under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 40 to 45 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants in our credit facilities limit our netdebt total debt less cash on hand to undepreciated book value to 60 as of december 31 2014  our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 426  

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we plan to broaden our capital sources to include additional unsecured debt in order to take advantage of lower cost of capital in the public bond market we evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we may also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing refinancing or redeeming preferred shares 

  

on november 19 2013 we entered into distribution agreements with jp morgan securities llc bmo capital markets corp keybanc capital markets inc and ubs securities llc to sell up to 4500000 shares of our common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms as of december 31 2014  there were 4134989  shares remaining under the atm program 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these types of atm agreements through december 31 2014  



we also have a dividend and distribution reinvestment stock purchase plan or drspp which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2014  we issued a total of 1720  shares through the optional cash purchase feature of the drspp resulting in net proceeds of 121834  

share repurchase program 

  

in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2014  we had repurchased a total of approximately 19 million  shares  8  of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value would be enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price and expected rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2014  under this plan 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we plan to continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting residents across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside we also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

  

environmental matters 

  

as part of the normal acquisition process we generally obtain environmental studies on our apartment communities from outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the site reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition or development community however no assurance can be given that the studies or 

additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental risks see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investments and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

tax matters 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2014  maa paid total distributions of 292  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartments although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2014  

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

recent developments 

  

acquisitions 

  

on january 15 2015 we closed on the purchase of the 298unit residences at burlington creek apartment community located in kansas city missouri 

financings 

on january 30 2015 we paid off the 152 million  remaining principal balance of the mortgage on the farmington village apartment community 

on february 17 2015 we paid off the 911 million remaining principal balance on the tax free portion of the fannie mae credit facility as part of this payoff we incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately 04 million primarily related to legal costs and early termination fees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the us economy most recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the us economy continues to experience some weakness following a severe recession including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending in addition while the federal reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the economy is uncertain if the economic recovery slows or stalls or if the economy experiences another recession we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases demand for apartments may decline which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders 

  

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

 

at times we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit 

distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

approximately 367 of our portfolio is centered in our top five markets atlanta georgia charlotte north carolina austin texas raleighdurham north carolina and dallas texas our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of the portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 

substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

we may be unable to retain key employees   

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain our key employees there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect us 

breaches of our privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial conditions andor reputation 

the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems are critically important to us our business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees which may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations which continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another 

  

we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems however the security measures put in place by us cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems that such access will not whether temporarily or permanently impact interfere with or interrupt our operations or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts further privacy and information incidents have generally increased in recent years due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the future the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems and the information stored by us could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information we could be 

materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies   

we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility   

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

  

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to remediate properly hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and 

therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal 

 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  

increasing real estate taxes utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results 

  

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes utilities and insurance should rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions could be affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2014  we had two  development communities under construction totaling 514  units we have completed 48  units for the development projects as of december 31 2014  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2014  the amount of our total debt was approximately 352 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

 

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that indebtedness on our communities or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates accordingly increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 

we may incur additional debt in the future 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

at december 31 2014  we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 352 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt and total debt to capital among others in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

a change in united states government policy with regard to fannie mae and freddie mac could impact our financial condition 

  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the united states we utilize loan programs sponsored by these entities as one source of capital to finance our growth and our operations on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress which included options among others to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fannie mae and freddie mac we do not know when or if fannie mae or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2014  12  of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fannie mae with agency ratebased maturities ranging from 2015  through 2018  in 2014  we decreased the indebtedness outstanding on our fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities from 6518 million  on december 31 2013  to 4369 million  including paying off all outstanding amounts on the freddie mac credit facilities as of december 31 2014  and added 3958 million  of unsecured senior notes a decision by the us government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect us and our growth and operations 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt   

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which 

included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of its shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2014  no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock 

  

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down in addition although maas common stock are listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse the daily trading volume of maas common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maas common stock 

  

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common stock in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas stock 

  

the stock markets including nyse on which maa lists its common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 

 20 

   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnerships unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnerships unitholders also maa owns approximately 947  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas common stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate 

substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maas common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

t he operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions it would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which maa loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders furthermore maa would no longer be required to make distributions to its shareholders thus maa’s failure to qualify as a reit could also impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of its common stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit however maa cannot assure you that it is qualified as a reit or that maa will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if maa qualifies as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that maa does not distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

we may incur adverse tax consequences if colonial failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and if that occurs it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition   

prior to the merger colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code as discussed in exhibit 991 to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on september 16 2013 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and colonial’s qualification as a reit prior to the merger was generally subject to the same requirements risks and uncertainties as described in such exhibit 991 moreover the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership such as we do and colonial did prior to the merger the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a reit’s control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit 

if colonial is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to the merger maa will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities because maa owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the operating partnership the operating partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to maa to satisfy any such tax liabilities which would substantially reduce the operating partnership’s available cash including cash 

available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or maas shareholders because among other things 

 

maa is liable for any taxes payable by colonial for any periods prior to the merger in addition if colonial failed to qualify as a reit but we nonetheless qualified as a reit in the event of a taxable disposition of a former colonial asset during the ten years following the merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the merger in addition under the “investment company” rules under section 368 of the code if both maa and colonial were “investment companies” under such rules the failure of either colonial or us to have qualified as a reit could cause the merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders as a result of all these factors colonial’s failure to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize our qualification as a reit and require our operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership of which the maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 947  limited partner interest as of december 31 2014  maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership’s various subsidiaries 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 

acquisition of real estate assets 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases and other contracts in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets management divides forecasted net operating income noi by a market capitalization rate management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets although managements estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation if any would be made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors if impairment indicators exist for a longlived asset management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset if impairment indicators exist for goodwill management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets historically impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

  

cost capitalization 

repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred the carrying costs related to development 

projects including interest property taxes insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period are capitalized management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of the claims disputes and legal proceedings described or referenced above are subject to significant uncertainty the company records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable the company does not accrue the loss however for material loss contingencies if the unrecorded loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then the company discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if the company cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involve a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that the company considers in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in this note are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers the companys experience in similar matters the facts available to the company at the time of assessment and how the company intends to respond or has responded to the proceeding or claim the companys assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where the company is not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where the company believes a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances the company believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any

overview of the year ended december 31 2014   

  

as noted earlier on october 1 2013 we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonials net assets as a result of the merger the results of operations for 2013 include twelve months of results for maa and three months of results for the legacy colonial assets the results of operations for 2014 include twelve months of results for both the maa and colonial portfolios our december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  balance sheets include the combined assets and liabilities of maa and colonial all properties acquired from colonial have been placed in our nonsame store operating segment as the properties are recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least twelve months as of january 1 2014 

we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2014  as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses the increases in revenues came from a 45  increase in our large market same store segment a 18  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 2259  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of the merger the increase in expense came from a 28  increase in our large market same store segment a 21  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 2276  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily the result of the merger our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions including the colonial portfolio communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states apart from the merger we acquired seven  properties for our portfolio in 2012  four  in 2013  and eight  in 2014  offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine  apartment dispositions in 2012  nine  apartment dispositions in 2013  and eight  apartment dispositions in 2014  

the following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of 2014  2013  and 2012  



see discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons in the trends section below 

in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above we also owned or owned an interest in three  commercial properties totaling approximately 293000  square feet of leasable space 

average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

property revenues 

the following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average effective rent per unit of 30 the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger which represents 2733 million of the increase the remaining 666 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel property personnel bonuses building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and depreciation and amortization the following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of 39 million and utilities expenses of 13 million offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of 10 million the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger which represents 1069 million of the increase the remaining 274 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger 

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 



the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from capital spending made during the ordinary course of business the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger 

property management expenses 

property management expenses for the year ended december 31 2014  were approximately 321 million  an increase of 90 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  the majority of the increase was related to increases in payroll expenses of 30 million state franchise taxes of 27 million software maintenance of 21 million and incentive bonuses of 09 million as a result of the increased headcount and scope of work resulting from the merger 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2014  were approximately 209 million  an increase of 53 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  the majority of the increase was related to increases in incentive bonuses of 33 million and payroll expenses of 12 million as a result of the increased headcount resulting from the merger 

merger and integration related expenses 

merger related expenses primarily severance legal and professional costs for the acquisition of colonial were approximately 32 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  a decrease of 293 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  we also incurred integration related expenses primarily related to temporary systems staffing and facilities costs of 84 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  an increase of 33 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014  was approximately 1195 million  an increase of 435 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31 2013  to the year ended december 31 2014  of approximately 138 billion due primarily to the assumption of colonials debt as a result of the merger 

debt extinguishment 

loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31 2014  was approximately 26 million  an increase of 22 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was primarily the result of the prepayment of a loan for a property sold during the year ended december 31 2014  

discontinued operations 

we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of 54 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to a 768 million  gain for the year ended   december 31 2013  the decrease in the gain is caused by the proceeds received in 2014 being less than the proceeds received in 2013 in relation to the net book value of the properties sold and in accordance with newly adopted asu 201408 recording a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations in 2014 which is discussed further below 

dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations 

we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of 426 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  we did not record a similar gain for the year ended   december 31 2013  because we did not dispose of any properties that were excluded from discontinued operations 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2014  was approximately 83 million  an increase  of 43 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  this increase is primarily due to the increase in op unitholders as a result of the merger 

net income attributable to maa   

primarily as a result of the items discussed above net income attributable to maa increased by approximately 327 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  from the year ended december 31 2013

the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average rent per unit of approximately 39 the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger which represents 881 million of the increase the remaining 528 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel property personnel bonuses building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and depreciation and amortization the following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of 35 million and insurance expenses of 07 million the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger which represents 341 million of the increase the remaining 206 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger 

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 



the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 156 million  an increase of 18 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the majority of the increase was related to an increase in tax preparation fees audit fees and stock incentives 

merger and integration related expenses 

merger related expenses for the acquisition of colonial were approximately 324 million for the year ended december 31 2013 we also incurred integration related expenses of 51 million for the year ended december 31 2013 there were no merger related expenses or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 759 million  an increase of 180 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding of 4516 million from the year ended december 31 2012  to the year ended december 31 2013  due primarily to the assumption of colonials debt as a result of the merger 

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 51 million  a decrease of 19 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2013  had lower net income than the properties sold in 2012  

we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of 768 million  and 416 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively the increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than the net book value of the properties in 2013  compared to 2012  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 40 million  an decrease of 06 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  

net income attributable to maa 

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to maa increased by approximately 101 million  in the year ended december 31 2013  from the year ended december 31 2012  

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items net income attributable to noncontrolling interest asset impairment gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

core ffo represents ffo excluding certain noncash or nonroutine items such as acquisition merger and integration expenses marktomarket debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income maa believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance 

the following table is a reconciliation of core ffo and ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  dollars in thousands 



1  gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities excludes the promote fee recognized with the final liquidation of midamerica multifamily fund ii fund ii 

2  the loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31 2014  includes maas share of debt extinguishment costs incurred by our joint venture midamerica multifamily fund ii 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 1731 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 3550 million  discussed above that was partially offset by the 1390 million  increase in property operating expenses the 435 million  of increased interest expense the 90 million  of increased property management expenses and the 53 million  of increased general and administrative expenses 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 347 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of 1591 million  discussed above that was partially offset by the 592 million  increase in property operating expenses the 324 million  of merger related expenses and the 180 million  of increased interest expense 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 1334 million  from the year ended december 31 2013  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 3550 million  discussed above that was partially offset by the 1390 million  increase in property operating expenses the 435 million  of increased interest expense the 90 million  of increased property management expenses and the 53 million  of increased general and administrative expenses 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by approximately 646 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of 1591 million  discussed above that was partially offset by the 592 million  increase in property operating expenses and the 180 million  of increased interest expense 

trends 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 demand for apartments was strong as it was during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 this strength was evident on two fronts same store average physical occupancy during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 was strong ending the year at 955 occupancy and averaging 953 for the year while same store effective rent per unit continued to grow up 33 in the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 in addition effective rent was up 40 for the month of december 2014 as compared to the month of december 2013 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a welldiversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better as of december 31 2014 we were invested in approximately 49 defined metropolitan statistical areas with approximately 64 of our multifamily assets based on gross assets in large markets and 36 of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets 

new supply of rental units has increased in several key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2014 we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance also we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental has not been a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets or submarkets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices occurred we saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system as noted above physical occupancy ended the year strong and also averaged nearly 60 basis points better in 2014 as compared to 2013 as we continue into the typically slower winter leasing season the level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2015 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues the continued benefit of ancillary services such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31 2013  to the year ended december 31 2014  due to operating investing and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities 

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 3841 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 2584 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  this change was a result of various items including higher revenue as discussed above 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 2038 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 838 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of eight  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the acquisition of four  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2013  the increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of eight  apartment communities and two  commercial properties during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the sale of nine  apartment communities during the year ended december 31 2013  the increase in cash outflows for normal capital improvements is due to the fact that we owned more properties throughout 2014 than we owned throughout 2013 during october 2013 we acquired 115 apartment communities through our merger with colonial owning these properties for all of 2014 led to increased capital improvement spending the decrease in cash outflows from the return funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the release of funds held in escrow for two 1031b transactions at december 31 2014  compared to having funds held in escrow for the same two 1031b transactions at december 31 2013  we also acquired 635 million of cash during the merger which accounts for the decrease in cash acquired in connection with the colonial merger from 2013 to 2014 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased to 2443 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 943 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the primary drivers of this change are as follows 



the decrease in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2013 to 2014 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit the increase in cash inflows from proceeds on notes payable is due to the fact that in 2014 we issued 400 million in senior unsecured notes while in 2013 we issued only 350 million in senior unsecured notes the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2014 we paid off 1922 million of bonds originally issued by colonial that matured during the year the decrease in cash inflows from the proceeds from the issuance of common shares is due to the fact that during 2013 we issued approximately 365000 shares through our atm plan we issued no shares through our atm plan during 2014 the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares is due to the fact that we had more shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 than during 2013 in connection with the merger in october 2013 we issued approximately 319 million shares the additional shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 along with our increase in the dividend rate led to an increase in the aggregate amount of dividends paid during the year ended december 31 2014  

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities computed in accordance with gaap less funding of normal capital improvements to existing real estate assets distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap measurement of performance or liquidity our calculation of free cash flow may differ from the methodology for calculating free cash flow utilized by other companies and accordingly may not be comparable to such other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  dollars in thousands 



while we had sufficient liquidity to permit dividend distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the dividend distribution rate 

we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations annual refurbishment of our properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties our capital resources consist of both equity and debt securities 

equity 

as of december 31 2014  we owned 75267675  op units comprising a 947  limited partnership interest in the operating partnership while the remaining 4191152  outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership holders of op units other than us and our affiliates may require us to redeem their op units from time to time in which case we may at our option pay the redemption price either in cash in an amount per op unit equal in general to the average closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date or by delivering one share of our common stock subject to adjustment under specified circumstances for each op unit so redeemed in addition we have registered the 4191152  shares of our common stock which as of december 31 2014  were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnerships limited partners under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets if we issue shares of our common stock upon the redemption of op units in our operating partnership sales of substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities 

in connection with the merger we issued approximately 319 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 26 million op units on october 1 2013

debt 

the following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps outstanding as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 



  

 

as of december 31 2014  we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 6250 million  to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges we had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 2553 million  as of december 31 2014

the following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding fixed or hedged debt as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 



at december 31 2014  we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by fannie mae and a 5000 million  bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks together these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of 9513 million  with all but 182 million  collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2014  we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 4959 million  at december 31 2014  

secured credit facilities 

we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and on rate renewals for fannie mae fannie mae provided credit enhancement for approximately 4369 million  of our outstanding debt through our fannie mae facilities as defined below as of december 31 2014  

  

the interest rate markets for fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities or dmbs which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a delegated underwriting and servicing or dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae dmbs monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us

on june 27 2014 we paid off 1982 million under our credit facility withor credit enhanced by freddie mac also referred to as the freddie mac facility as of december 31 2014  we no longer had any borrowings outstanding through the freddie mac facility

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2014  and 2013  we did not have any relationships including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

as of december 31 2014  we had a 250 ownership interest in the mckinney joint venture which consists of undeveloped land

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2014  we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

our resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

the following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings at december 31 2014  373  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix or cap the interest rate on a portion of our 

variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our credit facilities or tranches thereof mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes approximately 967  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments at december 31 2014  we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our interest rate swaps and caps the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they expire weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date dollars in thousands

on october 1 2013 maa completed its previously announced merger with colonial pursuant to the merger agreement martha merger sub lp or op merger sub a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the operating partnership merged with and into colonial realty limited partnership which we refer to as colonial lp with colonial lp being the surviving entity of the merger and becoming a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of our operating partnership which is referred to as the partnership merger the partnership merger was part of the transactions contemplated by the previously announced agreement and plan of merger entered into on june 3 2013 among maa our operating partnership op merger sub colonial and colonial lp pursuant to which maa and colonial combined through a merger of colonial with and into maa with maa surviving the merger which is referred to as the parent merger we refer to the parent merger together with the partnership merger as the merger in this annual report on form 10k under the terms of the merger agreement each common share of beneficial interest in colonial or colonial common share was converted into the right to receive 036 of a newly issued share of maa common stock in addition each limited partner interest in colonial lp designated as a “class a unit” and a “partnership unit” under the limited partnership agreement of colonial lp which we refer to in this report as colonial lp units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the partnership merger was converted into common units in our operating partnership at the 036 conversion rate 

the net assets and results of operations of colonial are included in our consolidated financial statements from the closing date october 1 2013 through december 31 2013  the end of our fiscal year 

  

reporting segments 

  

as of december 31 2013  we owned or had an ownership interest in 275  multifamily apartment communities located in 14  states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows additionally we owned five  commercial properties in two  states senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments 

 

on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons for financial reporting purposes the operating results of the colonial assets that we acquired in the merger are within the nonsame store communities and other reporting segment the legacy colonial assets will not be eligible to be included in same store segments until january 1 2015 we utilize net operating income or noi in evaluating the performance total noi represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale we believe noi is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance during 2013  we added 13 communities to our same store portfolio and moved 11 communities to our nonsame store and other segment in addition as a result of the merger we added 115 whollyowned apartment communities and 4 commercial properties to our nonsame store and other segment

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

2013 highlights 

 6 

 

operations strategy 

  

our goal is to generate our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

 

we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information 

investment in new technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in october 2012 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in february 2013 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartments 

in 2013 the features and functionality of our website httpwww maaccom were enhanced to increase a user’s engagement and search capability improvements included a new responsive website design new photography enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual maa community homepages we also overhauled our mobile applications these overall enhancements have increased our web visitor traffic yearoveryear to almost 22 million  visitors in 2013  an increase of 34  with mobile traffic at 12 million  visitors an increase of 173  

acquisition strategy 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in large or secondary markets primarily throughout the sunbelt region of the united states acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix geographic diversification or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of the overall community net operating income we have extensive experience and research 

based skills in the acquisition of multifamily communities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

  

the following apartment communities in addition to the 115  properties encompassing 34370  units acquired through the merger were acquired for our whollyowned portfolio during the year ended december 31 2013  



 

disposition strategy 

  

we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other key terms of each proposal during 2013  we disposed of nine  communities totaling 2108  units 

  

development strategy 

  

periodically we invest in limited expansion development projects generally through feebased development agreements using fixed price or cost controlled construction contracts these contracts can have variability to cover any project cost overruns that may occur some development agreements require that cost overruns are contractually shared with the developer up to a specified level while other development agreements stipulate that cost overruns are the responsibility of the developer while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties during 2013  we incurred 530 million  in development costs 

the following multifamily projects were under development as of december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 



  redevelopment strategy 

beginning in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent during the year ended december 31 2013  we renovated 2576  units for a total of 113 million at an average rental rate that we believe was approximately 11   above the normal market rate increase 

  

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets focused on producing low costs combined with a flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of our assets by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to avoid significant exposure in any given year and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

  

at december 31 2013  42  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings including 22  under our secured borrowings and 20  under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 40 to 45 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants in our credit facilities limit our netdebt total debt less cash on hand to undepreciated book value to 60 as of december 31 2013  our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 42  

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we have   received an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies thes e ratings support our plan to broaden our capital sources to include additional unsecured debt in order to take advantage of lower cost of capital in the public bond market we evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing refinancing or redeeming preferred stock 

  

we have entered into sales agreements to sell shares of our common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms we terminated our agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co raymond james  associates inc and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated on february 7 2013 and on february 25 2013 as amended and restated on november 19 2013 we entered into distribution agreements with jp morgan securities llc bmo capital markets corp keybanc capital markets inc and ubs securities llc to sell up to 4500000 shares of our common stock with materially the same terms as our previous atm agreements as of december 31 2013  there were 4134989  shares remaining under the atm program 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these atm agreements through december 31 2013  



we also have a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2013  we issued a total of 1068  shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan resulting in net proceeds of 68613  

on march 2 2012 we closed on an underwritten public offering of 1955000  shares of common stock ubs investment bank and jefferies  company inc acted as joint bookrunning managers this transaction resulted in net proceeds of 1201 million  no such issuances occurred during 2011 or 2013 

  

share repurchase program 

  

in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2013  we had repurchased a total of approximately 19 million  shares  8  of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value would be enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price and expected rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2013  under this plan 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 10 

 

moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside in spite of a weak economic environment we also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

  

environmental matters 

  

as part of the normal acquisition process we obtain environmental studies on our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms as part of the due diligence process for the colonial merger we reviewed the existing environmental studies and other related documents outlining any potential risk on these properties the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental problems see risk factors  risks relating to our real estate investements and our operations  environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

the environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

tax matters 

  

maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit maa must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our shareholders annually if maa maintains its 

qualification as a reit maa generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually even if maa continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and its property in 2013  maa paid total distributions of 278  per share of common stock to its shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartments although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2013  

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities 

  

risks relating to the colonial merger 

we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger   

we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and integrating colonial’s business operations networks systems technologies policies and procedures with ours there are a large number of systems that are in the process of being integrated including property management revenue management resident payment credit screening lease administration website content management purchasing accounting payroll fixed assets and financial reporting moreover there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these integration expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time as a result expenses associated with the merger could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses 

we may be unable to integrate colonial’s businesses with ours successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe 

because colonial was a public company we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting colonial’s public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems these savings are expected to be realized upon full integration which is expected to occur over the 18month period following the closing of the merger however we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of colonial with our business practices and operations potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

for all these reasons you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

we may be unable to retain key employees as a result of the merger   

  

our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain key former employees of colonial as well as our key employees key employees may depart because of among other things issues relating to the combination of the two companies uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the merger accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past 

the merger resulted in changes to maas board of directors that may affect our strategy going forward 

the composition of maas board of directors changed as a result of the merger maas board of directors now consists of twelve members including all seven directors from maas board of directors prior to the merger and five directors who were members of the colonial board of trustees prior to the merger this new composition of maas board of directors may affect our business strategy and operations going forward 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger   

we have expanded our operations as a result of the merger and intend to continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions of properties some of which may involve complex challenges our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage the integration of the colonial operations and our expansion opportunities each of which may pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner and upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations costs regulatory compliance and service quality and to maintain other necessary internal controls there is no assurance that our expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements synergies or other benefits from any future acquisitions we may complete 

we may incur adverse tax consequences if colonial failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and if that occurs it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition   

prior to the merger colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code as discussed in exhibit 991 to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on september 16 2013 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and colonial’s qualification as a reit prior to the merger was generally subject to the same requirements risks and uncertainties as described in such exhibit 991 moreover the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership such as we do and colonial did prior to the merger the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a reit’s control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit 

if colonial is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to the merger maa will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities because maa owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the operating partnership the operating partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to maa to satisfy any such tax liabilities which would substantially reduce the operating partnership’s available cash including cash available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or maas shareholders because among other things 

 

maa is liable for any taxes payable by colonial for any periods prior to the merger in addition if colonial failed to qualify as a reit but we nonetheless qualified as a reit in the event of a taxable disposition of a former colonial asset during the ten years following the merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the merger in addition under the “investment company” rules under section 368 of the code if both maa and colonial were “investment companies” under such rules the failure of either colonial or us to have qualified as a reit could cause the merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders as a result of all these factors colonial’s failure to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize our qualification as a reit and require our operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

  

economic slowdown in the united states and downturns in the housing and real estate markets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

there have been significant declines in economic growth both in the united states and globally both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy have experienced unfavorable conditions which adversely affected our business factors such as weakened economies and related reduction in spending falling home prices and job losses price volatility andor dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our tenants and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants and other contracting parties which could adversely affect our revenues furthermore our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates or at all could be adversely affected by increases in supply and deterioration in multifamily markets and is partially dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels downturns in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties the increasing rental of excess forsale condominiums and single family homes which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives may reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and depress rental rates in certain markets when we experience a downturn we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable but if the markets remain weak over extended periods of time or deteriorate significantly our ability to lease our properties or our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may weaken which would adversely affect our revenues 

  

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders 

  

our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

 

at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

our operations are concentrated in the sunbelt region of the united states in particular the state of texas we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 

approximately 395 of our portfolio is centered in our top five markets dallas texas atlanta georgia austin texas raleighdurham north carolina and charlotte north carolina our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in and other factors relating to these geographic areas including supply and demand for apartments in these areas zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters the value of the portfolio our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 

substantial competition among multifamily communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 

there are numerous other multifamily communities and real estate companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities the number of competitive multifamily communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on 1 our ability to rent the apartments and the rents charged and 2 development and acquisition opportunities the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations 

  

the current united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate control executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing economic downturn these initiatives have created uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the united states public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

breaches of our data security could materially harm our business and reputation 

we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our tenants and employees while we have implemented a variety of security measures to protect the confidentiality of this information and periodically review and improve our security measures there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any breach of our data security measures and loss of this information may result in legal liability and costs   

including damages and penalties as well as damage to our reputation that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies   

we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility   

we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

  

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in on around or under such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of or failure to remediate properly hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials and other hazardous or toxic substances federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect operation management development or control of real property we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and 

therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and claims for injuries to persons and property 

our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and to proceed accordingly we cannot assure you however that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal 

 

certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability thus we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers moldrelated claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to the extent not covered by our pollution policy the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage health concerns or allegations thereof arise 

changes in the system for establishing united states accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations 

  

accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with gaap gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board or fasb an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board or iasb is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards or ifrs ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

it is unclear at this time if or how the sec will transition from gaap to ifrs switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion is uncertain we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 

  

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and 

ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results 

  

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

  

we may experience increased costs arising from health care reform 

  

in march 2010 the united states government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which among other things includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits the legislation imposes implementation effective dates extending through 2020 and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations therefore due to the phasedin nature of the implementation and the lack of interpretive guidance in some cases it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on our financial results possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

as of december 31 2013  we had five  development communities under construction totaling 1461  units we have completed 509  units for the development projects as of december 31 2013  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2013  the amount of our total debt was approximately 347 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with among other things our acquisition development and operating activities 

the degree of our leverage creates significant risks including the following 

 

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest the risk that indebtedness on our communities or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 

we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates accordingly increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 

we may incur additional debt in the future 

we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings including our revolving credit facility as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur accordingly subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 

the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 

at december 31 2013 we had outstanding borrowings of approximately 347 billion  our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth interest coverage ratios maximum secured debt and total debt to capital among others in the event that an event of default occurs our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to 

be due and payable immediately which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

a change in united states government policy with regard to fannie mae and freddie mac could impact our financial condition 

  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the united states we utilize loan programs sponsored by these entities as one source of capital to finance our growth and our operations on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress which included options among others to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fannie mae and freddie mac we do not know when or if fannie mae or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2013  19  of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fannie mae or freddie mac with agency ratebased maturities ranging from 2014  through 2018  in 2013  we decreased the indebtedness outstanding on our fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities from 8033 million  on december 31 2012  to 6518 million  on december 31 2013  we added 7992 million  of unsecured senior notes decreased borrowings under unsecured lines of credit by 230 million and added an additional 4000 million  of unsecured term loans a decision by the us government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect us and our growth and operations 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt   

a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a significant amount of debt outstanding we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings in addition a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

risks related to maas organization and ownership of its stock 

  

maas ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock 

  

maas charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by its board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the 

code owning 50 or more of its shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits maa 

 

 

the redemption price may be paid at maas option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by maa issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

 

provisions of maas charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa 

  

ownership limit 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

maas charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa even if a change in control were in maa shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2013  no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

as a tennessee corporation maa is subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if maas acquisition would be in maa shareholders’ best interests 

  

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common shares 

  

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common shares to go down in addition although maas common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

  

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common shares 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason maas shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of maas common shares in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maas shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maas shares 

  

the stock markets including nyse on which maa lists its common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of maas common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in maas common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maas publicly traded securities are the following 

   

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

risks related to the operating partnerships organization and ownership of op units 

the operating partnerships existing unitholders have limited approval rights which may prevent the operating partnerships sole general partner maa from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa 

maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership dissolve the operating partnership or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates or class a op units the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maas ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

in certain circumstances certain of the operating partnerships unitholders must approve the operating partnerships sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders 

in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnerships unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnerships unitholders and all shareholders of maa 

maa its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnerships affairs 

maa as the operating partnerships sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors has a substantial influence on the operating partnerships affairs maa its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnerships unitholders also maa owns approximately 947  of the op units and as such will have substantial influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to the operating partnerships unitholders for approval 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maas common stock which would affect the redemption price of the op units 

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of maas shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for maa to distribute and in fact would likely increase maas borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of maas common stock to go down which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units or if maa so elects the value of maas common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units in addition although maas stock is listed on the nyse the daily trading volume of maas shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result maas investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to maas results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maas common stock which may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations 

as discussed above under “risks related to maa’s organization and ownership of its stock” changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to maa’s results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa’s common stock in addition the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders which may cause maa to not have the funds to service its debt or to pay dividends to its shareholders maa’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa’s ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders 

if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions it would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which maa loses its qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa’s shareholders furthermore maa would no longer be required to make distributions to its shareholders thus maa’s failure to qualify as a reit could also impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of its common stock 

maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit however maa cannot assure you that it is qualified as a reit or that maa will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa’s control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if maa qualifies as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that maa does not distribute to its shareholders in addition maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 

we believe that the operating partnership qualifies and has so qualified since its formation as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation no assurance can be provided however that the internal revenue service or irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates in addition the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders” above

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership of which the maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 947  limited partner interest as of december 31 2013  maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership’s various subsidiaries 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets acquisition of real estate assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill fair value of derivative financial instruments and loss contingencies 

  

revenue recognition and real estate sales 

we primarily lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases generally with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

we record gains and losses on real estate sales in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate for sale transactions meeting the requirements for the full accrual method we remove the assets and liabilities from our consolidated balance sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes for properties contributed to joint ventures maa records gains on the partial sale in proportion to the outside partners’ interest in the venture 

  

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets 

  

we carry real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation and amortization is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 6 months for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred 

  

acquisition of real estate assets 

  

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases 

we allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land building and furniture fixtures and equipment determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of these assets management determines the asifvacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers these methods include using stabilized net operating income or noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates the purchase price is also allocated to any debt and other liabilities that are assumed as part of the transaction 

  

in allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit management concluded that the residential leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year 

for larger portfolio style acquisitions like the merger management engages a third party valuation specialist to assist with the fair value assessment which includes an allocation of the purchase price similar to managements methods the third party uses cash flow analysis as well as an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of assets the third party uses stabilized noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates management reviews the inputs used by the third party specialist as well as the allocation of the purchase price provided by the third party to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with managements policy the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation if any are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of properties classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate we determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

we utilize certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter and have been found to be highly effective 

we measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method or the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position 

the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

the valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities   additionally we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements notes 7 and 8 for further discussion 

loss contingencies 

the outcomes of claims disputes and legal proceedings including those described in item 3 — legal proceedings of this form 10k are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable we do not accrue the loss however if the loss or an additional loss in excess of the accrual is at least a reasonable possibility and material then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if such reasonable estimate can be made if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss then that is disclosed 

the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable often involve a series of complex judgments about future events among the factors that we consider in this assessment including with respect to the matters disclosed in item 3 — legal proceedings of this form 10k are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency if reasonably estimable the progress of the matter existing law and precedent the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers our experience in similar matters the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond or have responded to the proceeding or claim our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following i the damages sought are indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages iii the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties andor iv discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss can be made in such instances we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters including a possible eventual loss or business impact if any 

overview of the year ended december 31 2013   

  

as noted earlier on october 1 2013 we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonials net assets as a result of the merger the results of operations for 2013 include 12 months of results for maa and three months of results for colonial our december 31 2013 balance sheets include the combined assets and liabilities of maa and colonial all properties acquired from colonial have been placed in our nonsame store operating segment as the properties are recent acquisitions and have not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months 

we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2013  as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses the increases in revenues came from a 51  increase in our large market same store segment a 28  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 4788  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of the merger the increase in expense came from a 27  increase in our large market same store segment a 21  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 4790  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily the result of the merger our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section 

as discussed above all properties acquired through the merger have been placed in our nonsame store operating segment based on colonials same store classification of its properties prior to the merger properties acquired from colonial experienced an increase in revenue of 33 an increase in property operating expenses of 24 and an increase in noi of 38 based on the three months ended december 31 2013  compared to the three months ended december 31 2012  which covers a period of time for which maas management was not involved 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states apart from the merger we acquired eleven  properties for our 100 owned portfolio in 2011  seven  in 2012  and four  in 2013  we also purchased one  property through one of our joint ventures in 2011  we did not purchase any properties through our joint ventures in 2012  or 2013  offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were two  property dispositions in 2011  nine  dispositions in 2012  and nine  dispositions in 2013  

the following table shows our multifamily real estate assets as of 2013  2012  and 2011  



see discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons in the trends section below 

in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above we also owned or owned an interest in five  commercial properties totaling 12 million  square feet of leasable space 

average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

property revenues 

the following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 



the increases in property revenues from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups are primarily a result of increased average rent per unit of 39 the increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger 

property operating expenses 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel property personnel bonuses building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and depreciation and amortization the following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 



the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes general liability insurance and contract labor with real estate taxes being the largest component the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes general liability insurance and commissions with real estate taxes being the largest component the increase in property operating expenses from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger 

depreciation and amortization 

the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 



the increases in depreciation and amortization expense from our large market same store and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our nonsame store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 156 million  an increase of 18 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the majority of the increase was related to an increase in tax preparation fees audit fees and stock incentives 

merger and integration costs 

merger related expenses for the acquisition of colonial were approximately 324 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  we also incurred integration related expenses of 51 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  there were no merger related expenses or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31 2012  

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 759 million  an increase of 180 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31 2012  to the year ended december 31 2013  of approximately 4516 million due primarily to the assumption of colonials debt as a result of the merger 

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 51 million  a decrease of 19 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2013  had lower net income than the properties sold in 2012  

  

we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of 768 million  and 416 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively the increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than the net book value of the properties in 2013  compared to 2012  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2013  was approximately 40 million  a decrease  of 06 million  from the year ended december 31 2012

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to maa increased by approximately 564 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  from the year ended december 31 2011  

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items net income attributable to noncontrolling interest asset impairment gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

core ffo represents ffo excluding certain noncash or nonroutine items such as acquisition merger and integration expenses marktomarket debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income maa believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance 

the following table is a reconciliation of core ffo and ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  dollars in thousands 



ffo for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 347 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately 1591 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 592 million  increase in property operating expenses as well as the 324 million  in merger related expenses and 180 million  of increased interest expense 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2012  increased approximately 408 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately 662 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 206 million  increase in property operating expenses 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 646 million  from the year ended december 31 2012  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately 1591 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 592 million  increase in property operating expenses as well as the 180 million  of increased interest expense 

core ffo for the year ended december 31 2012  increased by approximately 385 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of approximately 662 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 206 million  increase in property operating expenses 

trends 

during the year ended december 31 2013  rental demand for apartments was strong as it was during the year ended december 31 2012  this strength was evident on two fronts same store average physical occupancy during the year ended december 31 2013  was essentially flat with the year ended december 31 2012  9575 for 2013  as compared to 9583 for 2012  while same store effective rent per unit continued to grow up 39 in 2013  over 2012  we have maintained this momentum despite job formation one of the primary drivers of apartment demand continuing to increase at a below average pace 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a well diversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better as of december 31 2013  including the impact of the merger we were invested in approximately 46 defined metropolitan statistical areas with approximately 66 of our multifamily assets based on gross assets in large markets and 34 of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets 

new supply of rental units entering the market remained below historical new supply delivery averages but multifamily permitting did pick up in 2013  as compared to 2012  we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to an increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets or submarkets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets 

our focus continues to be on increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system while maintaining strong physical occupancy as noted above phyisical occupancy remained strong while effective rents continued to grow with strong occupancy in place as we continue through the winter leasing season we will be able to maximize the markets pricing potential in the first quarter of 2014 

overall same store revenues increased 41 for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  this increase was primarily due to rising rents and helped by increases in ancillary income also we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues the continued benefit of ancillary services such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

to fund the merger we issued approximately 319 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 26 million op units on october 1 2013 

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 2646 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  from 2110 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  this change was a result of various items including higher revenue as discussed above 

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 838 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 3292 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  due to the factors discussed below in the year ended december 31 2013  we had acquisition cash outflows of 1392 million  compared to 3120 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  during 2013  we had cash outflows of 530 million  for development activities compared to 740 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  during 2013  we also had cash outflows of 110 million  for improvements to existing real estate assets compared to 144 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease in cash outflows from investing activities was offset by an increase in cash inflows from disposition activity during the year ended december 31 2013  we had cash inflows of approximately 1290 million  which were related to the sale of nine  properties in the year ended december 31 2012  we had cash inflows of 1101 million  which were related to the sale of nine  properties from our same store portfolio

substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2013  we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

our resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation

separate but consecutive statements in both choices an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income asu 201105 is applied retrospectively the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 but allows for early adoption we adopted asu 201105 for the annual report for fiscal year ended december 31 2011 and this changed the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings at december 31 2013  42  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix or cap the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to have our credit facilities or tranches thereof mature across multiple years which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes approximately 97  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments at december 31 2013  we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

financial information about segments 

  

as of december 31 2012  we owned or had an ownership interest in 166  multifamily apartment communities in 13  different states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments 

 

on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons we utilize net operating income or noi in evaluating the performance total noi represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale we believe noi is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance 

  

a summary of segment operating results for 2012  2011  and 2010  is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 13 additionally segment operating performance for such years is discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k

we operate in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information we have also implemented revised utility billing processes rolled out new websites including a new resident portal facilitating communication with residents and enabling online payments of rents and fees online lease applications and improved webbased marketing programs 

  property and asset management focus 

  

we have traditionally emphasized property management and over the past several years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and revenue management a majority of our property managers are certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals we also provide our own inhouse leadership development program consisting of a threemodule program followed by two comprehensive case studies which was developed with the assistance of us learning inc 

  

acquisition and joint venture strategy 

  

one of our growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities for our whollyowned portfolio that are diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states and that meet our investment criteria we have extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition we will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

  

another of our growth strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for us at present we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old or older with younger acquisitions becoming part of the whollyowned portfolio 

as of december 31 2012  for this strategy we were partners in three joint ventures midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii and midamerica multifamily fund iii llc or fund iii these joint ventures did not acquire any properties during 2012 

  

the following apartment communities were acquired for our whollyowned portfolio during the year ended december 31 2012  

  



 

disposition strategy 

  

at 15 years weighted average age based on gross asset values we believe that we have one of the younger portfolios in the multifamily reit sector and strive to maintain a wellconditioned portfolio of young assets believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment from timetotime we dispose of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within our market area typically we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs from timetotime we also may dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above during 2012  we disposed of nine  properties totaling 2254  units 

  

development and redevelopment strategy 

  

periodically we invest in limited expansion development projects through feebased development agreements using fixed price or cost controlled construction contracts these contracts can have variability to cover any project cost overruns that may occur some development agreements require that cost overruns are contractually shared with the developer up to a specified level while other development agreements stipulate that cost overruns are the responsibility of the developer in october 2010 we purchased land in franklin nashville tennessee and entered into an agreement to develop a 428unit apartment community on the site construction began in late 2010 as of december 31 2012  all 428 units have been completed and were 77 leased up during 2011 we also began developing a 210unit phase ii to the 1225 south church apartments in charlotte north carolina that were purchased in december 2010 as of december 31 2012  no units have been delivered for 1225 south church we purchased land in little rock arkansas during 2011 and entered into a development agreement to develop a 312unit apartment community on the site all 312  units for the little rock development have been completed and delivered and were 77 leased up as of december 31 2012  during 2012 we purchased 106 acres of land and began construction on a new 270unit community located in the charleston south carolina metropolitan area as of december 31 2012  no units have been delivered for the land in charleston south carolina during 2012 we also purchased 20 acres of land and began construction on a new 294unit community located in jacksonville florida as of december 31 2012  no units have been delivered while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties 

  

beginning in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent during the year ended december 31 2012  we renovated 3236  units at an average rental rate that we believe was approximately 10   above the normal market rate increase 

  

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets focused on producing low costs combined with a flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of our assets by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value in the past we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

  

at december 31 2012  37  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings including 26  under our secured borrowings and 11  under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 43 to 48 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants in our credit facilities limit our netdebt total debt less cash on hand to undepreciated book value to 60 as of december 31 2012  our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 44  

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we have  received an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies thes e ratings support our plan to broaden our capital sources to include additional unsecured debt in order to take advantage of lower cost of capital in the public bond market we evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is below our net present value we 

also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities when appropriate opportunities arise we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing refinancing or redeeming preferred stock 

  

we have entered into sales agreements to sell shares of our common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms most recently with cantor fitzgerald  co raymond james  associates inc and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated as of december 31 2012  there were 578015  shares remaining under the atm program at december 31 2012  we were nearing the end of these agreements so on february 7 2013 we terminated these programs we anticipate entering into similar agreements in the near future 

  

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these agreements through december 31 2012  

  



we also have a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2012  we issued a total of 729  shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan resulting in net proceeds of 48000  on march 2 2012 we closed on an underwritten public offering of 1955000  shares of common stock ubs investment bank and jeffries  company inc acted as joint bookrunning managers this transaction resulted in net proceeds of 1201 million  no such issuances occurred during 2011 or 2010 

  

share repurchase program 

  

in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2012  we had repurchased a total of approximately 19 million  shares  8  of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2012 under this plan 

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition we make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

  

environmental matters 

  

as part of the acquisition process we obtain environmental studies on our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

  

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

  

we are aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold we have established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease we also have a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold therefore we believe that our exposure to this issue is mitigated appropriately 

  

the environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

we believe that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

qualification as a real estate investment trust reit 

  

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our shareholders annually as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to 

certain federal state and local taxes on our income and our property in 2012  we paid total distributions of 264  per common share to our shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement 

recent developments 

  

acquisitions 

  

on february 1 2013 we closed on the purchase of the 310unit milstead village apartment community located in kennesaw atlanta georgia this property was previously a part of our fund i joint venture 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business prospects results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities 

  

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

  

economic slowdown in the united states and downturns in the housing and real estate markets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

there have been significant declines in economic growth both in the united states and globally both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy have experienced unfavorable conditions which adversely affected our revenues although our industry and the united states economy showed signs of improvement in 2012 we cannot accurately predict that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future or that our financial condition and results of operations will not continue to be adversely effected factors such as weakened economies and related reduction in spending falling home prices and job losses price volatility andor dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our tenants and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants and other contracting parties which could adversely affect our revenues furthermore our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates or at all could be adversely affected by increases in supply and deterioration in multifamily markets and is partially dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels downturns in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties the increasing rental of excess forsale condominiums and single family homes which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives may reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and depress rental rates in certain markets when we experience a downturn we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable but if the markets remain weak over extended periods of time or deteriorate significantly our ability to lease our properties or our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may weaken which would adversely effect our revenues 

  

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

  

 11 

 

at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities 

  

we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations 

  

the current united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate control executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees taxes or other costs on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

  

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the united states public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we are dependent on key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of one or several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

  

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

  

we intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties we must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall results of operations 

  

we may not be able to sell communities when appropriate 

  

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions further we own seven communities which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b taxfree exchange unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service our debt and to make distributions to our shareholders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

  

changes in the system for establishing united states accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations 

  

accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states or gaap gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board or fasb an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board or iasb is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards or ifrs ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

  

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

  

it is unclear at this time if or how the sec will transition from gaap to ifrs switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be 

adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 

  

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace or rebuild a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results 

  

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are in large part outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should significantly rise our operating results could be negatively impacted and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected 

  

we may experience increased costs arising from health care reform 

  

in march 2010 the united states government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which among other things includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits the legislation imposes implementation effective dates beginning in 2010 and extending through 2020 and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the health care reform legislations mandate to purchase health insurance but struck down a provision allowing the federal government to withhold medicaid funds unless a state agrees to the expansion of medicaid eligibility therefore due to the phasedin nature of the implementation and the lack of interpretive guidance it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on our financial results possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be significant in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses which may cause a breach of loan covenants 

  

we have a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid seismic zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these risks we may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our assets financial condition and results of operation 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

  

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

  

currently we have two development communities and a second phase to an existing community under construction totaling 774  units as of december 31 2012  none of the units for the development projects have been completed as of december 31 2012  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

  

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

  

a change in united states government policy with regard to fnma and freddie mac could impact our financial condition 

  

on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress that included options among others to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fnma and freddie mac in august 2011 standard  poor’s rating services downgraded the credit ratings of fnma and freddie mac from aaa to aa we do not know when or if fnma or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2012  48  of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fnma or freddie mac with agency ratebased maturities ranging from 2013 through 2018 while the report to congress recognized the critically important role that fnma and freddie mac play in the housing finance market and committed to ensuring they have sufficient capital to perform under any guarantees issued now or in the future and the ability to meet any of their debt obligations should they be unable to meet their obligations it would have a material adverse effect on both us and the multifamily industry and we would seek alternative sources of funding which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all this could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps require us to post collateral up to the market value of the interest rate swaps and either of these occurrences could potentially cause a breach in one or more of our loan covenants and through reduced loan availability impact the value of multifamily assets which could impair the value of our properties 

  

our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions 

  

over the past several years domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty liquidity tightened in financial markets including the investment grade debt the cmbs commercial paper and equity capital markets we have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships between libor which is the basis for the majority of the payments to us by our swap counterparties and the actual interest rate we pay through the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs and the freddie mac reference bill programs this creates a risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past and it makes forecasting more difficult were our credit arrangements with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma or with financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac to fail or their ability to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired or cease we would have to seek alternative sources of capital which might not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition any such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise this could also cause our interest rate swaps and caps to become ineffective triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements if any of the foregoing events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects 

a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall to be in default of our loan covenants or to incur a charge for the impairment of assets 

  

we borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis certain of our debt agreements require us to post collateral and a significant reduction in the value of our assets could require us to post additional collateral while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity future asset values are uncertain if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility this would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants we may determine that the value of an individual asset or group of assets was irrevocably impaired and that we may need to record a charge to writedown the value of the asset to reflect its current value 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

  

at december 31 2012  we had total debt outstanding of 167 billion  payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or to pay distributions to shareholders that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we currently intend to limit our total debt to a range of approximately 43 to 48 of the undepreciated book value of our assets our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged we may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range covenants in our credit facilities limit our netdebt total debt less cash on hand to undepreciated book value to 60 as of december 31 2012  our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 44  in addition we must repay our debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates to refinance maturing debt could adversely affect our financial condition andor our funds from operations we rely on our lenders for our debt financing and have agreements with the lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject to revaluation annually the breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on our operations 

  

interest rate hedging may be ineffective 

  

we rely on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also rely on the agencies which provided credit or credit enhancement for a large portion of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2012  the debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma and financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac we pay fees to the credit facility providers and the agencies plus interest which is based on the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate 

  

the interest rate market for the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate both of which have been highly correlated with libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap and cap effectiveness in our experience the fnma dmbs rate has historically averaged 17  basis points below threemonth libor and the freddie mac reference bill rate has averaged 31  basis points below the associated libor rate but in the past 4 years the spreads increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically seen we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility over a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps and caps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet and potentially cause a breach of our debt covenants 

  

fluctuations in interest rate spreads between the dmbs and reference bill rates and threemonth libor causes ineffectiveness to flow through interest expense in the current period if we are in an overhedged position and together with the unrecognized ineffectiveness reduces the effectiveness of the swaps and caps 

  

we also rely on the credit of the counterparties that provide swaps and caps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities we use four major banks to provide approximately 95  of our derivative fair value all of which have investment grade ratings from moody’s and sp in the event that one of our derivative providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail our swaps or caps may become not effective in which case the value of the swap or cap would be recorded in earnings possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient to cause a breach of our debt covenants 

  

one or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default causing us significant financial exposure 

  

we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated a or above by standard  poors or aa3 or above by moody’s we also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties in the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade this 

could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or to lose the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay the swap counter party the net present value of the swap which may represent a significant current period cash charge possibly sufficient to cause us to breach our debt covenants 

  

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

  

at december 31 2012  effectively 79 million  of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps we may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to service our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders our 8842 million  secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma are predominately floating rate facilities we also have credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 2000 million  that are variable rate facilities at december 31 2012  a total of 8033 million  was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates we were exposed to at december 31 2012  large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps we will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates unless acceptable replacement swaps or caps or alternate fixed financings are obtainable 

  

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in increased debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

  

risks related to our organization and ownership of our stock 

  

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock 

  

our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred unless approved by our board of directors the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of our shares by value if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

  

 announcement 

  

  

the redemption price may be paid at our option by delivering one common unit subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of among other things stock splits stock dividends or recapitalizations affecting our common stock or certain mergers consolidations or asset transfers by us issued by our operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

  

 

provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

  

ownership limit 

  

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

  

preferred stock 

  

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock our board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2012  no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

  

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

  

as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

  

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

  

investments in joint ventures may involve risks that may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

  

 

although joint owners may have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares 

  

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down in addition although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange or the nyse the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries as a result our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

  

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

  

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to service our debt and to pay distributions to our shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 

  

the stock markets including the nyse on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our securities are the following 

  

 

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

  

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation 

  

if we failed to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

  

failure to make required distributions would subject us to income taxation 

  

in order to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition we would incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

  

 

differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

  

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities 

  

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

  

our common stock has been listed and traded on the nyse under the symbol “maa” since our initial public offering in february 1994 on february 4 2013  the reported last sale price of our common stock on the nyse was 6581  per share and there were approximately 1515  holders of record of the common stock we believe we have a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common stock the following table sets forth the quarterly high and low intraday sales prices of our common stock and the dividends declared by us with respect to the periods indicated 

  



1  generally our board of directors declares dividends prior to the quarter in which they are paid the dividend of 0695  per share declared in the fourth quarter of 2012  was paid on january 31 2013  to shareholders of record on january 15 2013  

  

our quarterly dividend rate is currently 0695  per common share our board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by us will be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the gross revenues received from the apartment communities our operating expenses the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures 

we expect to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by us will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 

  

we have established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in our operating partnership can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges in our absolute discretion we may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp we may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market we may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount 

  

in 2010  we issued a total of 568323  shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 20 for optional cash purchases in 2011  we issued a total of 509116  shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 20 for optional cash purchases in 2012  we issued a total of 14260  shares through our drspp and did not offer a discount for optional cash purchases

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets acquisition of real estate assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  

revenue recognition and real estate sales 

  

we lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

  

we record gains and losses on real estate sales in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate for sale transactions meeting the requirements for the full accrual method we remove the assets and liabilities from our consolidated balance sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes for properties contributed to joint ventures maa records gains on the partial sale in proportion to the outside partners’ interest in the venture 

  

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets 

  

we carry real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation and amortization is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 6 months for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred 

  

acquisition of real estate assets 

  

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets consisting of the value of inplace leases 

we allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land building and furniture fixtures and equipment determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of these assets management determines the asifvacant fair value of a 

property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers these methods include using stabilized noi and market specific capitalization and discount rates 

  

in allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit management concluded that the residential leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

  

longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of properties classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate we determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

  

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  

we utilize certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 

  

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter and have been found to be highly effective 

  

we measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method or the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

  

the valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market 

standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities   additionally we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements notes 5 and 6 for further discussion 

overview of the year ended december 31 2012   

  

we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2012  as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses the increases in revenues came from a 60  increase in our large market same store segment a 32  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 1654  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions the increase in expense came from a 29  increase in our large market same store segment a 14  increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 1411  increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily the result of acquisitions our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states we acquired eight  properties for our 100 owned portfolio in 2010  eleven  in 2011  and seven  in 2012  we also purchased two  properties through one of our joint ventures in 2010  and one  in 2011  we did not purchase any property through our joint ventures in 2012  offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were two  property dispositions in 2011  and nine  dispositions in 2012  we did not dispose of any properties in 2010  

  

as of december 31 2012  the total number of apartment units that we owned or had an ownership interest in was 49591  apartment units in 166  communities as compared to 49133  in 167  communities at december 31 2011  and 46310  apartment units in 157  communities at december 31 2010  in addition to the units listed above for the year ended december 31 2012  we had an additional 774  units at development properties that have not yet been delivered there were 950 such units at december 31 2011  and 428 units at december 31 2010  that had not yet been delivered for communities owned 100 by us the average effective monthly rent per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to  85571  at december 31 2012  from  79346  at december 31 2011  and  73651  at december 31 2010  for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  was 951  951  958  respectively 

average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2011  was approximately 421 million  an increase of 92 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  the majority of the increase was related to a onetime charge of 18 million  for an out of period adjustment to our restricted stock plans a 35 million  increase in stock incentives and a 14 million  increase in employee medical insurance the increase was also attributable to a 08 million  increase in property acquisition expenses due to higher acquisition volume for the year ended december 31 2011  

  

interest expense increased approximately 28 million  in 2011  from 2010  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from 2010  to 2011  of approximately 1276 million  

during the year ended december 31 2010  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately 19 million  related to one of our original initial public offering communities this community was part of our secondary market same store segment fair value of the community was determined by an offer no asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december 31 2011  

for the year ended december 31 2011  we recorded total gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately 128 million  there was no material gain loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31 2010  

  

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to midamerica apartment communities inc increased by approximately 191 million  in 2011  from 2010  

  

funds from operations 

  

funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items net income attributable to noncontrolling interest asset impairment gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

  

in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

  

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  dollars in thousands 



  

  1   in accordance with nareits current guidance ffo has been updated to exclude asset impairment write downs 

  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2012  increased approximately 408 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately 665 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 207 million  increase in property operating expenses 

  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2011  increased approximately 316 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately 503 million  discussed above that was only partially offset by the 190 million  increase in property operating expenses 

  

trends 

  

during 2012  rental demand for apartments continued to be strong as it was in 2011  this was evident through same store physical occupancy that was consistent with 2011  at nearly 96 on average for both years combined with steady price increases on both new leases and renewals signed throughout the year we have maintained this momentum with job formation one of the primary drivers of apartment demand continuing to increase at a below average pace 

  

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we believe that a well diversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets will perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better during 2012  we added an asset in the kansas city missouri market to our portfolio and exited the cincinnati ohio market as of december 31 2012  we were invested in approximately 50 markets with 59 of our gross assets in large markets and 41 of our gross assets in select secondary markets 

we also continued to benefit in 2012 on the supply side new supply of rental units entering the market was low running below historical new supply delivery averages multifamily permitting did pick up in 2012 but remained below peak levels we believe that this permitting will ultimately lead to an increase in supply competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets 

  

our focus throughout 2012  was increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system while maintaining strong physical occupancy through these efforts same store effective monthly rent per unit for the year was higher than 2011  by 5 with strong occupancy in place heading into the typically slower winter leasing season we were able to maintain pricing momentum in the fourth quarter of 2012  and expect seasonality to have less of an impact on pricing in the first quarter of 2013 

overall same store revenues increased 47 for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  as expected more robust revenue growth occurred in 2012  as rents continued the upward trend that began in the latter part of 2010  although new multifamily development is occurring the permitting data so far suggests that levels will remain below prerecession deliveries although there can be no assurance in this regard also we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages as evidenced by the recently announced “qualified mortgage rule” should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties long term we expect demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

should the economy fall back into a recession more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact to the multifamily sector to some degree but a weak economy and employment market would nevertheless limit rent growth prospects 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues the continued benefit of ancillary services such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to 2110 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  from 1723 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  this change was a result of various items including higher revenue as discussed above 

  

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 3292 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 4422 million  during the year ended december 31 2011 due to the following discussion in the year ended december 31 2012  we had acquisition cash outflows of 3120 million  compared to 3627 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  during 2012  we had cash outflows of 740 million  for development activities compared to 382 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  during 2012  we also had cash outflows of 144 million  for improvements to existing real estate assets compared to 127 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  the decrease in cash outflows from investing activities was offset by an increase in cash inflows from disposition activity during the year ended december 31 2012  we had cash inflows of approximately 1101 million  related to the sale of nine  properties in the year ended december 31 2011  we had cash inflows of 237 million  related to the sale of two  properties from our same store portfolio 

  

as of december 31 2012  we owned 39721461  common units comprising a 9582  general partnership interest in the operating partnership  while the remaining 1731672  outstanding common units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership holders of common units other than us and our affiliates may require us to redeem their common units from time to time in which case we may at our option pay the redemption price either in cash in an amount per common unit equal in general to the average closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date or by delivering one share of our common stock subject to adjustment under specified circumstances for each common unit so redeemed in addition we have registered the 1731672  shares of our common stock which as of december 31 2012  were issuable upon redemption of common units held by the operating partnerships limited partners under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets to the extent that additional common units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those common units under the securities act of 1933 as amended so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets if we issue shares of our common stock upon the redemption of common units in our operating partnership sales of substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities 

net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 700 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 2812 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  in the year ended december 31 2012  we had cash inflows of 3250 million  from proceeds of notes payable compared to 2854 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  in the year ended december 31 2012  we received proceeds of approximately 1963 million  primarily from the issuance of common stock through our atthemarket program or atm a waiver through our dividend and distribution reinvestment and share purchase plan or drspp and stock issued through a private offering during the year ended december 31 2011  we received proceeds of approximately 2357 million  primarily through these same programs in the year ended december 31 2012  we had cash outflows of 3201 million  from the net change in credit lines compared to 1215 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  

 on march 2 2012 we closed on an underwritten public offering of 1955000  shares of common stock ubs investment bank and jeffries  company inc acted as joint bookrunning managers this transaction resulted in net proceeds of 1201 million  no such issuances occurred during 2011 or 2010 

  

during 2012  we sold 1155511  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 759 million  through our atm this compares to 3303273  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 2045 million  for 2011  as of december 31 2012  there were 578015  shares outstanding under our atm 

  

during 2012  we issued 729  shares for net proceeds of 48000  through the direct stock purchase feature of our drspp however no discount was offered during 2011  we issued 495645  shares at an average discount of 2  for net proceeds of 300 million  through our drspp during 2010  we issued 551895  shares at an average discount of 2  through our drspp for net proceeds of 300 million  

  

on june 2 2010 we redeemed 3100001  shares of the 6200000  shares of our series h preferred stock for approximately 775 million  on august 5 2010 we redeemed all of the remaining and outstanding shares of series h for approximately 775 million  resulting in a combined writeoff for the year ended december 31 2010 of approximately 51 million  on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs there was no redemption of preferred stock during 2011  or 2012  

  

the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2012  for the 17 billion  of debt outstanding was 38  compared to the weighted average interest rate of 37  on 16 billion  of debt outstanding at december 31 2011  we utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as companywide secured and unsecured credit facilities we utilize fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section 

  

at december 31 2012  we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the fnma financial federal which are credit enhanced by the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a 325 million  bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks together these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of 14 billion  with all but 2823 million  collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2012  we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 8263 million  at december 31 2012  

  

approximately 36  of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2012  were borrowed through credit facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma also referred to as the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 8842 million  of which 6050 million  was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2012  we had total borrowings outstanding under the fnma facilities of approximately 6050 million  at december 31 2012  various fnma rate traunches of the fnma facilities mature from 2013 through 2018 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs rate which are creditenhanced by fnma and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating threemonth libor less a spread that has averaged 017  over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 049  to 067  we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and threemonth libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent 

  

approximately 12  of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2012  were borrowed through a credit facility withor credit enhanced by freddie mac also referred to as the freddie mac facility the freddie mac facility has a combined line limit of 2000 million  of which 1982 million  was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2012  we had total borrowings outstanding under the freddie mac facility of approximately 1982 million  at december 31 2012  the freddie mac facility matures in 2014 the interest rate on the freddie mac facility renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the freddie mac reference bill rate on the date of renewal which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90day 

libor plus a credit enhancement fee of 065  the freddie mac reference bill rate has traded consistently below libor and the historical average spread was 031  below libor at december 31 2012  

we also maintain a 3250 million  unsecured credit facility with nine banks led by keybank national association key bank the key bank credit line bears an interest rate of libor plus a spread of 105  to 185  based on an investment grade pricing grid this credit line expires in november 2015 with a one year extension option at december 31 2012  we had 3236 million  available to be borrowed under the key bank credit line agreement with 230 million  borrowed under this facility approximately 14 million  of the facility is used to support letters of credit 

  

each of our credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and the secured facilities are subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect our liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities a default on an obligation to repay outstanding debt could also create a cross default on a separate piece of debt whereby one or more of our lenders could accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing the related facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect 

  

on july 29 2011 we issued 135 million  of senior unsecured notes the notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity tranches 5000 million  at 47  maturing on july 29 2018 7275 million  at 54  maturing on july 29 2021 and 1225 million  at 56  maturing on july 29 2023 all of which is outstanding at december 31 2012  

on august 31 2012 we issued 175 million  of senior unsecured notes the notes were offered in a private placement with four tranches 1800 million  at 315  maturing on november 30 2017 2000 million  at 361  maturing on november 30 2019 11700 million  at 417  maturing on november 30 2022 and 2000 million  at 433  maturing on november 30 2024 all of which is outstanding at december 31 2012  

on march 1 2012  we entered into a 150 million  unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks led by key bank and jp morgan at a rate of libor plus a spread of 140  to 215  based on a leveraged based pricing grid and a maturity date of march 1 2017  we had borrowings of 150 million  outstanding under this agreement at december 31 2012  in july 2012 we received an investment grade rating baa2 from moodys pricing service which reduced the variable rate to libor plus a spread of 110  to 205  based on an investment grade ratings grid 

  

the following schedule details the line limits collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 

  



  

as of december 31 2012  we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 5590 million  to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges we had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 2885 million  as of december 31 2012

the following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2012  in thousands 



the following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2012  dollars in thousands 

we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations annual refurbishment of our properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and on rate renewals for fnma and freddie mac or the agencies the agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately 8033 million  of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of december 31 2012  

  

the interest rate markets for fnma dmbs and freddie mac reference bills which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a delegated underwriting and servicing dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us financial federal a freddie mac program plus lender and servicer is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between financial federal and us 

  

for the year ended december 31 2012  our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding of normal capital improvements to existing real estate assets distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 510 million  as compared to 281 million  and 168 million  for the same periods in 2011  and 2010  respectively while we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at december 31 2012  and 2011  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes midamerica multifamily fund i llc was established to acquire 500 million  of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2012  midamerica multifamily fund i llc owned two  properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities midamerica multifamily fund ii llc was established to acquire 250 million  of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2012  midamerica multifamily fund ii llc owned four  properties in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 12 

  

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

  

we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2012  we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation 

  

our resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable us to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation 

  

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  

in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  under asu 201302 an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts asu 201302 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements asu 201302 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 and early adoption is permitted we have early adopted asu 201302 for the annual period ended december 31 2012   the adoption of asu 201302 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 

in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income  this asu allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in both choices an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income asu 201105 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income asu 201105 is applied retrospectively the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 but allows for early adoption we adopted asu 201105 for the 

annual report for fiscal year 2011 and this changed the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 

  

in november 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201112 comprehensive income topic 220 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105  this asu supersedes certain paragraphs in asu 201105 addressing reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income the effective dates and expected changes to our presentation are the same as noted in asu 201105 above 

  

in may 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201104 fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  the amendments change the wording mainly for clarification used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements for many of the requirements the board does not intend for the amendments in this update to result in a change in the application of the requirements in topic 820 the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we have adopted asu 201104 in the interim and annual periods of fiscal year 2012 the adoption of asu 201104 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings at december 31 2012  37  of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix or cap the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings we use our best efforts to ladder fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes approximately 95  of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments at december 31 2012  we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our interest rate swaps and caps the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they expire weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date dollars in 000s

founded in 1994 midamerica apartment communities inc is a memphis tennesseebased selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit that focuses on acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states as of december 31 2011 we owned 100 of 160 properties representing 46872 apartment units three properties include retail components with approximately 93000 square feet of gross leasable area as of december 31 2011 we also had 3333 ownership interests in midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i and midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii which owned two properties containing 626 apartment units and five properties containing 1635 apartment units respectively these apartment communities were located across 13 states

 

our business is conducted principally through midamerica apartments lp which we refer to as our operating partnership we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 36602619 common units of partnership interest or common units comprising a 950 general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2011 unless the context otherwise requires all references in this annual report on form 10k to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “maa” refer collectively to midamerica apartment communities inc and its subsidiaries

 

our corporate offices are located at 6584 poplar avenue memphis tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is 901 6826600 as of december 31 2011 we had 1399 full time employees and 67 part time employees

 





 

financial information about segments 

  

as of december 31 2011 we owned or had an ownership interest in 167 multifamily apartment communities in 13 different states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments

 

  

  

  

on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons we utilize net operating income or noi in evaluating the performance total noi represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale we believe noi is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance

 

a summary of segment operating results for 2011 2010 and 2009 is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements note 13 additionally segment operating performance for such years is discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k

  

business objectives 

  

our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies

 





 

 

       operation strategy 

 

our goal is to maximize our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues tightly controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include

 

                 





  

decentralized operational structure 

 

we operate in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules which allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information we have also implemented revised utility billing processes rolled out new websites enabling online lease applications and improved webbased marketing programs

 

intensive property and asset management focus 

 

we have traditionally emphasized property management and over the past several years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and revenue management a majority of our property managers are certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals we also provide our own inhouse leadership development program consisting of an 18month threemodule program followed by two comprehensive case studies which was developed with the assistance of us learning inc

 

acquisition and joint venture strategy 

 

one of our growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities for our whollyowned portfolio that are diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states and that meet our investment criteria of expected leveraged returns exceeding our investment hurdle rate generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20 we have extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition we will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets

 

another of our growth strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for us at present we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old or older with younger acquisitions becoming part of the whollyowned portfolio





 

 

as of december 31 2011 we were partners in two joint ventures midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i and midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii

 

the following apartment communities were acquired during the year ended december 31 2011

 

  

  

  

disposition strategy 

 

at 16 years average age we have one of the younger portfolios in the multifamily reit sector and strive to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment from timetotime we dispose of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within our market area typically we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs from timetotime we also may dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above during 2011 we disposed of two properties totaling 534 units

 

  





  

  

development renovation and repositioning strategy 

 

periodically we invest in limited expansion development projects through fee based development agreements using fixed price construction contracts these contracts can have variability to cover any project cost overruns that may occur some development agreements require that cost overruns are contractually shared with the developer up to a specified level while other development agreements stipulate that cost overruns are the responsibility of the developer in october 2010 we purchased land in franklin nashville tennessee and entered into an agreement to develop a 428unit apartment community on the site construction began in late 2010 but no units were completed by the end of the 2011 during 2011 we also began developing a phase ii to the 1225 south church apartments in charlotte north carolina that were purchased in december 2010 in addition we purchased land in little rock arkansas during 2011 and entered into a development agreement to develop a 312unit apartment community on the site we are also under contract to purchase 107 acres of land and begin construction on a new 270unit community located in the charleston south carolina metropolitan area closing on the land and initial construction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2012while we seek opportunistic new development investments offering superior locations with attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties

 

beginning in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent during the year ended december 31 2011 we renovated 3118 units achieving a combined 96 rent increase above the normal renewal rate

 

capital structure strategy 

  

we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets focused on producing the overall lowest cost and most flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of each share of our common stock by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it can add to value per share in the past we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced

 

at december 31 2011 39 of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings including 36 for secured borrowings and 3 for unsecured borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels however our netdebt total debt less excess cash on hand to undepreciated book value is limited to 60 by our debt covenants we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within this target range as of december 31 2011 our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 46 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged but may decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders

  





 

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share recently we received a bbb credit rating from fitch as part of our strategy to access a broader financing market this rating supported our issuance of 135 million in senior unsecured notes and the opening of a 250 million unsecured credit facility we evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing refinancing or redeeming preferred stock as we did in 2010

 

we have entered into sales agreements with cantor fitzgerald  co raymond james  associates inc and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated to sell shares of our common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms 

 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these agreements through december 31 2011

 

 

 

we also have a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2011 we issued a total of 495645 shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan resulting in net proceeds of 300 million

 

 

share repurchase program 

  

in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2011 we had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2011 under this plan

  

  





  

  

competition 

  

all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities

  

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition we make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market

 

environmental matters

 

as part of the acquisition process we obtain environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems

 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral

 

we are aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold we have established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease we also have a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold therefore we believe that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled

 

the environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered a material environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents





 

 

we believe that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our shareholders annually as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and our property in 2011 we paid total distributions of 251 per common share to our shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement

  

recent developments

on january 12 2012 we closed on the sale of the 320unit kenwood club at the park apartment community located in katy houston texas resulting in a gain of approximately 96 million





 

 

on february 9 2012 we closed on the sale of the 276unit cedar mill apartment community located in memphis tennessee resulting in no material gain or loss

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock

 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

 

economic slowdown in the united states and downturns in the housing and real estate markets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

there have been significant declines in economic growth both in the united states and globally both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy have experienced unfavorable conditions which adversely affected our revenues although our industry and the united states economy showed signs of improvement in 2010 and 2011 we cannot accurately predict that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future or that our financial condition and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected factors such as weakened economies and related reduction in spending falling home prices and job losses price volatility andor dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our tenants and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants and other contracting parties which could adversely affect our revenues furthermore our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates or at all is adversely affected by increases in supply and deterioration in multifamily markets and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels downturns in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties the increasing rental of excess forsale condominiums and single family homes which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives may reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and depress rental rates in certain markets when we experience a downturn we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable but if the markets remain weak over extended periods of time or deteriorate significantly our ability to lease our properties or our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may weaken

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders 

 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include

 





 

 

              

at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

  

we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations 

  

the current united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate control executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us





 

 

certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area has culminated most recently in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable

 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the united states public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities

 

we are dependent on key personnel 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us

  

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

 

we intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties we must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability

  

we may not be able to sell communities when appropriate 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions further we own seven communities which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b taxfree exchange unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders





 

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity

 

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist

 

changes in the system for establishing united states accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations 

  

accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states or gaap gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board or fasb an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board or iasb is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards or ifrs ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world

 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation

 

the sec has proposed the mandatory adoption of ifrs by united states public companies possibly starting in 2015 it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain





 

 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations

  

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

 

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed

  

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should significantly rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected

  

we may experience increased costs arising from health care reform 

  

in march 2010 the united states government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which among other things includes guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates preexisting condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits the legislation imposes implementation effective dates beginning in 2010 and extending through 2020 and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations several states have challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the health care reform legislation and many of these challenges are still pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions including the united states supreme court therefore due to the phasedin nature of the implementation the lack of interpretive guidance and the pending court challenges to this legislation it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on our financial results possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

  





 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses which may cause a breach of loan covenants 

 

we have a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid seismic zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these risks we may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our assets financial condition and results of operation

 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

 

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial

  

development and construction risks could impact our profitability

 

currently we have two development communities and a second phase to an existing community under construction totaling 950 units as of december 31 2011 no units for the development projects were completed as of december 31 2011 our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

  

    





 

 

 

     

risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities 

  

a change in united states government policy with regard to fnma and freddie mac could seriously impact our financial condition 

 

on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress which included options among others to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fnma and freddie mac in august 2011 standard  poor’s rating services downgraded the credit ratings of fnma and freddie mac from aaa to aa we do not know when or if fnma or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2011 69 of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fnma or freddie mac with agency ratebased maturities ranging from 2012 through 2018 while the report to congress recognized the critically important role that fnma and freddie mac play in the housing finance market and committed to ensuring they have sufficient capital to perform under any guarantees issued now or in the future and the ability to meet any of their debt obligations should they be unable to meet their obligations it would have a material adverse effect on both us and the multifamily industry and we would seek alternative sources of funding this could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps require us to post collateral up to the market value of the interest rate swaps and either of these occurrences could potentially cause a breach in one or more of our loan covenants and through reduced loan availability impact the value of multifamily assets which could impair the value of our properties

  

our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions 

 

over the past three and a half years domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty liquidity tightened in financial markets including the investment grade debt the cmbs commercial paper and equity capital markets a large majority of apartment financing and as of december 31 2011 69 of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fnma and freddie mac which are now under the conservatorship of the united states government but for which on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress which included options to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fnma and freddie mac we have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships between libor which is the basis for the majority of the payments to us by our swap counterparties and the actual interest rate we pay through the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs and the freddie mac reference bill programs this creates a risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past and it makes forecasting more difficult were our credit arrangements with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma or with financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac to fail or their ability to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired or cease we would have to seek alternative sources of capital which might not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition any such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise this could also cause our interest rate swaps and caps to become ineffective triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements if any of the foregoing events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects





 

 

various agency ratebased traunches of our credit facilities with fnma and freddie mac mature from 2012 through 2018 and we anticipate that replacement financing whether with fnma freddie mac or other options in the financial markets will be at a higher cost

 

a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall to be in default of our loan covenants or to incur a charge for the impairment of assets 

 

we borrow on a secured basis from fnma freddie mac and on an unsecured basis from a syndicate of banks led by key bank a significant reduction in the value of our assets could require us to post additional collateral while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity future asset values are uncertain if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility this would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants we may determine that the value of an individual asset or group of assets was irrevocably impaired and that we may need to record a charge to writedown the value of the asset to reflect its current value

 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

 

at december 31 2011 we had total debt outstanding of 165 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or to pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we currently intend to limit our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels our netdebt to undepreciated book value is limited to 60 by our debt covenants as of december 31 2011 our ratio of netdebt to undepreciated book value was approximately 46 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition we must repay our debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect our financial condition andor our funds from operations we rely on fnma and freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and have agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject to revaluation annually the breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on our operations

 

interest rate hedging may be ineffective 

 

we rely on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also rely on the agencies which provided credit or credit enhancement for the majority of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2011 the debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma and financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac we pay fees to the credit facility providers and the agencies plus interest which is based on the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate

 





 

the interest rate market for the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate both of which have been highly correlated with libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap and cap effectiveness in our experience the fnma dmbs rate has historically averaged 16 basis points below threemonth libor and the freddie mac reference bill rate has averaged 32 basis points below the associated libor rate but in the past 3 years the spreads increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically seen we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility over a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps and caps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants

 

fluctuations in interest rate spreads between the dmbs and reference bill rates and threemonth libor causes ineffectiveness to flow through interest expense in the current period if we are in an overhedged position and together with the unrecognized ineffectiveness reduces the effectiveness of the swaps and caps

 

we also rely on the credit of the counterparties that provide swaps and caps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities we use four major banks to provide approximately 98 of our derivative fair value all of which have investment grade ratings from moody’s and sp in the event that one of our derivative providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail our swaps or caps may become not effective in which case the value of the swap or cap would be recorded in earnings possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient to cause a breach of one of our debt covenants

 

one or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default causing us significant financial exposure 

 

we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated a or above by standard  poors or aa3 or above by moody’s we also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties in the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade this could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or to lose the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay the swap counter party the net present value of the swap which may represent a significant current period cash charge possibly sufficient to cause us to breach one or more loan covenants

 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

 

at december 31 2011 effectively 249 million of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps we may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to shareholders our 964 million secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma are predominately floating rate facilities we also have credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 200 million that are variable rate facilities at december 31 2011 a total of 11 billion was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates we were exposed to at december 31 2011 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps we will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates unless acceptable replacement swaps or caps are obtainable

 





 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted

 

risks related to our organization and ownership of our stock 

 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock 

 

our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we

 

        

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above

 

    





  

provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

 

ownership limit 

 

the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors

 

preferred stock 

 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2011 no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding

 

tennessee antitakeover statutes 

 

as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests

 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

 

investments in joint ventures may involve risks that may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as

 

     

although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal

 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares 

 

the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down in addition although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange or the nyse the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares

 





 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to our shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares

 

the stock markets including the nyse on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

 

              





 

     

in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources

 

risks related to tax laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation 

 

if we failed to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit

  

failure to make required distributions would subject us to income taxation 

 

in order to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition we would incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of

 

    

differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year

 





  

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities 

 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

our common stock has been listed and traded on the nyse under the symbol “maa” since our initial public offering in february 1994 on february 3 2012 the reported last sale price of our common stock on the nyse was 6444 per share and there were approximately 1560 holders of record of the common stock we believe we have a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common stock the following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices of our common stock and the dividends declared by us with respect to the periods indicated

our quarterly dividend rate is currently 066 per common share our board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by us will be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the gross revenues received from the apartment communities our operating expenses the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures





 

 

we expect to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by us will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant

 

we have established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in our operating partnership can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges in our absolute discretion we may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp we may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market we may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount

 

in 2009 we issued a total of 25406 shares through our drspp and did not offer a discount for optional cash purchases in 2010 we issued a total of 568323 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 20 for optional cash purchases in 2011 we issued a total of 509116 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 20 for optional cash purchases

our business is conducted principally through midamerica apartments lp which we refer to as our operating partnership we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 33188063 common units of partnership interest or common units comprising a 938 general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2010 unless the context otherwise requires all references in this annual report on form 10k to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “maa” refer collectively to midamerica apartment communities inc and its subsidiaries 

our corporate offices are located at 6584 poplar avenue memphis tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is 901 6826600 as of december 31 2010 we had 1315 full time employees and 74 part time employees 

financial information about segments as of december 31 2010 we owned or had an ownership interest in 157 multifamily apartment communities in 13 different states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments 

   

 

 

on the first day of each calendar year we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year which allows us to evaluate full periodoverperiod operating comparisons we utilize net operating income or noi in evaluating the performance total noi represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses excluding depreciation for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale we believe noi is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance 

a summary of segment operating results for 2010 2009 and 2008 is included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements note 13 additionally segment operating performance for such years is discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

business objectives our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

      operation strategy our goal is to maximize our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues tightly controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

         

 

 

       decentralized operational structure we operate in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules which allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information we have also implemented revised utility billing processes rolled out new websites enabling online lease applications and improved webbased marketing programs 

intensive property and asset management focus we have traditionally emphasized property management and over the past several years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and revenue management a large majority of our property managers are certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals we also provide our own inhouse leadership development program consisting of an 18month threemodule program followed by two comprehensive case studies which was developed with the assistance of us learning inc 

acquisition and joint venture strategy one of our growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities for our whollyowned portfolio that are diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states and that meet our investment criteria of expected leveraged returns exceeding our investment hurdle rate generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20 we have extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition maa will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

another of our growth strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital 

 

 

diversification and lower investment risk for us at present we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old or older with younger acquisitions becoming part of the whollyowned portfolio 

as of december 31 2010 we were partners in two joint ventures midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i and midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii 

the following apartment communities were acquired during the year ended december 31 2010 



  disposition strategy we have one of the younger portfolios in the multifamily reit sector and strive to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment from timetotime we dispose of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within our market area typically we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs from timetotime we also may dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above we did not sell any apartment communities in 2010 

renovation repositioning and development strategy periodically we invest in limited expansion development projects using fixed price contracts in october 2010 we purchased land in franklin nashville tennessee and entered into an agreement to develop a 428unit apartment community on the site construction began in late 2010 but no units were completed by the end of the year during 2011 we also plan to begin developing a phase ii to the 1225 south church apartments in charlotte north carolina that were purchased in december 2010 while we seek opportunistic 

 

 

new development investments offering superior locations with attractive longterm investment returns we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way we expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties 

beginning in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we feel continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent during the year ended december 31 2010 we renovated 1760 units achieving a combined 106 rent increase above the normal renewal rate 

capital structure strategy we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets focused on producing the overall lowest cost and most flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of each share of our common stock by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it can add to value per share in the past we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

at december 31 2010 39 of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within this target range circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2010 our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 49 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged but may decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing refinancing or redeeming preferred stock as we did in 2010 

maa has entered into sales agreements with cantor fitzgerald  co raymond james  associates inc and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated to sell shares of maa’s common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs or atms 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these agreements through december 31 2010 



we also have a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 during the year ended december 31 2010 we issued a total of 551895 shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan resulting in net proceeds of 300 million 

 

 

on june 2 2010 we redeemed 3100001 shares of the 6200000 issued and outstanding shares of our 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series h on august 5 2010 we redeemed the remaining 3099999 shares of the issued and outstanding series h the series h shares were redeemed for a 25 per share redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the respective redemption date the redemptions were funded by proceeds through issuances of our common shares through our atm programs and dividend and distribution reinvestment and share purchase plan or drspp 

share repurchase program in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2010 midamerica had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include among others the share price financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2010 under this plan 

competition all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition we make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters as part of the acquisition process we obtain environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

we are aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold we have established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease we also have a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold therefore we believe that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

 

 

the environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

we believe that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

a change in united states government policy with regard to fnma and freddie mac could seriously impact our financial condition on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress which included options among others to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fnma and freddie mac we do not know when or if fnma or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular as of december 31 2010 85 of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fnma or freddie mac with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2018 while the report to congress recognized the critically important role that fnma and freddie mac play in the housing finance market and committed to ensuring they have sufficient capital to perform under any guarantees issued now or in the future and the ability to meet any of their debt obligations should they be unable to meet their obligations it would have a material adverse affect on both us and the multifamily industry and we would seek alternative sources of funding this could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps require us to post collateral up to the market value of the interest rate swaps and either of these occurrences could potentially cause a breach in one or more of our loan covenants and through reduced loan availability impact the value of multifamily assets which could impair the value of our properties 

economic slowdown in the united states and downturns in the housing and real estate markets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations significant declines in economic growth both in the united states and globally such that we have experienced since the second half of 2008 may impact our financial condition and results of operations recently both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy have experienced unfavorable conditions which adversely affected our revenues factors such as weakened economies and related reduction in spending falling home prices and job losses price volatility andor dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our tenants and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants and other contracting parties which could adversely affect our revenues furthermore our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates or at all is adversely affected by increases in supply and deterioration in multifamily markets and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels downturns in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties the increasing rental of excess forsale condominiums and single family homes which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives may reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and depress rental rates in certain markets when we experience a downturn we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable but if the markets remain weak over extended periods of time or deteriorate significantly our ability to lease our properties or our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may weaken 

 

 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

             at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions over the past two and a half years domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty liquidity tightened in financial markets including the investment grade debt the cmbs commercial paper and equity capital markets a large majority of apartment financing and as of december 31 2010 85 of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or creditenhanced by fnma and freddie mac which are now under the conservatorship of the united states government but for which on february 11 2011 the obama administration released a report to congress 

 

 

which included options to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fnma and freddie mac we have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships between libor which is the basis for the majority of the payments to us by our swap counterparties and the actual interest rate we pay through the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs and the freddie mac reference bill programs this creates a risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past and it makes forecasting more difficult were our credit arrangements with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma or with financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac to fail or their ability to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired or cease we would have to seek alternative sources of capital which might not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition any such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise this could also cause our interest rate swaps and caps to become ineffective triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements if any of the foregoing events were to occur it could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and prospects 

various traunches of our credit facilities with fnma and freddie mac mature from 2011 through 2018 and we anticipate that replacement facilities will be at a higher cost and have less attractive terms if available at all 

a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall to be in default of our loan covenants or to incur a charge for the impairment of assets we borrow on a secured basis from fnma freddie mac and regions bank a significant reduction in the value of our assets could require us to post additional collateral while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity future asset values are uncertain if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility this would have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants we may determine that the value of an individual asset or group of assets was irrevocably impaired and that we may need to record a charge to writedown the value of the asset to reflect its current value 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit at december 31 2010 we had total debt outstanding of 15 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or to pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we currently intend to limit our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2010 our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 49 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition we must repay our debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect our financial condition andor our funds from operations we rely on fnma and freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and have agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject to revaluation quarterly the breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on our operations 

interest rate hedging may be ineffective we rely on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also are heavily reliant on the agencies which provided credit or credit enhancement for the majority of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2010 the debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma and financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac we pay fees to the credit facility providers and the agencies plus interest which is based on the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate 

 

 

the interest rate market for the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate both of which have been highly correlated with libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap and cap effectiveness in our experience the fnma dmbs rate has historically averaged 16 basis points below threemonth libor and the freddie mac reference bill rate has averaged 34 basis points below the associated libor rate but in the past 3 years the spreads increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically seen we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility over a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps and caps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

fluctuations in interest rate spreads between the dmbs and reference bill rates and threemonth libor causes ineffectiveness to flow through interest expense in the current period if we are in an overhedged position and together with the unrecognized ineffectiveness reduces the effectiveness of the swaps and caps 

we also rely on the credit of the counterparties that provide swaps and caps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities we use four major banks to provide approximately 95 of our derivative fair value all of which have high investment grade ratings from moody’s and sp in the event that one of our derivative providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail our swaps or caps may become ineffective in which case the value of the swap or cap would be adjusted to fair value in the current period possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient to cause a breach of one of our debt covenants 

one or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default causing us significant financial exposure we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated a or above by standard  poors or aa3 or above by moody’s we also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties in the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade this could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or to lose the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay the swap counter party the net present value of the swap which may represent a significant current period cash charge possibly sufficient to cause us to breach one or more loan covenants 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations at december 31 2010 effectively 228 million of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps we may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to shareholders our 10 billion secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma are predominately floating rate facilities we also have credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 300 million that are variable rate facilities at december 31 2010 a total of 13 billion was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates we were exposed to at december 31 2010 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps we will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates unless acceptable replacement swaps or caps are obtainable 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

 

 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses and may cause a breach of loan covenants we have a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid seismic zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these risks we may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our assets financial condition and results of operation 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

we are dependent on key personnel our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies we intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties we must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

we may not be able to sell communities when appropriate real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions further we own seven communities which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b taxfree exchange unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without 

 

 

regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 

some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

       if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

   provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us ownership limit the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

 

 

preferred stock our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests as of december 31 2010 no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks investments in joint ventures may involve risks that may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

    although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down in addition although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to our shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange or nyse on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in 

 

 

the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

                 in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation if we failed to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

 

 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

failure to make required distributions would subject us to income taxation in order to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition we would incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

   differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

 our quarterly dividend rate is currently 06275 per common share our board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by us will be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the gross revenues received from the apartment communities our operating expenses the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures 

we expect to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by us will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 

we have established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in our operating partnership can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges in our absolute discretion we may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp we may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market we may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount 

 

 

in 2008 we issued a total of 421794 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases in 2009 we issued a total of 25406 shares through our drspp and did not offer a discount for optional cash purchases in 2010 we issued a total of 568323 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 20 for optional cash purchases

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

revenue recognition we lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

we record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets we carry real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 6 months for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred 

development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost real estate taxes and personnel expense 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on longlived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the 

 

 

carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate we determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments we utilize certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter and have been found to be highly effective 

we measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

the valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities additionally we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements notes 5 and 6 

overview of the year ended december 31 2010 we experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations in 2010 as increases in revenues were more than offset by increases in expenses the increases in revenues came from a 25 increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 664 increase in our nonsame store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions the increase in expenses included a 16 million increase in acquisition costs related to increased acquisition activity in 2010 our same store portfolio represents those communities 

 

 

that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states we acquired five properties for our 100 owned portfolio in 2008 four in 2009 and eight in 2010 we also purchased two properties through our joint venture in 2008 two in 2009 and two in 2010 offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were three property dispositions in 2009 

we continued to benefit from reduced interest rates in 2010 as a reduction in average interest rates more than offset the impact from an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 

as of december 31 2010 the total number of apartment units that maa owned or had an ownership interest in was 46310 in 157 communities compared to 43604 apartment units in 147 communities at december 31 2009 and 42554 apartment units in 145 communities at december 31 2008 for communities owned 100 by maa the average effective rent per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to 73651 at december 31 2010 from 715 at december 31 2009 and 750 at december 31 2008 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 958 952 and 934 respectively 

average effective rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units divided by the total number of units leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate we believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations comparison of the year ended december 31 2010 to the year ended december 31 2009 property revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were approximately 4015 million an increase of 233 million from the year ended december 31 2009 due to i a 43 million increase in property revenues from our secondary market same store group primarily as a result of a 37 million increase from our new bulk cable program and ii a 190 million increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel property personnel bonuses building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and depreciation property operating expenses excluding depreciation for the year ended december 31 2010 were approximately 1746 million an increase of approximately 149 million from the year ended december 31 2009 due primarily to increases in property operating expenses of i 26 million from our large market same store group ii 40 million from our secondary market same store group and iii 83 million from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions the increases in the large and secondary market same store groups include 28 million and 37 million respectively related to the accounting for our new bulk cable program 

depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was approximately 1041 million an increase of approximately 80 million from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the increases in depreciation expense of i 10 million from our large market same store group ii 13 million from our secondary market same store group and iii 57 million from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions increases of depreciation expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business 

 

 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was approximately 560 million a decrease of 11 million from the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease was primarily related to the decrease in our average cost of debt from 431 for the year ended december 31 2009 to 395 for the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in our average cost of debt was partially offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2010 of approximately 882 million 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately 19 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities this community is part of our secondary market same store segment fair value of the community was determined by an offer no asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to midamerica apartment communities inc decreased by approximately 75 million in the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 

during 2010 we redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of the 6200000 shares of our 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series h resulting in a writeoff of approximately 51 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs the redemption also resulted in the decrease of preferred dividends from 129 million for the year ended december 31 2009 to 65 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2008 property revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by approximately 84 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due to i a 01 million increase in property revenues from our large market same store group and ii a 93 million increase in property revenues from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of approximately 10 million from our secondary market same store group 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by approximately 44 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 03 million from our secondary market same store group and ii 43 million from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the property operating expenses of 02 million from our large same store group due primarily to real estate tax expense which reflected the favorable impact of successful prior year appeals and assessment challenges 

depreciation expense increased by approximately 59 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 14 million from our large market same store group ii 10 million from our secondary market same store group and iii 35 million from our nonsame store and other group mainly as a result of acquisitions increases of depreciation expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business 

interest expense decreased approximately 49 million in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 488 in 2008 to 431 in 2009 this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately 349 million from 2008 to 2009 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded total gains of approximately 46 million from the sale of three communities we had no property dispositions in 2008 

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to midamerica apartment communities inc increased by approximately 70 million in 2009 from 2008 

 

 

funds from operations funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gains on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 dollars and shares in thousands 



ffo for the year ended december 31 2010 increased approximately 53 million from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately 233 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the 149 million increase in property operating expenses ffo for the year ended december 31 2010 was impacted by a 19 million asset impairment charge related to one of our original initial public offering communities ffo for the year ended december 31 2010 was also impacted by a decrease in preferred dividends of 63 million from the year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

due to the redemption of the series h shares this decrease was materially offset by the recognition of approximately 51 million on the consolidated statements of operations representing the writeoff of premiums and original issuance costs for the series h redemption 

ffo for the year ended december 31 2009 increased approximately 69 million from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately 84 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the 44 million increase in property operating expenses 

trends during 2010 rental demand for apartments began to improve relative to 2009 this was evident through higher physical occupancy as compared to 2009 as well as pricing increases on both new leases and renewals signed during the year however we have maintained this momentum with job formation one of the primary drivers of apartment demand continuing to be slow to return the job losses that have occurred across the nation and our markets continue to cause us to be cautious about apartment demand and pricing but optimistic about the long term prospects for apartment demand as job growth returns 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we have found that a well diversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets has tended to perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better as of december 31 2010 with the addition of an asset in charlotte north carolina we were invested in over 49 separate markets with 62 of our gross assets in large markets and 38 of our gross assets in select secondary markets 

we also continue to benefit on the supply side supply declined in 2010 and continues to run well below historical new supply delivery averages competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets we expect this relative new supply compression to be an even larger factor over the next several quarters as supply that did come to market before the slowdown moves further away from the lease up stage and new supply remains limited 

our focus throughout 2010 was on maintaining strong occupancy performance and pushing pricing where possible through our revenue management system through these efforts our average same store occupancy large market same store and secondary market same store segments combined in 2010 was about 80 basis points higher than the average for 2009 while effective rent per unit for the year was lower than 2009 primarily due to in place rents going into 2010 we saw the pricing trend reverse and turn positive in 2010 in the third quarter of 2010 we saw the first sequential quarter increase in effective rents in seven quarters this pricing trend is expected to continue in 2011 

overall same store revenues increased 12 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this included an increase of 65 million due to our new bulk cable program with cable expense netted into cable revenues same store revenues decreased 06 over this period as expected the quarter over quarter decline in same store revenue reversed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and turned positive as rents continued to rebound from declines seen in 2009 and early 2010 we expect more robust revenue growth will resume in 2011 as the economic growth returns and most importantly when sustainable job growth resumes we also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment construction over the next few quarters and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties at the same time we expect longterm demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

 

 

should the economy fall into a deeper recession the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact to some degree but a weak economy and employment market would nevertheless limit rent growth prospects 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues the continued rollout of ancillary services such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

throughout 2010 we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from a continued strong market for federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation debt securities short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels and as a result we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves 

liquidity and capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to 1338 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 1403 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this change was a result of various items including changes in cash flows associated with the timing of interest payments 

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 2543 million during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 1540 million during the year ended december 31 2009 mainly related to acquisition activity in the year ended december 31 2010 maa had acquisition cash outflows of 2840 million compared to 1253 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in cash outflows due to acquisitions was partially offset primarily by an increase in cash inflows from disposition activity in the year ended december 31 2010 we had cash inflows of 903 million mainly related to the contributions of three communities to fund ii during the year ended december 31 2009 we had cash inflows of approximately 299 million mainly related to the sale of three communities 

net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 1526 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 181 million during the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2010 we received proceeds of approximately 3055 million primarily from the issuance of shares of common stock through our atthemarket program or atm and a waiver through our dividend and distribution reinvestment and share purchase plan or drspp we used 1550 million of these proceeds to fund the redemption of our 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series h 

during 2010 maa sold 5077201 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 2746 million through our atm this compares to 763000 shares for net proceeds of approximately 328 million for 2009 and 1955300 shares for net proceeds of approximately 1036 million for 2008 

during 2010 maa issued 551895 shares at an average discount of 2 for net proceeds of 300 million through the direct stock purchase feature of our drspp during 2009 maa did not offer a discount through our drspp and issued approximately 1100 shares of common stock generating approximately 39000 in proceeds during 2008 maa offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 403000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of the plan generating approximately 20 million in proceeds 

on june 2 2010 we redeemed 3100001 shares of the 6200000 shares of our series h for approximately 775 million on august 5 2010 we redeemed all of the remaining and outstanding shares of series h for approximately 775 million resulting in a combined writeoff for the year ended december 31 2010 of approximately 51 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs the redemption also resulted in the decrease of preferred dividends to 65 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 129 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2010 for the 15 billion of debt outstanding was 38 compared to the weighted average interest rate of 40 on 14 billion of debt outstanding at december 31 2009 we utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as companywide secured credit facilities we utilize fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section 

at december 31 2010 we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association or fnma financial federal which are credit enhanced by the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a 50 million bank facility with a syndicate of banks together these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of 14 billion with all but 65 million collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2010 we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 13 billion at december 31 2010 

approximately 65 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2010 were borrowed through credit facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma also referred to as the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 104 billion all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2010 we had total borrowings outstanding under the fnma facilities of approximately 097 billion at december 31 2010 various traunches of the fnma facilities mature from 2011 through 2018 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs rate which are creditenhanced by fnma and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating threemonth libor less a spread that has averaged 016 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 049 to 067 we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and threemonth libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent 

approximately 20 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2010 were borrowed through credit facilities withor credit enhanced by freddie mac also referred to as the freddie mac facilities the freddie mac facilities have a combined line limit of 300 million of which 298 million was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2010 we had total borrowings outstanding under the freddie mac facilities of approximately 298 million at december 31 2010 the freddie mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014 the interest rate on the freddie mac facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the freddie mac reference bill rate on the date of renewal which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90day libor plus a credit enhancement fee of 065 to 069 the freddie mac reference bill rate has traded consistently below libor and the historical average spread was 034 below libor at december 31 2010 

each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and is subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect our liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect 

the following schedule details the line limits collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 7348 million to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges we had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 2707 million as of december 31 2010 

the following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps outstanding as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



  the following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



the following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements and fixed rate debt as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



 

 

we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations annual refurbishment of our properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and on fnma and freddie mac or the agencies the agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately 13 billion of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of december 31 2010 

the interest rate markets for fnma dmbs and freddie mac reference bills which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us financial federal a freddie mac program plus lender and servicer is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between financial federal and us 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 105 million as compared to 102 million and 127 million for the same periods in 2009 and 2008 respectively while we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate 

the following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our longterm debt and operating leases as of december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 



   offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2010 and 2009 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes our two joint ventures with crow holdings one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007 were established to acquire approximately 200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income midamerica multifamily fund i llc was established to acquire 500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2010 midamerica multifamily fund i llc owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities midamerica multifamily fund ii llc was established to acquire 250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2010 midamerica multifamily fund ii llc owned four properties in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements note 12 

 

 

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2010 we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable maa to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation

 item 1 business overview founded in 1994 midamerica apartment communities inc is a memphis tennesseebased selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit that focuses on acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states as of december 31 2009 we owned 100 of 144 properties representing 42684 apartment units as of december 31 2009 we also had 3333 ownership interests in midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i and midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii which owned two properties containing 626 apartment units and one property containing 294 apartment units respectively these apartment communities were located across 13 states 

our business is conducted principally through midamerica apartments lp which we refer to as our operating partnership we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 297176 common units of partnership interest or common units comprising a 1 general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2009 midamerica apartment communities inc’s whollyowned qualified reit subsidiary mac ii of delaware inc is a limited partner in the operating partnership and as of december 31 2009 held 27114739 common units or 9124 of all outstanding common units unless the context otherwise requires all references in this annual report on form 10k to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “midamerica” refer collectively to midamerica apartment communities inc and its subsidiaries 

our corporate offices are located at 6584 poplar avenue memphis tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is 901 6826600 as of december 31 2009 we had 1204 full time employees and 78 part time employees 

financial information about segments as each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics residents and products and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

business objectives our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner to achieve these objectives we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

      

 

 

operation strategy our goal is to maximize our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues tightly controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

                decentralized operational structure we operate in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations to maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis we utilize a webbased property management system the system contains property and accounting modules which allow for operating efficiencies continued expense control provide for various expanded revenue management practices and improve the support provided to onsite property operations we use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and 

 

 

management information we have also implemented revised utility billing processes rolled out new websites enabling online lease applications and improved webbased marketing programs 

intensive property and asset management focus we have traditionally emphasized property management and over the past several years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and most recently revenue management a large majority of our property managers are certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals we also provide our own inhouse leadership development program consisting of an 18month threemodule program followed by two comprehensive case studies which was developed with the assistance of us learning inc 

acquisition strategy one of our growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states that meet our investment criteria when the expected leveraged returns exceed our investment hurdle rate generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20 we have extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition midamerica will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets 

the following apartment communities were purchased during 2009 



 disposition strategy we have one of the younger portfolios in the multifamily reit sector and strive to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment from timetotime we dispose of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within our market area typically we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs from timetotime we also may dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above 

 

 

the following apartment communities were sold during 2009 



renovation repositioning and development strategy in 2006 we began some limited expansion development projects on adjacent land to existing apartment communities using fixed price contracts in 2009 we completed construction on these projects we do not currently have any additional development projects planned nor intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way we prefer to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new properties 

beginning in 2005 we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio we focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we feel continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent as of december 31 2009 we have renovated 9090 units achieving a combined 12 rent increase above the normal renewal rate 

joint venture strategy one of our strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for us at present we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old or older with younger acquisitions becoming part of the whollyowned portfolio 

as of december 31 2009 we were partners in two joint ventures midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i and midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii 

capital structure strategy we use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets focused on producing the overall lowest cost and most flexible capital structure we focus on improving the net present value of each share of our common stock by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital we routinely make new investments when we believe it can add to value per share in the past we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

at december 31 2009 46 of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings we currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels we may issue new equity to maintain our debt within this target range circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2009 our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 50 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged but may decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

common and preferred stock we continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value we also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities 

 

 

selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock 

on november 3 2006 midamerica entered into a sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co to sell up to 2000000 shares of midamerica’s common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity offering program in july 2008 we entered into a second controlled equity offering sales agreement with similar terms authorizing the sale of up to 1350000 shares of common stock 

the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these agreements through december 31 2009 



in november 2009 we entered into a third controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co with similar terms authorizing the sale of up to 4000000 shares of common stock no sales were made under this agreement as of december 31 2009 

in october 2007 we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock for 119 million 

we also have a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 throughout 2009 we issued a total of 1100 shares through the direct stock purchase plan we did not offer a discount during 2009 nor grant any waivers during 2009 

share repurchase program in 1999 our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2009 midamerica had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to sell assets based on our disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2009 under this plan 

competition all of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition we make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

 

 

environmental matters as part of the acquisition process we obtain environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

we are aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold we have established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease we have also purchased a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2010 but is renewable at that time therefore we believe that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

the environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities we are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

we believe that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

qualification as a real estate investment trust we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our shareholders annually as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and our property in 2009 we declared total distributions of 246 per common share to our shareholders which was above the 90 reit distribution requirement 

recent developments dispositions on january 28 2010 midamerica apartments lp sold legacy at western oaks to fund ii one of our joint ventures for tax purposes this transaction was considered a contribution 




 item 1a risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations if any of these risks occur our business results of operations or financial condition could suffer the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 

economic slowdown in the united states and the related downturn in the housing and real estate markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations there has been a significant decline in economic growth both in the united states and globally in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 the trends in both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy continue to be unfavorable and continue to adversely affect our revenues the weakened economy and related reduction in spending falling home prices and mounting job losses together with the price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our tenants and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants and other contracting parties which could adversely affect our revenues furthermore our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates or at all is adversely affected by the increase in supply and deterioration in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels the downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties the increasing rental of excess forsale condominiums and single family homes which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives may further reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and further depress rental rates in certain markets we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable but if the markets remain weak or deteriorate further our ability to lease our properties our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may continue to weaken during 2010 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements andor to have 

 

 

access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

            at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions recently domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty liquidity has tightened in financial markets including the investment grade debt the cmbs commercial paper and equity capital markets a large majority of apartment financing and as of december 31 2009 93 of our outstanding debt is provided by or creditenhanced by fnma and freddie mac which are now under the conservatorship of the us government we have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships between libor which is the basis for the majority of the payments to us by our swap counterparties and the actual interest rate we pay through the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs and the freddie mac reference bill programs which we believe to be temporary this creates a risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past and it makes forecasting more difficult were our credit arrangements with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma or with financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac to fail or their ability 

 

 

to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired we would have to seek alternative sources of capital which might not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition any such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise this could also cause our swaps to become ineffective triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements if any of the foregoing events were to occur it could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and prospects 

various traunches of our credit facilities with fnma and freddie mac mature from 2011 through 2018 and we anticipate that replacement facilities will be at a higher cost and have less attractive terms if available at all 

a change in us government policy with regard to fnma and freddie mac could seriously impact our financial condition the us government has committed preferred equity to fnma and freddie mac placing them in conservatorship and the treasury department increased fnma and freddie mac’s portfolio caps which are required to be reduced over time through expansion of their offbalance sheet lending products which form the large majority of our borrowing we believe that fnma and freddie mac balance sheet limitations will not restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry and to us in particular statements supporting their involvement in apartment lending by the heads of multifamily lending of fnma freddie mac and their regulator have been reiterated should this support change it would have a material adverse affect on both us and the multifamily industry and we would seek alternative sources of funding this could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps require us to post collateral up to the value of the interest rate swaps and either of these occurrences could potentially cause a breach in one or more of our loan covenants and through reduced loan availability impact the value of multifamily assets which could impair the value of our properties 

a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall be in default of our loan covenants or incur a charge for the impairment of assets we borrow on a secured basis from fnma freddie mac and regions bank a significant reduction in the value of our assets could require us to post additional collateral while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity future asset values are uncertain if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility this would have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants we may determine that the value of an individual asset or group of assets was irrevocably impaired and that we may need to record a charge to writedown the value of the asset to reflect its current value 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit at december 31 2009 we had total debt outstanding of 14 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we currently intend to limit our total debt to a range of approximately 45 to 55 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2009 our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 50 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition we must repay our debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect our financial condition andor our funds from operations we rely on fnma and freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and have agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject to revaluation quarterly the breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on our operations 

interest rate hedging may be ineffective we rely on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also are heavily reliant on the agencies which provide credit or credit enhancement for approximately 13 billion of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2009 the debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with prudential mortgage 

 

 

capital creditenhanced by fnma and financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac we pay fees to the credit facility providers and the agencies plus interest which is based on the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate the agencies have been placed into conservatorship by the us government under the supervision of the federal housing finance agency which has committed 200 billion of capital to each if needed 

the interest rate market for the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate both of which have been highly correlated with libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness in our experience the fnma dmbs rate has historically averaged 16 basis points below threemonth libor and the freddie mac reference bill rate has averaged 40 basis points below the associated libor rate but in the past 28 months the spreads increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically seen before recently contracting closer to more normal levels we believe that the current market illiquidity is an anomaly and that the spreads and the volatility will return to more stable historic levels but we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility over a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

fluctuations in interest rate spreads between the dmbs and reference bill rates and threemonth libor causes ineffectiveness to flow through interest expense in the current period if in an overhedged position and together with the unrecognized ineffectiveness reduces the effectiveness of the swaps 

we also rely on the credit of the counterparties that provide swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities we use three major banks to provide nearly 80 of our swaps jp morgan chase royal bank of canada and deutsche bank all of which have high investment grade ratings from moody’s and sp in the event that one of our swap providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail our swaps may become ineffective in which case the value of the swap would be adjusted to value in the current period possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient to cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

one or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default causing us significant financial exposure we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated generally aa or above by standard  poors or aa3 or above by moody’s we also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties in the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade this could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or lose the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay the swap counter party the net present value of the swap which may represent a significant current period cash charge possibly sufficient to cause us to breach one or more loan covenants 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations at december 31 2009 effectively 263 million of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps we may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to shareholders our 10 billion secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma were predominately floating rate facilities during 2009 we also have credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 300 million that are variable rate facilities at december 31 2009 a total of 13 billion was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates we were exposed to at december 31 2009 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps we will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we 

 

 

exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses and may cause a breach of loan covenants we have a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid seismic zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these risks we may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our assets financial condition and results of operation 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we are dependent on key personnel our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies we intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties we must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

we may not be able to sell communities when appropriate real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions further we own seven communities which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b taxfree exchange unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances 

 

 

or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 

some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

         if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

   

 

 

provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us ownership limit the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests currently we have 6200000 shares of 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks investments in joint ventures may involve risks that may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

    although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares as a percentage of the price of the shares relative to market interest rates if market interest rates increase prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate higher interest rates would not however result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down in addition although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries as a result our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares we believe that the market value of a reit’s equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our 

 

 

common shares in addition we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to our shareholders our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange nyse on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

               in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation if we failed to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

 

 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

failure to make required distributions would subject us to income taxation in order to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition we will incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

   differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

revenue recognition we lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

we record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets we carry real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 6 months for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred 

development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on longlived assets and evaluate goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

 

 

longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate we determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments we utilize certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while our calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedge are measured by us before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

we measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

the valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities additionally we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

overview of the year ended december 31 2009 we experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations before nonoperating items in 2009 as the increases in revenues from new acquisitions and renovation projects were more than offset by the decrease in revenues from our same store portfolio of 12 over 2008 our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations 

we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states we acquired four properties in 2007 five properties in 2008 and four properties in 2009 we also purchased one property through a joint venture in 2009 and two properties in 2008 offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were five property dispositions in 2007 one of which was through a joint venture and three property dispositions in 2009 

we benefited from reduced interest expense in 2009 as our twelve month average interest rate dropped from 49 in 2008 to 43 in 2009 

as of december 31 2009 the total number of apartment units midamerica owned or had an ownership interest in was 43604 in 147 communities compared to 42554 apartment units in 145 communities at december 31 2008 and 40248 apartment units in 137 communities at december 31 2007 for communities owned 100 by midamerica the average effective rent per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup decreased to 715 at december 31 2009 from 750 at december 31 2008 and 737 at december 31 2007 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 952 934 and 947 respectively 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

results of operations comparison of the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2008 property revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by approximately 84 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due to i a 26 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2009 or the 2009 acquisitions ii a 71 million increase in property revenues from the five properties acquired in 2008 or the 2008 acquisitions and iii a 25 million increase in property revenues from our development communities these increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of 38 million from the properties held throughout both periods the decrease in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was due primarily to midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by a 22 decrease in average effective rent per unit in 2009 over 2008 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by approximately 44 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 12 million from the 2009 acquisitions ii 28 million from the 2008 acquisitions and iii 09 million from our development communities these increases were partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of 05 million from the properties held throughout both periods the decrease in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods was due primarily to midamerica’s same store portfolio and represented real estate tax expense which reflected the favorable impact of successful prior year appeals and assessment challenges 

depreciation expense increased by approximately 59 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 06 million from the 2009 acquisitions ii 21 million from the 2008 acquisitions iii 07 million from our development communities and iv 35 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 10 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired 

interest expense decreased approximately 49 million in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 49 in 2008 to 43 in 2009 this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately 349 million from 2008 to 2009 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded total gains of approximately 46 million from the sale of three communities we had no property dispositions in 2008 

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to midamerica apartment communities inc increased by approximately 70 million in 2009 from 2008 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2007 property revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by approximately 224 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due to i a 72 million increase in property revenues from the 2008 acquisitions ii a 58 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007 or the 2007 acquisitions iii a 17 million increase in property revenues from our development communities and iv a 77 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by our same store portfolio and was driven by a 18 increase in average effective rent per unit in 2008 over 2007 

property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by approximately 129 million from the year ended december 31 2007 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 35 million from the 2008 acquisitions ii 29 million from the 2007 acquisitions iii 08 million from our development communities and iv 57 million from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property 

 

 

operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of our same store portfolio and represented an average 35 increase over prior year expenses and included 591000 of expense related to hurricane ike 

depreciation expense increased by approximately 54 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 23 million from the 2008 acquisitions ii 16 million from the 2007 acquisitions iii 03 million from our development communities and iv 30 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 18 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired 

property management expenses decreased by approximately 11 million from the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2008 due to decreased incentive compensation general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 10 million over this same period mainly as a result of increased personnel costs 

interest expense decreased approximately 16 million in 2008 from 2007 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 54 in 2007 to 49 in 2008 this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately 838 million from 2007 to 2008 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded total gains of approximately 54 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture the sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to us of approximately 10 million in 2007 in 2007 we also benefited from a 92 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by us we had no property dispositions in 2008 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling 11 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a loss of 03 million for these same items 

primarily as a result of the foregoing net income attributable to midamerica apartment communities inc decreased by approximately 97 million in 2008 from 2007 

funds from operations funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gains on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

 

 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to consolidated net income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 dollars and shares in thousands 



ffo increases for both 2009 over 2008 and 2008 over 2007 benefited from the addition of communities from the 2007 acquisitions 2008 acquisitions and 2009 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above the ffo increase for 2008 over 2007 also benefited from improved community operations from our same store portfolio 

trends during 2009 rental demand for apartments was weaker in most of our markets when compared to 2008 one of the primary drivers of apartment demand is job formation and the job losses across our markets impacted apartment demand and pricing however relative job losses in 2009 for our markets combined were less than the national average 

an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area we have found that a well diversified portfolio including both large and select secondary markets has tended to perform well in “up” cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better at the end of 2009 we were invested in over 48 separate markets with 59 of our gross assets in large markets and 41 of our gross assets in select secondary markets 

partially mitigating the severe job losses in 2009 was lower resident turnover primarily due to fewer moveouts from buying homes the primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house in 2009 we saw both the number and the percent of total moveouts due to home buying drop as compared to 2008 according to the census bureau homeownership increased from 65 to 69 of households over the ten years ending 2005 despite the tightened credit market in 2009 the home ownership rate was still in the 67 to 68 range the increase from historical levels was driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products many requiring no downpayment and minimal credit ratings with a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards it is possible that a longterm correction will occur and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels this could be quite significant for the apartment business and we believe if this occurs it could benefit us for several years 

we also benefited on the supply side as supply declined from 2008 and ran below historical new supply delivery averages competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in our markets because most of our markets and submarkets 

 

 

have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we saw significant rental competition from condominiums andor single family houses in only a few submarkets we expect this relative new supply compression to be an even larger factor over the next several quarters as supply is expected to contract even further 

our focus during 2009 was on sustaining occupancy as we operated in a weaker leasing market by focusing on aggressive efforts to build and sustain traffic and pricing aggressively we were largely successful at this as our same store occupancy ended the year 170 basis points over yearend 2008 and dropped only 90 basis points from the record levels of the quarter ended september 30 2009 despite the normal seasonal decline in traffic 

overall same store revenues decreased 12 compared to 2008 we believe that the decline in same store revenue will continue into 2010 primarily due to the impact of lower rents on leases signed in the latter half of 2009 however revenue growth should resume after the economic growth returns and most importantly when job growth resumes which some economists project could be as soon as the middle to latter part of 2010 we also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment supply and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties at the same time we expect longterm demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

while expected continued weak employment growth is expected to keep new demand subdued we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive and that positive absorption of apartments will return for most of our markets later in 2010 should the economy fall into a deeper recession the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact 

we continue to develop improved products operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues the continued rollout of ancillary services such as reselling cable television improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses such as new websites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively 

during 2009 we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from an improved market for federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation debt securities much of this was due to government action to improve liquidity in the credit markets and resulted in a lower cost of debt for us short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels and as a result we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves 

liquidity and capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 10 million to 1369 million for 2009 compared to 1379 million for 2008 mainly related to the decrease in rental rates from 2008 to 2009 net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 193 million to 1379 million for 2008 compared to 1186 million for 2007 mainly related to our growth through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2008 

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 1505 million 2430 million and 1088 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity a total of approximately 1253 million was invested in 2009 to acquire properties this compares to approximately 1563 million in 2008 and 886 million in 2007 we began limited development activities in 2006 which used net cash of approximately 146 million in 2007 227 million in 2008 and 68 million in 2009 we have also been renovating select properties using net cash of approximately 76 million in 2009 182 million in 2008 and 113 million in 2007 in 2007 and 

 

 

2009 we received a total of 392 million and 299 million respectively from the disposition of real estate assets mainly related to property sales no communities were sold in 2008 

net cash provided by financing activities was 181 million 973 million and 19 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the fluctuation in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units proceeds from issuances of common shares and units was primarily impacted by sales of common stock through our controlled equity offering program midamerica received a total of 328 million 1036 million and 188 million in net proceeds during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in relation to sales through this program net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series f for 119 million 

during 2009 midamerica sold 763000 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating net proceeds of approximately 328 million in 2008 and 2007 midamerica sold 1955300 shares and 323700 shares generating net proceeds of approximately 1036 million and 188 million respectively 

during 2009 midamerica did not offer a discount through our drspp and issued approximately 1100 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 39000 in proceeds however during 2008 and 2007 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 403000 shares and 120000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 20 million and 6 million in proceeds respectively 

on october 16 2007 midamerica redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series f for the total redemption price of 119 million 

the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2009 for the 14 billion of debt outstanding was 40 compared to the weighted average interest rate of 48 on 13 billion of debt outstanding at december 31 2008 we utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as companywide secured credit facilities we utilize fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section 

at december 31 2009 we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association or fnma financial federal which are credit enhanced by the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a 50 million bank facility with a syndicate of banks together these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of 14 billion with all but 60 million collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2009 we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 13 billion at december 31 2009 

approximately 72 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2009 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma also referred to as the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 104 billion all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2009 we had total borrowings outstanding under the fnma facilities of approximately 100 billion at december 31 2009 various traunches of the fnma facilities mature from 2011 through 2018 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs rate which are creditenhanced by fnma and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating threemonth libor less a spread that has averaged 016 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 049 to 067 we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and threemonth libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent while we feel this recent volatility is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change 

approximately 21 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2009 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by freddie mac also referred to as the freddie mac facilities the freddie mac facilities have a combined line limit of 300 million of which 298 million was collateralized and 

 

 

available to borrow at december 31 2009 we had total borrowings outstanding under the freddie mac facilities of approximately 298 million at december 31 2009 the freddie mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014 the interest rate on the freddie mac facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the freddie mac reference bill rate on the date of renewal which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90day libor plus a credit enhancement fee of 065 to 069 the freddie mac reference bill rate has traded consistently below libor and the historical average spread has risen to 040 below libor 

each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and is subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect our liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect 

the following schedule details the line limits collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of december 31 2009 in thousands 



as of december 31 2009 we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 883 million to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges we had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 172 million as of december 31 2009

the following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2009 in thousands 



the following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements and fixed rate debt as of december 31 2009 in thousands 



we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations annual refurbishment of our properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and on fnma and freddie mac or the agencies who have now been placed into conservatorship by the us government and whose securities are now implicitly governmentguaranteed the agencies provide credit enhancement for approximately 13 billion of our debt as of december 31 2009 the federal housing finance agency or fhfa which was appointed conservator of the agencies recognizes the importance of multifamily housing finance for healthy secondary market and housing affordability and expects fnma and freddie mac to continue underwriting and financing sound multifamily business 

the interest rate markets for fnma dmbs and freddie mac reference bills which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us financial federal a freddie mac program plus lender and servicer is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between financial federal and us 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 102 million as compared to 127 million and 41 million for the same periods in 2008 and 2007 respectively while we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant deterioration in 

 

 

operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate 

the following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our longterm debt and operating leases as of december 31 2009 dollars in thousands 



   offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2009 and 2008 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes our two joint ventures with crow holdings one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007 were established to acquire approximately 200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income midamerica multifamily fund i llc was established to acquire 500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2009 midamerica multifamily fund i llc owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities midamerica multifamily fund ii llc was established to acquire 250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2009 midamerica multifamily fund ii llc or fund ii owned one property in january 2010 midamerica contributed a property we had acquired in december 2009 to fund ii in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements note 13 

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2009 we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation 

inflation substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable midamerica to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to midamerica of the adverse effects of inflation

overview of midamerica 

  founded in 1994 midamerica apartment communities inc is a memphis tennesseebased selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit that focuses on acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states we together with our subsidiaries report as a single business segment as of december 31 2008 we owned 100 of 143 properties representing 41928 apartment units 20 of which were under construction and had a 3333 ownership interest in midamerica multifamily fund i llc or fund i which owned 2 properties containing 626 apartment units our apartment communities were located in 13 states

  our corporate offices are located at 6584 poplar avenue memphis tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is 901 6826600 as of december 31 2008 we had 1173 full time employees and 72 part time employees 

  unless the context otherwise requires all references in this annual report on form 10k to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “midamerica” refer collectively to midamerica apartment communities inc and its subsidiaries 

operating philosophy 

  midamerica’s primary objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner midamerica focuses on growing shareholder value by effectively and efficiently operating our existing investments and when accretive to shareholder value through new investments 

  investment focus  midamerica’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states we believe that sustaining a relatively young portfolio with continued growth potential is important and believe that we have one of the younger portfolios in the apartment sector we are focused on the acquisition of new properties with exceptional growth potential and properties that we believe can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and our operating management skills we are currently focusing on increasing our investments in relatively new properties within our current geographic area with the potential for above average growth we have an existing joint venture whose goal is to acquire and reposition properties 7 – 15 years old that has now completed its investment program we are working to establish a new joint venture to continue this investment strategy 

  beginning in 2005 midamerica began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities as well as a limited program of developing new apartments principally as expansions of existing communities we will continue our established process of selling mature assets and will adapt our investment focus to opportunities and markets in order to improve our return on investment we have from timetotime invested with joint venture partners and anticipate this will be a growing part of our strategy 

  high quality assets  midamerica has one of the younger reit portfolios and strives to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment midamerica periodically and selectively sells assets to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within our market area 

  diversified market focus  we believe the stability of our cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow returns with lower volatility through our diversified strategy of investments over both primary and secondary markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states 

  intensive property and asset management focus  midamerica has traditionally emphasized property management and over the past several years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and most recently revenue management a large majority of midamerica’s property managers are certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals midamerica also provides our own inhouse leadership development program consisting of an 18month threemodule program followed by two comprehensive case studies which was developed with the assistance of us learning inc 

  decentralized operational structure  midamerica operates in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations in 2004 midamerica completed the installation of the property and accounting modules of a new webbased property management system that increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis improving the support provided to onsite property operations in 2005 we made significant improvements to our operating platform and we expect these enhancements will help capture more operating efficiencies continue to support effective expense control and provide for various expanded revenue management practices in 2007 we implemented a new “yield management” pricing program that we expect will help our property managers to optimize rental revenues we also installed new purchase order and accounts payable software in 2007 and implemented processes to provide improved controls and management information in 2008 we implemented revised utility billing processes rolled out new websites enabling online lease applications and improved webbased marketing programs and we anticipate continued enhancements in 2009 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

  midamerica focuses on improving the net present value of each share of midamerica common stock we routinely evaluate each asset and from timetotime sell those that no longer fit our strategy we make new investments and issue new equity when management believes it can add to value per share in the past midamerica has sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

strategies 

  midamerica seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

  operating growth strategy  midamericas goal is to maximize our return on investment in each apartment community by increasing revenues tightly controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations 

utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market conditions and individual unit amenities 

developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents including telephone cable and internet access on which we generate fee and commission income 

implementing programs to control expenses through investment in costsaving initiatives including measuring and passing on to residents the cost of various expenses including water and other utility costs 

analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas 

proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property 

improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning apartment communities from timetotime to maintain market leadership positions 

compensating employees through performancebased compensation and stock ownership programs 

maintaining a handson management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior managements continued close contact with the market and employees 

selling or exchanging underperforming assets 

repurchasing or issuing shares of common or preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit 

aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing 

allocating additional capital including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements where the investment will generate the highest returns for midamerica and 

acquiring and from time to time developing properties when expected returns exceed our investment hurdle rate 

  joint venture strategy  one of midamerica’s strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities from timetotime to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for midamerica at present we have focused the investment on properties 7 years old or older with younger acquisitions becoming part of the whollyowned portfolio 

  disposition strategy  midamerica from timetotime disposes of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically midamerica selects assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs midamerica may from timetotime also dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above no apartment communities were sold during 2008 

  acquisition strategy  one of midamerica’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and focus as discussed above when the expected returns exceed our investment hurdle rate generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20 midamerica has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition midamerica will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis we will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states 

  the following apartment communities were purchased during 2008 

    7 

  development strategy  in 2006 midamerica began some limited expansion development projects on adjacent land to existing apartment communities using fixed price contracts we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way we prefer to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new properties 

common and preferred stock 

  midamerica continuously reviews opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share we evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value and accordingly repurchased common stock funded by asset sales between 1999 and 2001 midamerica also looks for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital we will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as we did in 2003 2006 and 2007 

  on november 3 2006 midamerica entered into a sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co to sell up to 2000000 shares of midamerica’s common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity offering program in july 2008 we entered into a second controlled equity offering sales agreement with similar terms authorizing the sale of up to 1350000 shares of common stock 

  the following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these agreements through december 31 2008 



  in october 2007 midamerica redeemed all of our issued and outstanding 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock for 119 million 

  midamerica also has a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 throughout 2008 we issued a total of 402593 shares through the direct stock purchase plan at an average 15 discount and terminated the discount in december 2008 no waivers were granted during 2008 

share repurchase program 

  in 1999 midamerica’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of midamerica’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2008 midamerica had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to sell assets based on our disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2008 under this plan 

competition 

  all of midamerica’s apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than midamerica and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than midamerica’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition midamerica makes capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

  as part of the acquisition process midamerica obtains environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before midamerica takes ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

  under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

  midamerica is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold midamerica has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease midamerica has also purchased a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2010 but is renewable at that time midamerica therefore believes that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

  the environmental studies received by midamerica have not revealed any material environmental liabilities midamerica is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which midamerica is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

  midamerica believes that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

  acquisitions on january 16 2009 midamerica acquired one of the 15 remaining units of the village oaks apartments located in temple terrace tampa florida 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

  we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our shareholders annually as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and our property in 2008 we declared total distributions of 246 per common share to our shareholders 




 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders 

  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and preferred dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

competition from other apartment communities 

overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in our markets which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates andor require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units 

conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use 

job losses resulting from further declines in economic activity 

increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset by increased rents 

inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms 

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance 

changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing 

withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of federal national mortgage association or fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac 

an uninsured loss resulting from a catastrophic storm or act of terrorism 

changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing borrower credit standards and downpayment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available or increase our acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available 

weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing and 

the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 

  at times we rely on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions 

  recently domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty liquidity has tightened in financial markets including the investment grade debt the cmbs commercial paper and equity capital markets a large majority of apartment financing and as of december 31 2008 89 of our outstanding debt is provided by or creditenhanced by fnma and freddie mac which are now under the conservatorship of the us government we have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships between libor which is the basis for the payments to us by our swap counterparties and the actual interest rate we pay through the fannie mae discount mortgage backed security or dmbs and the freddie mac reference bill programs which we believe to be temporary this creates a risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past and it makes forecasting more difficult were our credit arrangements with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma or with financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac to fail or their ability to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired we would have to seek alternative sources of capital which might not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition any such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise this could also cause our swaps to become ineffective triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements if any of the foregoing events were to occur it could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and prospects 

  our credit facilities with fnma and freddie mac expire 2011 – 2018 and we anticipate that replacement facilities will be at a higher cost and have less attractive terms 

a change in us government policy with regard to fnma and freddie mac could seriously impact our financial condition 

  the u s government has committed 200 billion of preferred equity each to fnma and freddie mac and placed them in conservatorship through the end of 2009 the treasury department has recently increased fnma and freddie mac’s portfolio limitation to 900 billion which at present is required to be reduced on a phased basis beginning in 2010 through expansion of their offbalance sheet lending products which form the large majority of our borrowing we believe that fnma and freddie mac balance sheet limitations will not restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry and to us in particular statements supporting their involvement in apartment lending by the heads of multifamily lending of fnma freddie mac and their regulator have recently been reiterated should this support change it would have a material adverse affect on both us and the multifamily industry and we would seek alternative sources of funding this could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps potentially causing a breach in one or more of our loan covenants and through reduced loan availability impact the value of multifamily assets which could impair the value of our properties 

a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall and be in default of our loan covenants 

  midamerica borrows on a secured basis from fnma freddie mac and regions bank a significant reduction in value could require us to post additional collateral while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity future asset values are uncertain if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility this would have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

  at december 31 2008 we had total debt outstanding of 13 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we currently intend to limit our total debt to approximately 60 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2008 our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 50 our board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow us to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition we must repay our debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect our financial condition andor our funds from operations we rely on fnma and freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and have agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject to revaluation quarterly the breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on our operations 

interest rate hedging may be ineffective 

  we rely on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also are heavily reliant on the agencies which provide credit or credit enhancement for approximately 12 billion of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2008 the debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital creditenhanced by fnma and financial federal creditenhanced by freddie mac we pay fees to the credit facility providers and the agencies plus interest which is tied to the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate the agencies have been placed into conservatorship by the us government under the supervision of the federal housing finance agency which has committed 200 billion of capital to each if needed 

  the interest rate market for the fnma dmbs rate and the freddie mac reference bill rate both of which have been highly correlated with libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness in our experience the fnma dmbs rate has averaged 5 basis points to 12 basis points below libor and the freddie mac reference bill rate has averaged 15 basis points to 17 basis points below libor but in the past year the spreads have increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically seen we believe that the current market illiquidity is an anomaly and that the spreads and the volatility will return to more stable historic trends but we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility over a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

  the difference in interest rates between the dmbs and reference bill rates and threemonth libor which is a component of the ineffectiveness of the liborbased swaps flows through interest expense in the current period and together with the recognized ineffectiveness which is also an adjustment to current period interest expense reduces the effectiveness of the swaps 

  we also rely on the credit of the counterparties that provide swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities we use three major banks to provide nearly 78 of our swaps jp morgan chase royal bank of canada and deutsche bank all of which have high investment grade ratings from moody’s and sp in the event that one of our swap providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail our swaps may become ineffective in which case the value of the swap would be adjusted to value in the current period possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient to cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

one or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default causing us significant financial exposure 

  we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated generally aa or above by standard  poors or aa3 or above by moody’s we also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties in the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade this could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or lose the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay the swap counter party the net present value of the swap which may represent a significant current period cash charge possibly sufficient to cause us to breach one or more loan covenants 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

  at december 31 2008 effectively 185 million of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps we may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to shareholders our 10 billion secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma are predominately floating rate facilities we also have credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 300 million which are variable rate facilities at december 31 2008 a total of 12 billion was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates we were exposed to at december 31 2008 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps we will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

  as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise our financial condition could be negatively impacted and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses and may cause a breach of a loan covenants 

  we have a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid earthquake zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these risks we may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our assets financial condition and results of operation 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we are dependent on key personnel 

  our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

  we intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties we must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

we may not be able to sell communities when appropriate 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions further we own seven communities of 145 total which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b taxfree exchange unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate   

  some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock 

  our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

will consider the transfer to be null and void   will not reflect the transaction on our books   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares   will consider the shares held in trust for our benefit and   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to us or we will redeem the shares if we redeem the shares you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of  you may lose your power to dispose of the shares   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases and   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

ownership limit the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests currently we have 6200000 shares of 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock issued and outstanding 

tennessee antitakeover statutes as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

  investments in joint ventures may involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

the potential inability of our joint venture partner to perform   the joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to ours   the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies and   the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating to the property they jointly own   although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation 

  if we failed to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we would be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

failure to make required distributions would subject us to income taxation 

  in order to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition we will incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

85 of ordinary income for that year   95 of capital gain net income for that year and   100 of undistributed taxable income from prior years   differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities 

  to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

  midamerica’s common stock has been listed and traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse under the symbol “maa” since our initial public offering in february 1994 on february 6 2009 the reported last sale price of midamerica’s common stock on the nyse was 2931 per share and there were approximately 1728 holders of record of the common stock midamerica believes we have a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common stock the following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices of our common stock and the dividends declared by midamerica with respect to the periods indicated 



  midamerica’s quarterly dividend rate is currently 0615 per common share the board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by midamerica will be affected by a number of factors including the gross revenues received from the apartment communities the operating expenses of midamerica the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures 

  midamerica expects to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by midamerica will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the actual funds from operations of midamerica our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 

  midamerica has established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in midamerica apartments lp can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges midamerica in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp midamerica may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market midamerica may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount 

  in 2006 midamerica issued a total of 1356015 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases in 2007 midamerica issued a total of 136483 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases in 2008 midamerica issued a total of 421794 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  revenue recognition 

  we lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

  we record all gains and losses on sales of real estate in accordance with statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate  

  capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

  we carry real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 1 year for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred 

  development costs which in 2008 were limited to adding new units to three existing properties are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and statement of financial accounting standards no 34 capitalization of interest cost  

  impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  we account for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  or statement 144 and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets or statement 142 we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified we periodically evaluate longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

  in accordance with statement 144 longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

  in accordance with statement 142 goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare the fair value to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate we determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations  the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

  fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  midamerica utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 

  in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while midamerica’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by midamerica before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

  midamerica measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

  on january 1 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements or statement 157 statement 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements statement 157 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements accordingly the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 

  statement 157 emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement therefore a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements statement 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy 

  level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that midamerica has the ability to access level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety midamerica’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 

  the valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities to comply with the provisions of statement 157 midamerica incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees 

  although midamerica has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties as of december 31 2008 midamerica has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives as a result midamerica has determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of december 31 2008 midamerica had a total of 9905 million of notional amount in derivative instruments all of which had fair values measured using level 3 inputs realized and unrealized losses did not materially affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources during the year midamerica experienced an overall decrease in fair value of our derivatives due to the fluctuations in the interest rate market throughout the year 

overview of the year ended december 31 2008 

  midamerica experienced an increase in income from continuing operations before nonoperating items in 2008 as we continued to grow our portfolio through acquisitions and limited development and our same store portfolio maintained an average occupancy of 953 and raised average effective rents by 18 over 2007 our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions communities being developed or in leaseup communities undergoing extensive renovations and communities identified as discontinued operations 

  midamerica has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states midamerica acquired six properties in 2006 four properties in 2007 and five properties in 2008 midamerica also purchased two properties through a joint venture in 2008 offsetting some of this increased revenue stream is five property dispositions in 2007 one of which was through a joint venture 

  midamerica also benefited from reduced interest expense in 2008 as our twelve month average interest rate dropped from 54 in 2007 to 49 in 2008 

  the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of midamerica for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  as of december 31 2008 the total number of apartment units midamerica owned or had an ownership interest in was 42554 in 145 communities compared to 40248 apartment units in 137 communities at december 31 2007 and 40293 apartment units in 138 communities at december 31 2006 for communities owned 100 by midamerica the average monthly rental per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to 750 at december 31 2008 from 743 at december 31 2007 and 726 at december 31 2006 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was 934 947 and 942 respectively 

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2007 

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by approximately 223 million from the year ended december 31 2008 due to i a 71 million increase in property revenues from the five properties acquired in 2008 or the 2008 acquisitions ii a 58 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007 or the 2007 acquisitions iii a 17 million increase in property revenues from our development communities and iv a 77 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by a 18 increase in average effective rent per unit in 2008 over 2007 

  property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by approximately 129 million from the year ended december 31 2007 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 35 million from the 2008 acquisitions ii 29 million from the 2007 acquisitions iii 08 million from our development communities and iv 57 million from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of midamerica’s same store portfolio and represented an average 35 increase over prior year expenses and included 591000 of expense related to hurricane ike 

  depreciation expense increased by approximately 54 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 23 million from the 2008 acquisitions ii 16 million from the 2007 acquisitions iii 03 million from our development communities and iv 30 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 18 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of communities which we previously acquired 

  property management expenses decreased by approximately 11 million from the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2008 due to decreased incentive compensation general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 10 million over this same period mainly as a result of increased personnel costs 

  interest expense decreased approximately 16 million in 2008 from 2007 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 54 in 2007 to 49 in 2008 this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately 838 million from 2007 to 2008 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 54 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture the sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 10 million in 2007 in 2007 midamerica also benefited from a 92 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by midamerica midamerica had no property dispositions in 2008 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling 11 million for the year ended december 31 2008 midamerica recorded a loss of 03 million for these same items 

  primarily as a result of the foregoing net income decreased by approximately 97 million in 2008 from 2007 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2006 

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by approximately 292 million from the year ended december 31 2006 due to i a 48 million increase in property revenues from the 2007 acquisitions ii an 115 million increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006 or the 2006 acquisitions iii a 08 million increase in property revenues from the development communities and iv a 121 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an average 25 increase in average rent per unit in 2007 over 2006 

  property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by approximately 98 million from the year ended december 31 2006 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 21 million from the 2007 acquisitions ii 50 million from the 2006 acquisitions iii 03 million form the development communities and iv 24 million from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of midamerica’s same store portfolio and represented an average 27 increase over prior year expenses 

  depreciation expense increased by approximately 72 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 12 million from the 2007 acquisitions ii 33 million from the 2006 acquisitions iii 02 million from the development communities iv 18 million from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods and v 07 million from the amortization of fair market value of leases of acquired communities 

  property management expenses increased by approximately 48 million from the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2007 partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 09 million over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance 

  interest expense increased approximately 13 million in 2007 from 2006 due primarily to the approximate 424 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2006 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 54 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture the sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 10 million in 2007 in 2007 midamerica also benefited from a 92 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by midamerica midamerica had no property dispositions in 2006 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling 11 million for the year ended december 31 2006 midamerica recorded 01 million for these same items 

  primarily as a result of the foregoing net income increased by approximately 190 million in 2007 over 2006 

funds from operations 

  funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gains on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

  in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock mid america has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

  midamericas policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity midamerica believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding midamericas operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets midamerica believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies midamerica’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 dollars and shares in thousands 

   ffo increases for both 2008 over 2007 and 2007 over 2006 were principally the result of improved community operations from midamerica’s same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2006 acquisitions 2007 acquisitions and 2008 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above 

 

trends 

  during the first half of 2008 rental demand for apartments continued at robust levels in most of our markets with the notable exception of florida where after several years of good growth markets weakened towards the end of the second quarter we experienced a reduction in our rate of revenue growth which we think is likely to be due to the slowdown in general economic conditions during the third quarter and through the end of 2008 the rate of revenue growth continued to slow 

  job formation which is a primary driver of demand by apartment residents weakened towards the end of the second quarter and through the end of 2008 on the supply side new apartment construction continued to be limited as in most markets rents have yet to rise sufficiently to offset the rapid runup of costs of new construction over the last five years and financing for new development has become difficult to obtain competition from condominiums reverting back to being rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in most of our markets because most of our markets and submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we are seeing significant rental competition from condominiums and single family houses in only a few submarkets 

  the primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house but we have seen that reason as a percent of total moveouts drop over the past twelve months analysts point out that homeownership increased from 65 to over 69 of households over ten years ending in 2005 this increase representing approximately five million households was driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products many requiring no downpayment and minimal credit ratings with a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards it is possible that a longterm correction will occur and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels this could be quite significant for the apartment business and we believe if this occurs it could benefit us for several years 

  we believe that the signs of slower revenue growth will be temporary and that revenue growth should resume in 2010 we also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment supply and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties at the same time we expect long term demographic trends including the growth of prime age groups for rentals immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets 

  while it seems possible that in 2009 we will face declining economic growth as a result of reduced liquidity in the economy we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive and that positive absorption of apartments will return for most of our markets in 2010 should the economy fall into a deeper recession the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact 

liquidity and capital resources 

  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 194 million to 1379 million for 2008 compared to 1186 million for 2007 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2008 net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 161 million to 1186 million for 2007 compared to 1025 million for 2006 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2007   

  net cash used in investing activities was approximately 2430 million 1088 million and 2411 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity a total of approximately 1563 million was invested in 2008 to acquire properties this compares to approximately 886 million in 2007 and 1950 million in 2006 midamerica began limited development activities in 2006 which used net cash of approximately 109 million in 2006 146 million in 2007 and 227 million in 2008 midamerica also expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately 61 million in 2006 113 million in 2007 and 182 million in 2008 in 2007 midamerica received a total of 392 million from the disposition of real estate assets mainly related to property sales no communities were sold in 2006 or 2008 

  net cash provided by financing activities was 973 million 19 million and 1301 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the fluctuation in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately 1520 million primarily due to midamerica’s raising of funds through stock issuances from our direct stock purchase plan a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering during 2007 midamerica was not as active in raising funds through these equity plans however in 2008 midamerica raised a total of 1260 million of proceeds from issuances of common shares and units primarily through a controlled equity plan net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series f for 119 million 

  the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2008 for the 13 billion of debt outstanding was 48 compared to the weighted average interest rate of 54 on 13 billion of debt outstanding at december 31 2007 we utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as companywide secured credit facilities we utilize fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section 

  at december 31 2008 we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association or fnma financial federal which are credit enhanced by federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a 50 million bank facility together these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of 139 billion and collateralized availability to borrow of 136 billion at december 31 2008 we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 118 billion at december 31 2008 

  approximately 68 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2008 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma also referred to as the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 104 billion all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2008 we had total borrowings outstanding under the fnma facilities of approximately 905 million at december 31 2008 various traunches of the fnma facilities mature from 2011 through 2018 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs which are creditenhanced by fnma and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating threemonth libor less an average spread of 005  013 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 049 to 0795 while generally the dmbs continued to trade below threemonth libor the spread between them increased during the fourth quarter of 2007 and during 2008 ranging from 005 above threemonth libor to 123 below threemonth libor while we feel this recent volatility is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change   

  approximately 21 of our outstanding obligations at december 31 2008 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by freddie mac also referred to as the freddie mac facilities the freddie mac facilities have a combined line limit of 300 million of which 276 million was collateralized and available to borrow at december 31 2008 we had total borrowings outstanding under the freddie mac facilities of approximately 276 million at december 31 2008 the freddie mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014 the interest rate on the freddie mac facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the freddie mac reference bill rate on the date of renewal which has historically approximated libor plus a credit enhancement fee of 65 basis points to 69 basis points the freddie mac reference bill rate has traded consistently below libor and the historical average spread has risen recently from the more normal 15 basis points to 17 basis points below libor to 41 basis points below libor with a high of 200 basis points below libor on november 1 2008 

  each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and is subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect our liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect 

  the following schedule details the line limits collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of december 31 2008 in thousands 

   as of december 31 2008 we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of 908 million to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges we had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 82 million as of december 31 2008

      during 2008 midamerica sold 1955300 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating net proceeds of approximately 1036 million in 2007 and 2006 midamerica sold 323700 shares and 194000 shares generating net proceeds of approximately 188 million and 115 million respectively 

  during 2008 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 403000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 20 million in proceeds during 2007 and 2006 midamerica also offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 120000 and 1340000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 6 million and 77 million in proceeds respectively 

  on october 16 2007 midamerica redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series f for the total redemption price of 119 million 

  in may 2006 midamerica sold 1150000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately 595 million 

  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations annual refurbishment of our properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and on fnma and freddie mac or the agencies who have now been placed into conservatorship by the us government and whose securities are now implicitly governmentguaranteed the agencies provide credit enhancement for approximately 12 billion of our debt as of december 31 2008 the federal housing finance agency or fhfa is the appointed conservator of the agencies and in a press release dated september 12 2008 stated that “business will continue as usual at the enterprises during the conservatorship – this applies to both their single family and multifamily businesses fhfa recognizes the importance of all aspects of the enterprises’ multifamily businesses … for a healthy secondary market and housing affordability in particular support for multifamily housing finance is central to the enterprises’ public purpose… as conservator fhfa expects each enterprise to continue underwriting and financing sound multifamily business” 

  the interest rate markets for fnma dmbs and freddie mac reference bills which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness prudential mortgage capital a dus lender for fannie mae markets 90day fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities monthly and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us financial federal a freddie mac program plus lender and servicer is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between financial federal and us 

  for the year ended december 31 2008 our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 127 million as compared to 41 million for the same period in 2007 this compares to a shortfall for the twelve months of 2005 of approximately 45 million while we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate 

  the following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our longterm debt and operating leases as of december 31 2008 dollars in thousands 

    offbalance sheet arrangements 

  at december 31 2008 and 2007 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes our two joint ventures with crow holdings one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007 were established to acquire approximately 200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income midamerica multifamily fund i llc was established to acquire 500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing as of december 31 2008 midamerica multifamily fund i llc owned two properties but did not expect to acquire any additional communities in addition we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements note 14 

  our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

  midamerica renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2008 we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced would not have a significant impact on our liquidity financial position or results of operation we expect the renegotiated programs to result in a reduction in annual policy premiums of approximately 13 million when compared to the higher rates experienced with the prior policy 

inflation 

  substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable midamerica to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to midamerica of the adverse effects of inflation

operating philosophy 

  midamerica’s primary objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing midamerica in a disciplined manner midamerica focuses on growing shareholder value by effectively and efficiently operating its existing investments and when accretive to shareholder value through new investments 

  investment focus  midamerica’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states between 1994 and 1997 midamerica grew largely through acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities between 1998 and 2002 its concentration was on development of new communities since 2003 we have focused on the acquisition of properties that we believe can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and our operating management skills we are currently focusing on increasing our investments in properties in larger and faster growing markets within our current geographic area and intend to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth beginning in 2005 midamerica began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities as well as a limited program of developing new apartments principally as expansions of existing communities we will continue our established process of selling mature assets and will adapt our investment focus to opportunities and markets in order to improve our return on investment we have from timetotime invested with joint venture partners and anticipate this will be a growing part of our strategy 

  high quality assets  midamerica strives to maintain its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment midamerica believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of our properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability and illustrates the high quality of our properties and operations midamerica periodically and selectively sells assets to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within its market area 

  diversified market focus  we believe the stability of our cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow returns with lower volatility through our diversified strategy of investments over high growth growth and income and stable markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states 

  intensive property and asset management focus  midamerica has traditionally emphasized property management and in the past three years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and most recently revenue management at december 31 2007 midamerica employed approximately 106 certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals 

  decentralized operational structure  midamerica operates in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations in 2004 midamerica completed the installation of the property and accounting modules of a new webbased property management system that increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis improving the support provided to onsite property operations 

in 2005 we made significant improvements to our operating platform and we expect these enhancements will help capture more operating efficiencies continue to support effective expense control and provide for various expanded revenue management practices in the second quarter of 2007 we implemented a new “yield management” pricing program that we expect will help our property managers to optimize rental revenues in the third quarter of 2007 we installed new purchase order and accounts payable software and implemented processes to provide improved controls and management information 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

  midamerica focuses on improving the net present value of each share of midamerica common stock we routinely evaluate each asset and from timetotime sell those that no longer fit our strategy midamerica makes new investments and issues new equity when management believes it can add to value per share in the past midamerica has sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

strategies 

  midamerica seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

  operating growth strategy  midamericas goal is to maximize our return on investment in each apartment community by increasing revenues tightly controlling operating expenses maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations   utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market conditions   developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents including telephone cable and internet access on which midamerica generates fee and commission income   implementing programs to control expenses through investment in costsaving initiatives such as the installation of individual apartment unit water and utility meters in certain apartment communities   analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas   proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property   improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning apartment communities from timetotime to maintain market leadership positions   compensating employees through performancebased compensation and stock ownership programs 5 

maintaining a handson management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior managements continued close contact with the market and employees   selling or exchanging underperforming assets   repurchasing or issuing shares of common or preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit   aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing and   allocating additional capital including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements where the investment will generate the highest returns for midamerica   joint venture strategy  one of midamerica’s strategies is to coinvest with partners in joint venture opportunities from timetotime to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for midamerica 

  disposition strategy  midamerica from timetotime disposes of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically midamerica selects assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs midamerica may from timetotime also dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above 

the following apartment communities were sold during 2007 

   acquisition strategy  one of midamerica’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and focus as discussed above midamerica has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition midamerica will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis midamerica will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states 

the following apartment communities were purchased during 2007 

   development strategy  in 2006 midamerica began some expansion development projects at existing apartment communities on adjacent land we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way we prefer to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new properties 

common and preferred stock 

  midamerica continuously reviews opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share midamerica evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value and accordingly repurchased common stock funded by asset sales between 1999 and 2001 midamerica also looks for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital midamerica will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as we did in 2003 2006 and 2007 

  on november 3 2006 midamerica entered into a sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co to sell up to 2000000 shares of midamerica’s common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity offering program from january through april of 2007 midamerica sold 323700 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 188 million after underwriting commissions and sec fees an average net price of 5800 per share 

  in october 2007 midamerica redeemed all of our issued and outstanding 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock for 119 million 

  midamerica also has a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 throughout 2007 we issued a total of 136483 shares through our direct stock purchase plan at an average 15 discount no waivers were granted during 2007 

share repurchase program 

  in 1999 midamerica’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of midamerica’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2007 midamerica had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to sell assets based on our disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2007 under this plan 

competition 

  all of midamerica’s apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than midamerica and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than midamerica’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition midamerica makes capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

  as part of the acquisition process midamerica obtains environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before midamerica takes ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

  under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

  midamerica is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold midamerica has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease midamerica has also purchased a 5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2010 but is renewable at that time midamerica therefore believes that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

  the environmental studies received by midamerica have not revealed any material environmental liabilities midamerica is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which midamerica is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

  midamerica believes that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders 

  midamerica’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and preferred dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of midamerica’s apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

competition from other apartment communities   overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in midamerica’s markets which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates andor require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use   increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset by increased rents   inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance   changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing   an uninsured loss resulting from a catastrophic storm or act of terrorism   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available or increase midamerica’s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing and   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments   at times midamerica relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while midamerica has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event midamerica would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in midamerica’s funds from operations could adversely affect midamerica’s ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on midamerica’s stock price 

midamerica’s financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions 

  recently domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty while this condition has occurred most visibly within the “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit market liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets including the investment grade debt and equity capital markets consequently there is greater risk that the financial institutions midamerica does business with could experience disruptions that would negatively affect our current financing program 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

  at december 31 2007 midamerica had total debt outstanding of 13 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave midamerica with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for midamerica to maintain our qualification as a reit midamerica currently intends to limit our total debt to approximately 60 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels circumstances may cause midamerica to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2007 midamerica’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 54 midamerica’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow midamerica to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition midamerica must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect midamerica’s financial condition andor our funds from operations midamerica relies on federal national mortgage association or fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and has agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants the breach of any one of these covenants would place midamerica in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on the operations of midamerica 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

  at december 31 2007 effectively 226 million of midamerica’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps midamerica may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect midamerica’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders midamerica’s 10 billion secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fnma are predominately floating rate facilities midamerica also has credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 300 million which are variable rate facilities at december 31 2007 a total of 11 billion was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates midamerica was exposed to at december 31 2007 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps midamerica will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

interest rate hedging may be ineffective 

  midamerica relies on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma which provides credit enhancement for approximately 906 million of midamerica’s debt the interest rate market for fnma discount mortgage backed securities or dmbs which in midamerica’s experience is highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates is also an important component of midamerica’s liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness 

typically for the credit facility we have with fnma the dmbs rate has approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 005  009 over the life of the facility we also pay a credit enhancement fee which in the case of fnma facility is 062 in september 2007 however the spread between threemonth libor and dmbs increased significantly and peaked at 057 in december before dropping back to 027 in february 2008 while we believe that the current market illiquidity is an anomaly and that this spread will return to more historic levels midamerica cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change continued unusual volatility could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps resulting in material changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment communities dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions midamerica cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans midamerica may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly midamerica could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

  as a result of midamerica’s substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of midamerica if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise midamerica’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and midamerica’s ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  midamerica carries comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intends to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured midamerica exercises our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if midamerica suffers a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses and may cause a breach of a loan covenant 

  midamerica has a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid earthquake zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that midamerica pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of midamerica’s insurance for these risks midamerica may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on midamerica’s assets financial condition and results of operation 

midamerica is dependent on key personnel 

  our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

  midamerica intends to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations midamerica may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully midamerica must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties midamerica must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

midamerica may not be able to sell communities when appropriate 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly midamerica may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor is midamerica aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 

some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements midamerica cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to midamerica or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require midamerica to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require midamerica to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on midamerica with respect to improved access by disabled persons midamerica cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock 

  our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

will consider the transfer to be null and void   will not reflect the transaction on our books   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares   will consider the shares held in trust for our benefit and   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to us or we will redeem the shares if we redeem the shares you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of  14 

if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

you may lose your power to dispose of the shares   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases and   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

  ownership limit 

  the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

  preferred stock 

  our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests currently we have 6200000 shares of 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock issued and outstanding 

  tennessee antitakeover statutes 

  as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

  investments in joint ventures may involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

the potential inability of our joint venture partner to perform   the joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to ours   the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies and   the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating to the property they jointly own 15 

although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause midamerica to be taxed as a corporation 

  if midamerica fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes midamerica will be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that midamerica fails to qualify as a reit midamerica would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions midamerica would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status midamerica might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

failure to make required distributions would subject midamerica to income taxation 

  in order to qualify as a reit each year midamerica must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that midamerica satisfies the distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of taxable income it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition midamerica will incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

85 of ordinary income for that year   95 of capital gain net income for that year and   100 of undistributed taxable income from prior years differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require midamerica to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

complying with reit requirements may cause midamerica to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities 

  to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes midamerica must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of midamerica’s stock in order to meet these tests midamerica may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder midamerica’s ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

  midamerica’s quarterly dividend rate is currently 0615 per common share the board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by midamerica will be affected by a number of factors including the gross revenues received from the apartment communities the operating expenses of midamerica the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures 

  midamerica expects to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by midamerica will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the actual funds from operations of midamerica our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 

  midamerica has established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in midamerica apartments lp can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges midamerica in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp midamerica may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market midamerica may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount 

  in 2005 midamerica issued a total of 803251 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases in 2006 midamerica issued a total of 1356015 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases in 2007 midamerica issued a total of 136483 shares through our drspp and offered an average discount of 15 for optional cash purchases

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

  this and other sections of this annual report on form 10k contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated market conditions expected growth rates of revenues and expenses planned asset dispositions disposition pricing planned acquisitions developments and renovations property financings expected interest rates joint venture activity and planned capital expenditures although midamerica believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by midamerica or any other person that the objectives and plans of midamerica will be achieved 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon midamerica’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires midamerica to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis midamerica evaluates our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances midamerica believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  midamerica believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  revenue recognition 

  midamerica leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

  we record all gains and losses on sales of real estate in accordance with statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate  

  capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

  midamerica carries real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment 3 to 5 years for computers and software and 1 year for acquired leases all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by midamerica in order to elevate the condition of the property to midamerica’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

  impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  midamerica accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  or statement 144 and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets or statement 142 midamerica evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in midamerica’s fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified midamerica periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

  in accordance with statement 144 longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

  goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first midamerica determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate midamerica determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement no 141 business combinations  the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

  fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  midamerica utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with midamerica’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended requires midamerica to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

  in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while midamerica’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by midamerica before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

  midamerica measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

overview of the year ended december 31 2007 

  midamerica’s results for 2007 were positively influenced by both improved operating performance from communities held throughout both the current and prior period or same store and the positive impact from acquisitions in recent years implementation of new operating platform systems is helping us to optimize the balance between increased occupancy and rental rates 

  midamerica has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states midamerica acquired three properties in 2005 and six properties in 2006 for which we benefited from full years of revenues in 2007 midamerica also acquired an additional four communities during 2007 offsetting some of this increased revenue stream is one property disposition in 2005 and dispositions of four properties during 2007 

  the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of midamerica for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  as of december 31 2007 the total number of apartment units midamerica owned or had an ownership interest in was 40248 in 137 communities compared to 40293 apartment units in 138 communities at december 31 2006 and 38227 apartment units in 132 communities at december 31 2005 for communities owned 100 by midamerica the average monthly rental per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to 743 at december 31 2007 from 726 at december 31 2006 and 695 at december 31 2005 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 947 942 and 946 respectively 

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2006 

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by approximately 295 million from the year ended december 31 2006 due to i an 115 million increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006 or the 2006 acquisitions ii a 48 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007 or the 2007 acquisitions iii a 08 million increase in property revenues from our development communities and iv a 124 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an average 25 increase in average rent per unit in 2007 over 2006 

  property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by approximately 99 million from the year ended december 31 2006 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 50 million from the 2006 acquisitions ii 21 million from the 2007 acquisitions iii 03 million from our development communities and iv 25 million from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of midamerica’s same store portfolio and represented an average 29 increase over prior year expenses

  property management expenses increased by approximately 48 million from the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2007 partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes and implementation expenses associated with improved operating systems general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 09 million over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance 

  interest expense increased approximately 13 million in 2007 from 2006 due primarily to the approximate 424 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2006 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs the impact from the increase in the average debt outstanding was partially offset by a decrease in the average annual borrowing costs from 55 for 2006 to 54 in 2007 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 54 million from the sale of a community owned by a joint venture of midamerica the sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 10 million in 2007 in 2007 midamerica also benefited from a 92 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by midamerica midamerica had no dispositions in 2006 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling 11 million for the year ended december 31 2006 midamerica recorded gains of 01 million for these same items

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by approximately 300 million from the year ended december 31 2005 due to i a 95 million increase in property revenues from the 2006 acquisitions ii a 53 million increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005 or the 2005 acquisitions and iii a 152 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an average 31 increase in average rent per unit in 2006 over 2005 

  property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by approximately 112 million from the year ended december 31 2005 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 46 million from the 2006 acquisitions ii 21 million from the 2005 acquisitions and iii 45 million from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an increase in property insurance reflecting the increase in premiums effective july 1 2006 the same store property operating expense increase also reflects increased utility rates as midamerica experienced an increase in electricity natural gas and water and sewer prices 

  depreciation expense increased by approximately 49 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 27 million from the 2006 acquisitions ii 12 million from the 2005 acquisitions and iii 20 million from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 10 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of acquired communities

  interest expense increased approximately 50 million in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to the approximate 497 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2005 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the average annual borrowing costs from 52 in 2005 to 55 in 2006 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 30 million from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of midamerica the sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 17 million in 2005 midamerica had no dispositions in 2006

  funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gains on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

  in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock midamerica has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

  midamericas policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity midamerica believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding midamericas operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets midamerica believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies midamerica’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 dollars and shares in thousands 

   ffo increases for both 2007 over 2006 and 2006 over 2005 were principally the result of improved community operations from midamerica’s same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2005 acquisitions 2006 acquisitions and 2007 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above 

trends 

  in 2007 rental demand for apartments continued to improve throughout most of midamerica’s markets both our high growth and our growth and income markets reported samestore revenue growth for the year averaging over 5 and noi growth averaging 69 exceptional performers were markets in texas and tennessee following several years of rapid growth markets in florida did not perform as well 

  the following chart shows performance by some of the larger markets in each of midamerica’s samestore portfolio groups averaged for the year 

 1 revenues and noi by market and market group are presented before the impact of straightline adjustments the total same store results include the revenue adjustments 

  job formation which is the primary driver of demand by apartment residents continued to be strong in most of our markets on the supply side new apartment construction continued to be limited as in most markets rents have yet to rise sufficiently to offset the rapid runup of costs of new construction over the last five years competition from condominiums reverting back to being rental units or new condominiums being converted to rental was not a major factor in most of our markets because most of our markets and submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes we have avoided committing a lot of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred we are seeing rental competition from condominiums and single family houses in only a few submarkets 

  the primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house but we have seen the number drop over the past six months from approximately 28 of moveouts to approximately 26 analysts point out that homeownership increased from 65 to almost 69 of households over the past ten years driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products many requiring no downpayment and minimal credit reporting with a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards it is possible that a longterm correction will occur and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels this could be quite significant for the apartment business and we believe if this occurs it could benefit us for several years 

  while it seems possible that we will face slower economic growth as a result of reduced liquidity in the economy we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive and that positive absorption of apartments will occur for most of our markets for the next two or three years should the economy fall into recession the limited new supply of apartments and the more controlled competition from single family housing should ameliorate the impact 

liquidity and capital resources 

  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 170 million to 1179 million for 2007 compared to 1009 million for 2006 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2007 net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 21 million to 1009 million for 2006 compared to 988 million for 2005 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2006 

  net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately 1315 million from 2396 million in 2006 to 1081 million in 2007 net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 1332 million from 1064 million in 2005 to 2396 million in 2006 the change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity a total of approximately 886 million was invested in 2007 to acquire properties this compares to approximately 1950 million in 2006 and 1056 million in 2005 midamerica began limited development activities in 2006 which used net cash of approximately 109 million in 2006 and 146 million in 2007 midamerica also expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately 04 million in 2005 61 million in 2006 and 113 million in 2007 finally midamerica’s net cash used in investing activities was influenced by different levels of dispositions across the three years in 2007 midamerica received 293 million from real estate dispositions compared to 21 million in 2006 and 97 million in 2005 

  net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately 1283 million to 19 million in 2007 from 1301 million in 2006 net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately 1176 million to 1301 million in 2006 from 125 million in 2005 net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately 1519 million primarily due to midamerica’s raising of funds through stock issuances from our direct stock purchase plan a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering during 2005 and 2007 midamerica was not as active in raising funds through these equity plans net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series f for 119 million 

  the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2007 for the 13 billion of debt outstanding was 54 compared to 56 on 12 billion of debt outstanding at december 31 2006 midamerica utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities midamerica utilizes fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on midamerica’s borrowings are disclosed in the schedule found later in this section 

  at december 31 2007 midamerica had secured credit facilities relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association or fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a group of banks led by regions financial corporation together these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of 14 billion at december 31 2007 with an availability to borrow of 12 billion at december 31 2007 midamerica had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 11 billion 

  approximately 72 of midamerica’s outstanding obligations at december 31 2007 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma which we call the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 10 billion most of which was available to borrow at december 31 2007 various traunches of the facilities mature from 2008 through 2014 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs rate on the date of renewal which has typically approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 005  009 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 062 to 0795 recently however the spread between threemonth libor and dmbs has increased up to 057 while we feel the current liquidity market is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels midamerica cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change 

  each of midamerica’s secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and are subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if midamerica were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect midamerica’s liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if midamerica were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect on midamerica 

  on may 26 2005 midamerica gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8 58 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock or series g on may 26 2006 for the total redemption price of 10 million as a result in accordance with statement no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  midamerica classified the series g as a liability within notes payable as of may 26 2005 on the accompanying consolidated financial statements on may 26 2006 midamerica redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series g 

  on october 16 2007 midamerica redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series f for the total redemption price of 119 million 

  as of december 31 2007 midamerica had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately 756 million to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges midamerica had also entered into two forward swaps as of december 31 2007 with a total combined notional amount of 50 million midamerica had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 47 million in effect as of december 31 2007 

  summary details of the debt outstanding at december 31 2007 follows in the table below dollars in thousands 

   during 2007 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 120000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 6 million in proceeds during 2006 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 1340000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 77 million in proceeds during 2005 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 784000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 32 million in proceeds 

  in may 2006 midamerica sold 1150000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately 595 million 

  during the first two quarters of 2007 midamerica sold 323700 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating approximately 188 million in net proceeds in december 2006 midamerica sold 194000 shares of common stock through this same program generating approximately 114 million in net proceeds 

  midamerica believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations and annual refurbishment of our communities through our cash flow and credit facilities midamerica is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma which provides credit enhancement for approximately 906 million of midamerica’s debt the interest rate market for fnma dmbs which in midamerica’s experience is highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates is also an important component of midamerica’s liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient or the credit of fnma becomes impaired midamerica would seek alternative sources of debt financing 

  for the year ended december 31 2007 midamerica’s net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering improvements to existing real estate assets excluding renovations distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 41 million this compares to a shortfall in 2006 of approximately 45 million and excess coverage in 2005 of approximately 31 million while midamerica has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates from timetotime midamerica may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in midamerica’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event midamerica would be required to reduce the distribution rate 

  the following table reflects midamerica’s total contractual cash obligations which consist of our longterm debt and operating leases as of december 31 2007 dollars in 000’s 

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

  at december 31 2007 and 2006 midamerica did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes midamerica’s two joint ventures with crow holdings one terminated in 2005 and one in 2007 were established to acquire approximately 200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance midamerica’s return on investment through the generation of fee income midamerica multifamily fund i llc was established to acquire 500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements operating enhancements and restructuring inplace financing in addition midamerica does not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such midamerica is not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

midamerica does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with midamerica or our related parties other than what is disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements note 14 

  midamerica’s investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as midamerica does not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

  midamerica renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1 2007 management believes that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced would not have a significant impact on midamerica’s liquidity financial position or results of operation management expects to obtain a reduction in annual policy premiums of approximately 15 million from the renegotiated programs when compared to the higher rates experienced after the july 1 2006 renewal 

inflation 

  substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable midamerica to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to midamerica of the adverse effects of inflation 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” or fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  midamerica adopted fin 48 effective january 1 2007 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns midamerica has identified and examined our tax positions including our status as a real estate investment trust for all open tax years through december 31 2006 and concluded that the full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial statements there are no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits that are reasonably likely to occur within the twelve months following the adoption date 

  fin 48 requires that an enterprise must calculate interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits the decision regarding where to classify interest and penalties on the income statement is an accounting policy decision that should be consistently applied interest and penalties calculated on any future uncertain tax positions will be presented as a component of income tax expense no interest and penalties are accrued under fin 48 on our balance sheet as of december 31 2007 

  midamerica’s tax years that remain subject to examination for us federal purposes range from 2003 through 2006 our tax years that remain open for state examination vary but range from 2002 through 2006 

  in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements  or statement 157 statement 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years fasb staff position no fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement 157  or fsp 1572 delays the effective date of statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis for these items the effective date will be for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 midamerica does not believe the adoption of statement 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 

  on december 4 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 revised 2007 business combinations  or statement 141r statement 141r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations under statement 141r an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value with limited exceptions statement 141r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items including acquisition costs which will generally be expensed as incurred this will have a material impact on the way midamerica accounts for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on midamerica’s financial statements statement 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 

  on december 4 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51  or statement 160 statement 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary specifically this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest this will impact the financial statement presentation of midamerica by requiring the minority interests in the operating partnership to be presented as a noncontrolling interest as a component of equity statement 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  midamericas primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on our secured and unsecured borrowings at december 31 2007 48 of midamericas total capitalization consisted of borrowings midamericas interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective midamerica manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings midamerica uses our best efforts to ladder fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year midamerica does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes approximately 82 of midamericas outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments with a weighted average of 55 at december 31 2007 midamerica regularly reviews interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations

  midamerica’s business is conducted principally through midamerica apartments lp which we refer to as our operating partnership midamerica is the sole general partner of the operating partnership holding 258990 common units of partnership interest or common units comprising a 1 general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december 31 2006 midamerica’s whollyowned qualified reit subsidiary mac ii of delaware inc a delaware corporation is a limited partner in the operating partnership and as of december 31 2006 held 23028923 common units or 8892 of all outstanding common units 

  midamerica operated apartment communities in 13 states in 2006 employing 1164 full time and 105 part time employees at december 31 2006 

operating philosophy 

  midamerica’s primary objectives are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle and to create new shareholder value by growing midamerica in a disciplined manner midamerica focuses on growing shareholder value by effectively and efficiently operating its existing investments and when accretive to shareholder value through new investments 

investment focus 

  midamerica’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the sunbelt region of the united states between 1994 and 1997 midamerica grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities between 1998 and 2002 its concentration was on development of new communities since 2003 we have focused on the acquisition of properties that we believe can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and our operating management skills we are currently focusing on increasing our investments in properties in larger and faster growing markets within our current geographic area and intend to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth on a small scale midamerica is developing expansions at existing communities we will continue our established process of selling mature assets and will adapt our investment focus to opportunities and markets in order to improve our return on investment we have from timetotime invested with joint venture partners and anticipate this will continue to be part of our strategy 

high quality assets 

  midamerica strives to maintain its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment midamerica believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher 

rents and profitability and evidences the high quality of its properties and operations midamerica periodically and selectively sells assets to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within its market area 

diversified market focus 

  we believe the stability of our cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow returns with lower volatility through our diversified strategy of investments over large middle and smalltier markets throughout the sunbelt region of the united states 

intensive property and asset management focus 

  midamerica has traditionally emphasized property management and in the past three years we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing training ancillary income and most recently revenue management at december 31 2006 midamerica employed approximately 106 certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals we have enhanced our focus on asset management over the last several years by increasing regional staffing in the areas of maintenance capital improvement oversight landscaping marketing and pricing management 

decentralized operational structure 

  midamerica operates in a decentralized manner we believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations in 2004 midamerica completed the installation of the property and accounting modules of a new webbased property management system that increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis improving the support provided to onsite property operations in 2005 we made significant improvements to our operating platform and we expect these enhancements will help capture more operating efficiencies continue to support effective expense control and provide for various expanded revenue management practices in 2006 we successfully completed an extensive test and evaluation of a new “yield management” pricing program that we plan to implement across the portfolio during 2007 which we expect will help our property managers to optimize rental revenues 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

  midamerica focuses on improving the value of each share of midamerica common stock we routinely evaluate each asset and from timetotime sell those that no longer fit our strategy midamerica makes new investments and issues new equity when management believes it can add to value per share in the past midamerica has sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

strategies 

  midamerica seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

operating growth strategy 

  midamerica’s goal is to maximize our return on investment in each apartment community by increasing rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

providing realtime information through technology innovations such as the implementation of midamerica’s new webbased property management system that shares information between properties and management 4 

implementing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market conditions   developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents including telephone cable and internet access on which midamerica generates fee and commission income   implementing programs to control expenses through investment in costsaving initiatives such as the installation of individual apartment unit water and utility meters in certain apartment communities   analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas   proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property   improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning apartment communities from timetotime to maintain market leadership positions   compensating employees through performancebased compensation and stock ownership programs   maintaining a handson management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior management’s continued close contact with the market and employees   selling or exchanging underperforming assets   repurchasing or issuing shares of common or preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit   aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing and   allocating additional capital including capital for selective interior improvements where the investment will generate the highest returns for midamerica joint venture strategy 

  one of midamerica’s strategies is to coinvest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities from timetotime to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees which leverage our skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for midamerica 

disposition strategy 

  midamerica from timetotime disposes of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically midamerica selects assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs midamerica may from timetotime also dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above no apartment communities were sold during 2006 

acquisition strategy 

  one of midamerica’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and focus as discussed above midamerica has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities in addition midamerica will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis midamerica will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states 

  the following apartment communities were purchased during 2006 

 

development strategy 

  in 2006 midamerica began some expansion development projects at existing apartment communities on adjacent land already owned by us we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way we prefer to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new properties 

common and preferred stock 

  midamerica continuously reviews opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing value per share midamerica evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below the value of our assets and accordingly repurchased common stock funded by asset sales between 1999 and 2001 midamerica also looks for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when it will add to shareholder value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital midamerica will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as we did in 2003 and 2006 

  in may 2006 midamerica sold 1150000 shares of common stock through a public offering receiving net proceeds of 595 million midamerica used 10 million to redeem all of our issued and outstanding 8 58 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock shares on may 26 2006 

  on november 3 2006 midamerica entered into a sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald  co to sell up to 2000000 shares of midamerica’s common stock from timetotime in atthemarket offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity offering program from november 3 2006 until the end of 2006 midamerica sold 194000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of 114 million after underwriting commissions and sec fees 

  midamerica also has a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges we in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 throughout 2006 we issued a total of 1356015 shares through our direct stock purchase plan at an average 15 discount

  in 1999 midamerica’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of midamerica’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2006 midamerica had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from timetotime we intend to sell assets based on our disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2006 under this plan 

competition 

  all of midamerica’s apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than midamerica and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than midamerica’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

  apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition midamerica makes capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

  as part of the acquisition process midamerica obtains environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before midamerica takes ownership of an acquisition community however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

  under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

  midamerica is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold midamerica has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease midamerica has also purchased a 2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2007 but is renewable at that time midamerica therefore believes that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

  the environmental studies received by midamerica have not revealed any material environmental liabilities midamerica is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which midamerica is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

  midamerica believes that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

recent developments 

distribution 

  in february 2007 midamerica announced a monthly distribution to our series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock shareholders of 01927 per share which is payable on march 15 2007 

dispositions 

  on january 12 2007 the sole property in midamerica’s joint venture with crow holdings verandas at timberglen a 522unit community in dallas tx was sold in conjunction with the sale midamerica sold our ownership interest in the joint venture to crow holdings as a result midamerica booked a gain on sale of 54 million and an incentive fee of 1 million both of which will be recorded in midamerica’s 2007 consolidated financial statements following these transactions midamerica had no joint venture interests 




 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to pay distributions to shareholders 

  midamerica’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and preferred dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of midamerica’s apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control such events or conditions could include 

competition from other apartment communities   overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in midamerica’s markets which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates andor require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units   increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset by increased rents   midamerica’s inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance 8 

changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing   an uninsured loss resulting from a catastrophic storm or act of terrorism   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available or increase midamerica’s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing and   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments   at times midamerica relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program including our existing property expansion developments while midamerica has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event midamerica would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in midamerica’s funds from operations could adversely affect midamerica’s ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on midamerica’s stock price 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

  at december 31 2006 midamerica had total debt outstanding of 12 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave midamerica with insufficient cash resources to operate the apartment communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for midamerica to maintain our qualification as a reit midamerica currently intends to limit our total debt to approximately 60 of the undepreciated book value of our assets although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels circumstances may cause midamerica to exceed that target from timetotime as of december 31 2006 midamerica’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 52 midamerica’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow midamerica to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition midamerica must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect midamerica’s financial condition andor our funds from operations midamerica relies on fannie mae and freddie mac which we refer to as the agencies for the majority of our debt financing and has agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants the breach of any one of these covenants would place midamerica in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences on the operations of midamerica 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

  at december 31 2006 effectively 226 million of midamerica’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps midamerica may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect midamerica’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders midamerica’s 10 billion secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fannie mae are predominately floating rate facilities midamerica also has credit facilities with freddie mac totaling 300 million which are variable rate facilities at december 31 2006 a total of 988 million was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates midamerica was exposed to at december 31 2006 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps midamerica will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment communities dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions midamerica cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans midamerica may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly midamerica could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

  because midamerica has substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its apartment communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of midamerica if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise midamerica’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and midamerica’s ability to pay our dividend could be affected 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  midamerica carries comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intends to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes are subject to limitations and thus may be uninsured midamerica exercises our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if midamerica suffers a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

property insurance limits may be inadequate and deductibles may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses and may cause a breach of a loan covenant 

  midamerica has a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to the new madrid earthquake zone a major wind or earthquake loss or series of losses could require that midamerica pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the 40 million per occurrence limit of midamerica’s insurance for these risks midamerica may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on midamerica’s assets financial condition and results of operation 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

  midamerica intends to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental operations midamerica may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position additionally to grow successfully midamerica must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties midamerica must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

midamerica may not be able to sell communities when appropriate 

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly midamerica may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor is midamerica aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past four years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements midamerica cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to midamerica or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require midamerica to modify our existing communities these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require midamerica to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on midamerica with respect to improved access by disabled persons midamerica cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital stock 

  our charter limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 99 of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock both common and preferred the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing reit status this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons applying certain broad attribution rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code owning 50 or more of our shares if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits we 

will consider the transfer to be null and void   will not reflect the transaction on our books   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares   will consider the shares held in trust for our benefit and   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to us or we will redeem the shares if we redeem the shares you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of  11 

   if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above 

you may lose your power to dispose of the shares   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases and   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases provisions of our charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

ownership limit 

  the 99 ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors 

preferred stock 

  our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests currently we have the following amounts of preferred stock issued and outstanding 

474500 shares of 9 14 series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock   6200000 shares of 830 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock tennessee antitakeover statutes 

  as a tennessee corporation we are subject to various legislative acts which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

  investments in joint ventures may involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

the potential inability of our joint venture partner to perform   the joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to ours   the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies and   the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating to the property they jointly own   although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause midamerica to be taxed as a corporation 

  if midamerica fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes midamerica will be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that midamerica fails to qualify as a reit midamerica would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate 

rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions midamerica would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status midamerica might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

failure to make required distributions would subject midamerica to income taxation 

  in order to qualify as a reit each year midamerica must distribute to stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains to the extent that midamerica satisfies the distribution requirement but distributes less than 100 of taxable income it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income in addition midamerica will incur a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions in any year are less than the sum of 

85 of ordinary income for that year   95 of capital gain net income for that year and   100 of undistributed taxable income from prior years   differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require midamerica to borrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 

complying with reit requirements may cause midamerica to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities 

  to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes midamerica must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of income the nature and diversification of assets the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of midamerica’s stock in order to meet these tests midamerica may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder midamerica’s ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits

       midamerica’s quarterly dividend rate is currently 0605 per common share the board of directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly actual dividends made by midamerica will be affected by a number of factors including the gross revenues received from the apartment communities the operating expenses of midamerica the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures 

  midamerica expects to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders however future distributions by midamerica will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the actual funds from operations of midamerica our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 

  midamerica has established the direct stock purchase and distribution reinvestment plan or drspp under which holders of common stock preferred stock and limited partnership interests in midamerica apartments lp can elect automatically to reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock the plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least 250 but not more than 5000 in any given month free of brokerage commissions and charges midamerica in our absolute discretion may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of 5000 to fulfill our obligations under the drspp midamerica may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market midamerica may elect to sell shares under the drspp at up to a 5 discount

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

  this and other sections of this annual report on form 10k contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated market conditions expected growth rates of revenues and expenses planned asset dispositions disposition pricing planned acquisitions developments and renovations property financings expected interest rates joint venture activity and planned capital expenditures although midamerica believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements 

included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by midamerica or any other person that the objectives and plans of midamerica will be achieved 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon midamerica’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires midamerica to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis midamerica evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances midamerica believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  midamerica believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

revenue recognition 

  midamerica leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rent and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings other expense reimbursements and administrative application and other fees charged to residents interest management fees and all other sources of income are recognized as earned 

  midamerica records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

  midamerica carries real estate assets at depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by midamerica in order to elevate the condition of the property to midamerica’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  midamerica accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  or statement 144 and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  or statement 142 midamerica evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in midamerica’s fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified midamerica periodically evaluates longlived assets including investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

  in accordance with statement 144 longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected 

to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

  goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first midamerica determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate midamerica determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement no 141 business combinations  the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

  midamerica utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with midamerica’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended requires midamerica to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

  in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while midamerica’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by midamerica before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

  midamerica measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

overview of the year ended december 31 2006 

  midamerica’s results for 2006 were positively influenced by both improved operating performance from communities held throughout both the current and prior period or same store and the positive impact from acquisitions in recent years strong economic growth and job formation enabled midamerica to improve our same store occupancy and average rental rates from the prior year 

  midamerica has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states midamerica acquired six properties in 2004 and three properties in 2005 for which it benefited from full years of revenues in 2006 midamerica acquired an additional six properties during 2006 

  midamerica experienced an increase in interest expense in 2006 as our total debt outstanding and average borrowing costs both increased from prior year levels 

  the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of midamerica for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by approximately 29982000 from the year ended december 31 2005 due to i a 9538000 increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006 or the 2006 acquisitions ii a 5312000 increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005 or the 2005 acquisitions and iii a 15132000 increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an average 31 increase in average rent per unit in 2006 over 2005 

  property operating expenses include costs for property personnel building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance utilities landscaping and other property related costs property operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by approximately 10653000 from the year ended december 31 2005 due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of i 4438000 from the 2006 acquisitions ii 1913000 from the 2005 acquisitions and iii 4302000 from the properties held throughout both periods the increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of midamerica’s same store portfolio and was driven by an increase in property insurance reflecting the increase in premiums effective july 1 2006 the same store property operating expense increase also reflects increased utility rates as midamerica experienced an increase in electricity natural gas and water and sewer prices 

  depreciation expense increased by approximately 4975000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 2711000 from the 2006 acquisitions ii 1183000 from the 2005 acquisitions and iii 4101000 from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 3020000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of six communities acquired by midamerica in 2004 

  property management expenses increased by approximately 1206000 from the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2006 partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 1532000 over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance 

  interest expense increased approximately 5070000 in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2005 and the increase in midamerica’s twelvemonth average borrowing cost from 52 for 2005 to 55 for 2006 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 3034000 from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of midamerica the sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 1723000 in 2005 midamerica had no dispositions in 2006 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 midamerica recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately 749000 mainly related to insurance settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of midamerica’s communities for the year ended december 31 2006 midamerica recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds of approximately 84000 

  primarily as a result of the foregoing net income increased by approximately 1201000 in 2006 over 2005 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

  property revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by approximately 30260000 from the year ended december 31 2004 due to i a 12871000 increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2004 or the 2004 acquisitions ii a 8204000 increase in property revenues from the 2005 acquisitions and iii a 9185000 increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods

  depreciation expense increased by approximately 6403000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of i 2921000 from the 2004 acquisitions ii 2084000 from the 2005 acquisitions and iii 4596000 from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 3198000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of 13 communities acquired by midamerica in 2003 

  property management expenses increased by approximately 1514000 from the year ended december 31 2004 to the year ended december 31 2005 partially due to increased personnel expenses and incentive compensation both related to property acquisitions general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 1114000 over this same period property management expenses and general and administrative expenses for 2005 were both impacted by a cumulative charge to amortize four years of a ten year senior management incentive plan which midamerica previously expected would expense from 2007 through 2011 

  interest expense increased approximately 7759000 in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2004 and the increase in midamerica’s twelvemonth average borrowing cost from 51 for 2004 to 52 for 2005 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 midamerica recorded total gains of approximately 3034000 from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of midamerica the sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to midamerica of approximately 1723000 in 2005 for the year ended december 31 2004 midamerica recorded a total of approximately 9074000 in gains from two community sales of which approximately 3249000 represented midamerica’s share of the gain from the sale of a community which was owned by a joint venture of midamerica 

  in 2005 and 2004 midamerica refinanced the debt on several communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment in 2005 this resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 409000 due to the writeoff of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties in 2004 midamerica recorded a gain of approximately 1095000 related to the early extinguishment of debt 

  for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 midamerica recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately 749000 mainly related to insurance settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of midamerica’s communities and 2683000 mainly related to insurance settlements from fires at some of midamerica’s communities respectively 

  primarily as a result of the foregoing net income decreased by approximately 5454000 in 2005 over 2004 

funds from operations 

  funds from operations or ffo represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gain on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

  in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock midamerica has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our ffo calculation 

  midamerica’s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity midamerica believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding midamerica’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets midamerica believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies midamerica’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 dollars and shares in thousands 

   ffo increases for both 2006 over 2005 and 2005 over 2004 were principally the result of improved community operations from midamerica’s same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2004 acquisitions 2005 acquisitions and 2006 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above 

trends 

  in 2006 community performance showed the benefit of improving market conditions which was strong throughout most of midamerica’s markets areas that had been weak for several years especially atlanta dallas and austin showed improved demand 

  midamerica believes that the primary driver of demand by apartment residents is job formation and this continued to show solid momentum in most of midamerica’s larger metro areas some of the smaller and midsize markets in which midamerica operates such as jackson ms jacksonville fl and columbus ga remained reasonably strong during the market downturn that preceded this period and continued to show solid performance at the same time midamerica has noticed that in some of our markets supply pressures have been surprisingly muted and we believe that several factors are at work in some markets especially in florida some apartment communities 

have been taken off the rental market and converted to condominiums construction and development costs for new apartments also seem to have risen substantially for a variety of reasons and this has made the economics of building apartments to compete with midamerica’s communities less attractive rising interest rates have impacted developers’ costs and this may also have reduced the amount of competition that we face from singlefamily homes the cooling of housing markets may also have caused some first time home buyers to delay their purchases 

  midamerica faces cost pressures from increasing operating expenses especially insurance and real estate tax costs as well as increasing prices on materials that we use in maintaining our apartments 

  midamerica believes that the current conditions of improved demand a reduced rate of increase in supply and reduced competition from single family homes while somewhat offset by rising expenses will continue to contribute to better operating results in the near future 

liquidity and capital resources 

  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 1900000 to 101326000 for 2006 compared to 99426000 for 2005 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2006 net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately 11724000 to 99426000 for 2005 compared to 87702000 for 2004 mainly related to the growth of midamerica through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2005 

  net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately 132957000 from 107391000 in 2005 to 240348000 in 2006 net cash used in investing activities was 167302000 in 2004 the change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity a total of approximately 194970000 was invested in 2006 to acquire properties this compares to approximately 105643000 in 2005 and 155088000 in 2004 midamerica began limited development activities in 2006 which used net cash of approximately 10919000 and expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately 6077000 in 2006 compared to only 426000 in 2005 and none in 2004 

  net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately 117607000 to 130503000 in 2006 from 12896000 in 2005 net cash provided by financing activities was 79938000 in 2004 cash provided from credit lines and notes payable increased approximately 29449000 from approximately 57079000 in 2005 to 86528000 in 2006 cash provided from credit lines and notes payable was approximately 280930000 in 2004 principal payments on notes payable increased to approximately 29862000 in 2006 from 10921000 in 2005 principal payments on notes payable were approximately 152046000 in 2004 midamerica had fewer refinancings in 2006 and 2005 than in 2004 proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately 152286000 primarily due to midamerica’s raising of funds through stock issuances through our direct stock purchase plan a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2005 from 2004 to approximately 38759000 mainly related to midamerica’s use of our direct stock purchase plan 

  the weighted average interest rate at december 31 2006 for the 12 billion of debt outstanding was 56 compared to 54 on 11 billion of debt outstanding at december 31 2005 midamerica utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities midamerica utilizes fixed rate borrowings interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk more details on midamerica’s borrowings can be found in the schedule on page 31 

  at december 31 2006 midamerica had secured credit facilities relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association or fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac and a group of banks led by amsouth bank together these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of 14 billion at december 31 2006 with an availability to borrow of 12 billion at december 31 2006 midamerica had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 992 million 

  approximately 71 of midamerica’s outstanding obligations at december 31 2006 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma which we call the fnma facilities the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 10 billion all of which was available to borrow at december 31 2006 various traunches of the facilities mature from 2010 through 2014 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate 

borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security or dmbs rate on the date of renewal which has typically approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 005 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 062 to 0795 

  each of midamerica’s secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and are subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if midamerica were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect midamerica’s liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if midamerica were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect on midamerica 

  on may 26 2005 midamerica gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8 58 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series g” on may 26 2006 for the total redemption price of 10 million as a result in accordance with statement no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  midamerica classified the series g as a liability within notes payable as of may 26 2005 on the accompanying consolidated financial statements on may 26 2006 midamerica redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series g 

  as of december 31 2006 midamerica had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately 679 million to date these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges midamerica also had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately 42 million in effect as of december 31 2006 

  summary details of the debt outstanding at december 31 2006 follows in the table below 

   during 2006 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 1340000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 77 million in proceeds during 2005 midamerica offered an average 15 discount through our drspp and issued approximately 784000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 32 million in proceeds during 2004 midamerica offered an average discount of 20 from august through december through our drspp for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 midamerica issued approximately 392000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan generating approximately 151 million in proceeds 

  in may 2006 midamerica sold 1150000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately 595 million midamerica also sold 194000 shares of common stock in december 2006 through our continuous equity offering plan generating approximately 114 million in net proceeds 

  midamerica believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations and annual refurbishment of our communities through our cash flow and credit facilities midamerica is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma which provides credit enhancement for approximately 844 million of midamerica’s debt the interest rate market for fnma dmbs which in midamerica’s experience is highly correlated with threemonth libor interest rates is also an important component of midamerica’s liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient or the credit of fnma becomes impaired midamerica would seek alternative sources of debt financing 

  for the year ended december 31 2006 midamerica’s net cash provided by operating activities fell short of covering improvements to existing real estate assets excluding renovations distributions to unitholders and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately 49 million this compares to excess coverage in 2005 of approximately 27 million and a shortfall for 2004 of approximately 103 million while midamerica has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates from timetotime midamerica may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary any significant deterioration in operations could result in midamerica’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event midamerica would be required to reduce the distribution rate 

  the following table reflects midamerica’s total contractual cash obligations which consist of our longterm debt and operating leases as of december 31 2006 dollars in 000’s 

     offbalance sheet arrangements 

  at december 31 2006 and 2005 midamerica did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as “structured finance” or “special purpose entities” established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes midamerica’s joint venture with blackstone terminated in 2003 was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in ffo from the sale share repurchases and other capital requirements midamerica’s two joint ventures with crow holdings one terminated in 2005 and one in 2007 were established to acquire approximately 200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance midamerica’s return on investment through the generation of fee income in addition midamerica does not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such midamerica is not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships midamerica does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with midamerica or our related parties other than what is disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements note 14 

  midamerica’s investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as midamerica does not have a controlling interest 

insurance 

  management believes that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks midamerica renegotiated our insurance programs july 1 2006 and because of the significant reduction in available insurance for windstorm events and resulting large 

increase in cost purchased property insurance with limits reduced from prior years midamerica selfinsures the first 500000 of individual property losses and if greater the first 10 of property losses caused by named windstorms and earthquakes with a limit per event of 40 million for windstorm and earthquake damage according to midamerica’s risk consultant approximately 20 of midamerica’s property value is located in “wind tier 1” risk areas predominately certain parts of florida and 12 in the new madrid earthquake risk zone midamerica does not own any direct coastal frontage property the largest loss event from windstorm damage tornado midamerica has experienced was 39 million in 1999 midamerica experienced combined total losses of 22 million from windstorms in 2004 and 2005 with the biggest loss 11 million from hurricane francis in 2004 midamerica’s insurance program is subject to review by our principal lenders 

inflation 

  substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable midamerica to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to midamerica of the adverse effects of inflation 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

  in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or interpretation 48 interpretation 48 provides clarification concerning the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an enterprise’s financial statement in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  interpretation 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 midamerica does not believe the adoption of interpretation 48 will have a material impact on midamerica’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 

  in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements  or statement 157 statement 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years midamerica does not believe the adoption of statement 157 will have a material impact on midamerica’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  midamerica’s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on our secured and unsecured borrowings at december 31 2006 41 of midamerica’s total capitalization consisted of borrowings midamerica’s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve this objective midamerica manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings midamerica uses our best efforts to ladder fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year midamerica does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes approximately 81 of midamerica’s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates after considering related derivative instruments with a weighted average of 55 at december 31 2006 midamerica regularly reviews interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

  the table below provides information about midamerica’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for midamerica’s interest rate swaps and caps the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they expire weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date dollars in 000’s

investment focus  the company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the southeastern united states between 1994 and 1997 the company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities between 1998 and 2002 its concentration was on development of new communities the company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be 

repositioned with appropriate use of capital and its operating management skills the company is currently focusing on increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster growing markets within its current geographic area and intends to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth on a small scale the company is beginning to develop expansions at existing communities the company will continue its established process of selling mature assets and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets 

high quality assets  the company strives to maintain its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment it believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability and further supports the high quality of its properties and operations the company periodically and selectively sells assets to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated properties within its market area 

diversified market focus  the company believes the stability of its cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow returns with lower volatility through its diversified strategy of investments over large middle and smalltier markets throughout the southeastern united states 

intensive management focus  the company strongly emphasizes onsite property management particular attention is paid to opportunities to increase rents raise average occupancy rates and control costs property managers area managers and regional managers are given the responsibility for monitoring market trends and the discretion to react to such trends the company as part of its intense management focus has established a number of training programs to produce highly competent property managers leasing consultants and service technicians who work onsite at the company’s apartment communities the “communities” to generate the highest possible income from the company’s assets at december 31 2005 the company employed approximately 103 certified apartment managers a designation established by the national apartment association which provides training for onsite manager professionals the company has enhanced its focus on asset management over the last several years by increasing regional staffing in the areas of maintenance capital improvement oversight landscaping marketing and pricing management 

decentralized operational structure  the company operates in a decentralized manner management believes that its decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations in 2004 the company completed the installation of the property and accounting modules of a new webbased property management system that increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis improving the support provided to onsite property operations in 2005 the company made significant improvements to its operating platform and expects these enhancements will help capture more operating efficiencies continue to support effective expense control and provide for various expanded revenue management practices 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

the company focuses on improving the value of each share of the company’s common stock it routinely evaluates each asset and sells those that no longer fit its strategy the company makes new investments and issues new equity when management believes it can add to value per share in the past the company has sold assets to fund share repurchases when in management’s view shareholder value would be enhanced 

strategies 

the company seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

operating growth strategy  management’s goal is to maximize the company’s return on investment in each community by increasing rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

            joint venture strategy  one of the company’s strategies is to coinvest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities from time to time to the extent the company believes that a joint venture will enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management and other fees which leverage the company’s skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for the company the company is currently invested in a joint venture with crow holdings that was established in early 2004 

disposition strategy  the company from time to time disposes of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet the company’s investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically the company selects assets for disposition that do not meet its present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs the company may from time to time also dispose of assets for which the company receives an offer meeting or exceeding its return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above 

the following communities were sold during 2005 

 

 acquisition strategy  one of the company’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its investment criteria and focus as discussed above the company has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily properties in addition the company will acquire newly built and developed properties that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis the company will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of properties in strong and growing markets in the southeast 

the following communities were purchased during 2005 

 development strategy  in late 1997 the company’s emphasis shifted from acquisitions to development because of its belief that under thencurrent market conditions such development would generate higher quality assets and higher longterm investment returns in 1999 management decided to exit the construction and development business upon completion of the company’s existing development pipeline after determining that market conditions were changing making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the company’s profitability targets over the next few years in 2002 the company completed the 300 million construction program of high quality apartments 

at december 31 2005 the company had no properties in development 

in 2006 the company plans to begin some expansion development projects at existing communities on adjacent land currently owned by the company the company does not currently intend to return to development in a significant way preferring to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new properties 

common and preferred stock 

the company continuously reviews opportunities for lowering its cost of capital and increasing value per share the company evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when it believes that its stock price is below the value of its assets and accordingly repurchased common stock funded by asset sales between 1999 and 2001 the company also looks for opportunities where it can acquire or develop communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when it will add to shareholder value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed its cost of capital the company will also opportunistically seek to lower its cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as it did in 2003 

on may 26 2005 the company gave the required oneyear notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding 8 58 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock shares on may 26 2006 at a total redemption price of 10 million 

share repurchase program 

in 1999 the company’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of the company’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2005 the company had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from time to time the company intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2005 under this plan 

competition 

all of the company’s communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the company and the managers of these communities may have more experience than the company’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition the company makes capital improvements to both the communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

as part of the acquisition process the company obtains environmental studies on all of its communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before the company takes ownership of an acquisition property however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

the company is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold the company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease the company has also purchased a 2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2007 but is renewable at that time the company therefore believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

the environmental studies received by the company have not revealed any material environmental liabilities the company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

the company believes that its communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and preferred dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of the company’s properties may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond the company’s control such events or conditions could include 

         at times the company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and its capital investment program including its existing property expansion developments while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if necessary any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in the company’s 

funds from operations could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to its shareholders or to meet its loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

debt level refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results 

at december 31 2005 the company had total debt outstanding of 114 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit the company currently intends to limit its total debt to approximately 60 of the undepreciated book value of its assets although the company’s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time as of december 31 2005 the company’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 56 the company’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders in addition the company must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company’s financial condition andor its funds from operations the company relies on fannie mae and freddie mac the “agencies” for the majority of its debt financing and has agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require it to comply with certain covenants the breach of any one of these covenants would place the company in default with its lenders and may have serious consequences on the operations of the company 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

at december 31 2005 effectively 173 million of the company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps an additional 25 million also bore interest at a variable rate at december 31 2005 but was hedged by an interest rate swap that became operative in february 2006 the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect the company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders the company’s 950 million secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fannie mae are predominately floating rate facilities the company also has a 100 million credit facility with freddie mac which is a variable rate facility at december 31 2005 a total of 9078 million was outstanding under these facilities these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates the company was exposed to at december 31 2005 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions the company cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans the company may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

because the company has substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the company if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise the company’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and the company’s ability to pay its dividend could be affected 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

the company carries comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties which the company believes is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties the company acquires in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to limitations the company exercises its discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if the company suffers a substantial loss its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies 

the company intends to actively acquire and improve multifamily properties for rental operations the company may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position additionally to grow successfully the company must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties the company must also be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our overall profitability 

the company may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly the company may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause the company to be taxed as a corporation 

if the company fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes the company will be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification for any taxable year that the company fails to qualify as a reit the company would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions the company would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status the company might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the 

owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor is the company aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity over the past four years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require the company to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require the company to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the company cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws which may be substantial 

our investments in joint ventures may involve risks 

investments in joint ventures may involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as 

    although each joint owner will have a right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest in the event a sale is desired the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise such right of first refusal

  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated market conditions expected growth rates of revenues and expenses planned asset dispositions disposition pricing planned acquisitions and developments property financings expected interest rates and planned capital expenditures although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

revenue recognition 

the company leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straightline basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 

the company records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with statement no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software all of which are subjective determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets “statement 144” and evaluates its goodwill 

for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “statement 142” the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

in accordance with statement 144 longlived assets such as real estate assets equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement no 141 business combinations  the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with the company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 133 as amended requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while the company’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

the company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

overview of the year ended december 31 2005

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or “gaap” excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gain on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock the company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its ffo calculation 

the company’s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding the company’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars and shares in thousands 

 ffo increased during 2005 by approximately 7389000 to 77414000 versus 70025000 in 2004 principally because of improved operation results both from the company’s same store portfolio and the addition of properties from the 2004 acquisitions and 2005 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above ffo increased during 2004 by approximately 14658000 to 70025000 versus 55367000 in 2003 principally because of the addition of properties through the bremaac buyout and 2003 acquisitions and 2004 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above ffo for 2003 included a charge of 5987000 for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock 

trends 

property performance over the past four years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company’s markets but has begun to show signs of improvement 

the company believes that demand by apartment renters is most impacted by household formation which is driven by job formation job formation has been quite weak in many of the company’s markets and most noticeably in the larger metro areas such as atlanta houston and dallas some of the smaller and midsize markets in which the company operates such as jackson mississippi jacksonville florida and columbus georgia have been less impacted 

on the supply side low interest rates encouraged overbuilding of apartments especially in the larger metropolitan areas delivery of new apartment units during this period of weakened apartment demand increased competition reducing apartment occupancy levels especially in the larger markets in addition singlefamily homes which are direct competition for apartments became even more affordable and home ownership continued to climb in the company’s markets 

in 2005 the company began to see a turn in many of its markets particularly in florida and georgia where there are some signs of improving demand coupled with a slight slow down in supply the company’s largetier markets which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn are beginning to show signs of absorbing the oversupply of new apartments and returning to historical occupancy and pricing levels while the company’s smaller tier and midsized markets are benefiting from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth the policies of the federal reserve which has raised shortterm interest rates by 300 basis points in a short span of time also seem to be having some early impact 

on the supply of new apartments development costs of apartments and of singlefamily homes also appear to be rising as are mortgage interest rates with the likelihood that this may slightly alleviate this competition 

the company believes that the impact of higher demand from apartment renters a reduced rate of increase in supply and reduced competition from singlefamily homes will contribute to better operating results in 2006 while rising interest rates will also increase the company’s cost of borrowing the company has mitigated part of the impact of this by putting in place 25 million of forward swap such that the interest rate on approximately 87 of its debt has been fixed swapped forward swapped or capped compared to 81 at the end of 2004

at december 31 2005 the company had secured credit facilities relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association “fnma” fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” and a group of banks led by amsouth bank together these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of 11 billion at december 31 2005 with an availability to borrow of 10 billion at december 31 2005 the company had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of 920 million 

approximately 71 of the company’s outstanding obligations at december 31 2005 were borrowed through facilities withor credit enhanced by fnma the “fnma facilities” the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of 950 million 881 million of which was available to borrow at december 31 2005 various traunches of the facilities mature from 2010 through 2014 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security “dmbs” rate on the date of renewal 

which has typically approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 004 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 062 to 0795 

each of the company’s secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage and are subject to periodic reevaluation of collateral if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced moreover if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as “structured finance” or “special purpose entities” established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually

insurance 

in the opinion of management property and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity financial position or results of operations 

inflation 

substantially all of the resident leases at the communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29 “statement 153” statement 153 was a result of a joint effort by the fasb and the iasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards statement 153 amends apb opinion no 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange statement 153 is applied prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of statement 153 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole

in march 2005 the sec issued sab 107 to provide public companies additional guidance in applying the provisions of statement 123r among other things sab 107 describes the sec staff’s expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of statement 123r with certain existing sec guidance the guidance is also beneficial to users of financial statements in 

analyzing the information provided under statement 123r sab 107 will be applied upon the adoption of statement 123r 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligationsan interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “interpretation 47” interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  “statement 143” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity interpretation 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 december 31 2005 for calendaryear enterprises retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but is not required the adoption of interpretation 47 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole 

in june 2005 the fasb ratified eitf 045 determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights “eitf 045” eitf 045 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner is required to consolidate limited partners the new framework is significantly different than the guidance in sop 789 and would make it more difficult for a general partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership requiring the limited partner to have substantive “kickout” or “participating” rights kickout rights are the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or to otherwise remove the general partner without cause and participating rights are the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the partnership’s business eitf 045 became effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships which are modified the guidance will become effective for existing limited partnerships which are not modified the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the company does not believe the adoption of eitf 045 will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole

operating philosophy 

the company’s primary objective is to maintain a stable cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle the company focuses on growing through its existing investments and when accretive to cash flow and shareholder value through external investments 

investment focus the company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the southeastern united states and texas between 1994 and 1997 the company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities between 1998 and 2000 its concentration was on development of new communities the company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and its operating management skills the company is also interested in increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster growing markets within its current market area to balance its portfolio between small middle and largetier markets and intends to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth the company will continue its established process of selling mature assets and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets 

high quality assets the company maintains its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment it believes that being recognized 

by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability and further supports the high quality of its properties and operations the company periodically sells assets selectively in order to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality welllocated assets within its market area 

diversified market focus the company believes the stability of its cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow returns with lower volatility through its diversified strategy of investments over large middle and smalltier markets throughout the southeastern united states and texas 

intensive management focus the company strongly emphasizes onsite property management particular attention is paid to opportunities to increase rents raise average occupancy rates and control costs property managers and regional managers are given the responsibility for monitoring market trends and the discretion to react to such trends the company as part of its intense management focus has established a number of training programs to produce highly competent property managers leasing consultants and service technicians who work onsite at the company’s apartment communities the “communities” to generate the highest possible income from the company’s assets at december 31 2004 the company employed approximately 106 certified apartment managers “cam” the cam designation is sponsored through the national apartment association and provides training for onsite manager professionals 

decentralized operational structure the company operates in a decentralized manner management believes that its decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management along with various asset management functions are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent onsite visitations in 2004 the company completed the installation of the property and general ledger modules of a new webbased property management system that increases the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties and does so on a real time basis improving the support provided to the operating environment the company plans to install the purchase order module in 2005 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

the company focuses on maximizing the return on assets and adding to the intrinsic underlying value of each share of the company’s common stock routinely reviewing each asset based on its determined value and selling those which no longer fit its investment criteria the company constantly evaluates the effectiveness of its capital allocations and makes adjustments to its strategy including investing in existing and new apartment communities debt retirement and repurchases or issuances of shares of the company’s preferred and common stock 

strategies 

the company seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

operating growth strategy management’s goal is to maximize the company’s return on investment in each community by increasing rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels the company seeks higher net rental revenues by enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the communities and managing expenses through its system of detailed management reporting and accountability in order to achieve increases in operating cash flow the steps taken to meet these objectives include

       joint venture strategy one of the company’s strategies is to coinvest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities from time to time which enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management fees which leverages the company’s recognized skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments in addition the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for the company the company is currently involved in two joint ventures with crow holdings one established in 2002 and the second in early 2004 

disposition strategy the company is committed to the selective disposition of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet the company’s investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically the company selects assets for disposition that do not meet its present investment criteria including future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs the company may from time to time also dispose of assets for which the company receives an offer meeting or exceeding its return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above 

the following communities were sold during 2004 

 acquisition strategy one of the company’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its investment criteria and focus as discussed above the company has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily properties in addition the company will acquire newly built and developed properties that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis the company will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of properties in strong and growing markets in the southeast and texas 

the following communities were purchased during 2004 

 development strategy in late 1997 the company’s emphasis shifted from acquisitions to development because of its belief that under thencurrent market conditions such development would generate higher quality assets and higher longterm investment returns in 2002 the company completed a 300 million construction program of high quality apartments in several markets in 1999 management decided to exit the construction and development business upon completion of the company’s existing development pipeline after determining that market conditions were changing making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the company’s profitability targets over the next few years 

at december 31 2004 the company had no properties in development the company periodically evaluates opportunities for profitable future development investments 

common and preferred stock 

the company continuously reviews opportunities for lowering its cost of capital and increasing value per share the company evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when it believes that its stock price is below the value of its assets and accordingly repurchased common stock funded by asset sales between 1999 and 2001 the company also looks for opportunities where it can acquire or develop communities selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales when it will add to shareholder value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed its cost of capital the company will also opportunistically seek to lower its cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as it did in 2003 

share repurchase program 

in 1999 the company’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of the company’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2004 the company had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from time to time the company intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments no shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2004 under this plan 

competition 

all of the company’s communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the company and the managers of these communities may have more experience than the company’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition the company makes capital improvements to both the communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

as part of the acquisition process the company generally obtains environmental studies on all of its communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before the company takes ownership of an acquisition property however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

the company is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold the company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease the company has also purchased a 2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2007 but is renewable at that time the company therefore believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

the environmental studies received by the company have not revealed any material environmental liabilities the company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

the company believes that its communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses planned asset dispositions disposition pricing planned acquisition and developments property financings and expected interest rates although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 

the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company’s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control 

the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of the company’s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company’s control such events or conditions could include 

          currently the company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to reduce the distribution rate any decline in the company’s 

 debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results 

at december 31 2004 the company had total debt outstanding of 1083 billion payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit the company currently intends to limit its total debt to approximately 60 of the undepreciated book value of its assets although the company’s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time as of december 31 2004 the company’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 56 the company’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders in addition the company must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company’s financial condition andor its funds from operations 

variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations 

at december 31 2004 effectively 2016 million of the company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps an additional 50 million also bore interest at a variable rate at december 31 2004 but was hedged by an interest rate swap that becomes operative in may 2005 in addition the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variablerate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect the company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders 

the company’s 950 million secured credit facilities with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fannie mae are predominately floating rate facilities the company also has a 100 million credit facility with freddie mac which is a variable rate facility these facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates the company was exposed to at december 31 2004 large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

because the company has substantial real estate holdings the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its communities is a significant component of expense real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the company if the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise the company’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and the company’s ability to pay its dividend could be affected 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis 

of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software all of which are judgmental determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets “statement 144” and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “statement 142” the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

in accordance with statement 144 longlived assets such as real estate assets and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps first the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket second if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement no 141 business combinations  the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps and caps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with the company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate 

risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 133 as amended requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective while the company’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 

the company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity 

overview of the year ended december 31 2004

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” represents net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or “gaap” excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gain on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 

in response to the securities and exchange commission’s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock the company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its ffo calculation 

the company’s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding the company’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 dollars and shares in thousands 

 ffo increased during 2004 by approximately 14658000 to 70025000 versus 55367000 in 2003 principally because of the addition of properties through the bremaac buyout and 2003 and 2004 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above ffo for 2002 was 53353000 ffo for 2003 and 2002 included charges of 5987000 and 2041000 respectively for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock 

trends 

property performance over the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company’s markets the economic downturn and the related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with and in some cases above historical averages 

the recent economic environment has impacted demand in two main ways 1 producing lower job growth which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the company’s markets and 2 producing lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing prompting more renters to purchase homes 

on the supply side the declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the company’s markets especially in the larger metropolitan markets delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a number of the company’s markets 

as part of its strategy to create continued stable and growing performance the company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets midsized markets and smaller tier markets as defined by population levels during the economic downturn the company’s smallertier and midsized markets produced more stable performance while its larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances 

the company is beginning to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment as and if the economic environment improves the company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates which the company believes will combine to increase the number of apartment renters and decrease the construction of new apartment units 

while increasing interest rates will increase the company’s cost of borrowing the company expects that this increase in demand will also generate stronger property performance across the company’s portfolio the company’s largetier markets which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn should begin to absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels while the company’s smallertier and midsized markets will also benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth 

over the long term general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners as immigration growth combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the “echo boomers” children of the “baby boomers” is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years the company believes its portfolio location throughout the southeast and south central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic trends

at december 31 2004 the taxfree bond facility and the fnma facility together the “fnma facilities” had a combined credit line limit of 950 million 839 million of which was available to borrow the fnma facilities have multiple maturity traunches that range from 2010 through 2014 the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security “dmbs” rate on the date of renewal which has typically approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 004 over the life of the fnma facilities plus a credit enhancement fee of 062 

each of the company’s credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity moreover if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company

substantially all of the resident leases at the communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation

investment focus  the company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the southeastern united states and texas between 1994 and 1997 the company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities between 1998 and 2000 its concentration was on development of new communities 

the company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and its operating management skills the company is also interested in increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster growing markets within its current market area to balance its portfolio between small middle and largetier markets and intends to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth and return through investments in joint ventures and in direct purchases the company will continue its established process of selling mature assets and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets 

high quality assets  the company maintains its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment it believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability the company periodically sells assets selectively in order to ensure that its portfolio consists only of high quality welllocated assets within its market area

decentralized operational structure  the company operates in a decentralized manner management believes that its decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition redevelopment and development processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property operations through extensive asset management programs and frequent onsite visitations the company is currently in the process of installing a new webbased property management system which increases the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties and does so on a real time basis improving the support provided to the operating environment

competition 

all of the company’s communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the company and the managers of these communities may have more experience than the company’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition the company makes capital improvements to both the communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

as part of the acquisition process the company generally obtains environmental studies on all of its communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these studies generally include historical reviews of the communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these studies more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these studies must be satisfactorily completed before the company takes ownership of an acquisition property however no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

the company is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold the company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease the company has also purchased a 2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the current policy expires in 2007 but is renewable at that time the company therefore believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

the environmental studies received by the company have not revealed any material environmental liabilities the company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

the company believes that its communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses planned asset dispositions disposition pricing and planned acquisition and developments although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 

the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company’s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control 

the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends andor to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing funds from operations and the value of the company’s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company’s control such events or conditions could include 

 15 

 currently the company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate any decline in the company’s funds from operations or property values because of these factors which are beyond its control could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to its shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results 

at december 31 2003 the company had total debt outstanding of 9519 million payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit the company currently intends to limit its total debt to around 60 of the undepreciated book value of its assets although the company’s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time as of december 31 2003 the company’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 54 the company’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders in addition the company must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company’s financial condition andor its funds from operations 

variable interest rates may adversely affect our funds from operations 

at december 31 2003 effectively 2166 million of the company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was unhedged and uncapped in addition the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variablerate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect the company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders the company’s 611 million secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fannie mae is predominately a floating rate facility the interest rates on which have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

increasing insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

because the company has substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring its communities is a significant component of expense premiums for property and casualty insurance have risen significantly in recent years if the cost of property and casualty insurance continues to rise its cost of doing business 

would likely rise which may in turn negatively impact the company’s financial condition and its ability to pay its dividend 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 

the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings to 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment and 3 years for computers all of which are judgmental determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets statement 144 and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 142 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

to evaluate goodwill and longlived assets for impairment the company estimates future operating cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset’s fair value in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair values is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in the community’s market or submarket 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with the company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under sfas no 133 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective the company performs effectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the term of the hedging instruments any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the fair value of the hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 

while the company’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been highly related 

overview of the year ended december 31 2003 

the company’s operating results for 2003 were impacted by continued economic weakness the company believes that the primary factor impacting demand for its apartments is job formation which was slightly negative or static in most of the company’s markets during 2003 this reduced the occupancy of its apartments affected its ability to grow rents and increased the amount of concessions that it had to offer to attract residents advertising and marketing expenditures also had to be increased to attract new residents the company regards single family housing as the primary competition for its existing residents and low interest rates that existed throughout the year allowed its residents to purchase homes and impacted the company’s occupancy rates the company began to see some improvement in the fourth quarter and expects operations to improve as the economy improves 

offsetting the impact to operations the company was able to continue its debt refinancing strategy and take advantage of the low interest rate environment by reducing the interest rates on its variable rate debt as a result the company was able to lower its average interest rate and experienced interest expense savings the company was also able to lower the dividend payments on its preferred stock by redeeming the preferred series a b  c and issuing a new series of preferred stock series h at a lower yield 

the company achieved external growth during 2003 by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and midsized growing markets in the southeastern united states and in texas the company made acquisitions both directly and through a joint venture partnership with crow holdings the company also purchased the 23 share of its joint venture owned by blackstone real estate advisors that was formed in 1999 the company funded part of these purchases through some selective direct sales of shares of common stock 

the financings and acquisitions made during 2003 helped the company continue its strategy of improving the flexibility of its balance sheet and enhancing its ability to strengthen its dividend coverage 

the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2003 the total number of apartment units the company owned or had an ownership interest in including the properties owned by the company’s joint ventures was 35734 in 127 communities compared to the 33923 apartment units in 123 communities owned at december 31 2002 and the 33411 apartment units in 122 communities owned at december 31 2001 for properties owned 100 by the company the average monthly rental per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to 667 at december 31 2003 from 661 at december 31 2002 and 660 at december 31 2001 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 was 927 919 and 927 respectively

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” represents net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or “gaap” excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations and insurance settlement proceeds plus depreciation and amortization of real estate and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” recommended definition 

the company’s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are 

capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets whose value does not diminish predictably over time as historical cost depreciation implies the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the three years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 dollars and shares in thousands 

 net income increased during 2003 by approximately 4065000 to 20206000 versus 16141000 in 2002 principally because of reduced interest expenses a 1919000 gain on the sale of the crossings apartments which is classified as a discontinued operation and 2942000 net gain on insurance settlement proceeds which were only partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization from acquisitions net income for 2001 was 28698000 which included a gain of 11933000 from dispositions of assets and insurance settlement proceeds 

ffo increased during 2003 by approximately 2014000 to 55367000 versus 53353000 in 2002 principally because of reduced interest expense ffo for 2001 was 56023000 ffo for 2003 and 2002 included charges of 5987000 and 2041000 respectively for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock 

trends 

property performance over the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company’s markets the recent economic downturn and the related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with historical averages 

the recent economic environment has impacted demand in two main ways 1 producing lower job growth which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the company’s markets and 2 producing lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing prompting more renters to purchase homes 

on the supply side the declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the company’s markets especially in the larger metropolitan markets delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a number of the company’s markets 

as part of its strategy to create continued stable and growing performance the company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets midsized markets and smaller tier markets as defined by population levels during the recent economic downturn the company’s smaller tier and midsized markets produced more stable performance while it’s larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances 

the company is beginning to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment as the economic environment improves the company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates which should combine to increase the number of apartment renters 

the company expects that this increase in demand will generate stronger property performance across the company’s portfolio the company’s largetier markets which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn should begin to absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels while the company’s smallertier and midsized markets would benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth 

over the long term general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners as immigration growth combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the “echo boomers” children of the “baby boomers” is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years the company believes its portfolio location throughout the southeast and south central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic trends

the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund both its current operations annual refurbishment of its properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma which provides credit enhancement for nearly 611 million of 

the company’s outstanding debt the market for fnma dmbs which in the company’s experience is highly effective with threemonth libor interest rates is also an important component of the company’s liquidity and swap effectiveness in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient or the credit of fnma becomes impaired the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 

the company believes that cash provided by operations is adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate in both the short and longterm to meet operating requirements including recurring capital expenditures at the communities and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements under the internal revenue code the company has loan covenants that limit the total amount of distributions but believes that it is unlikely that these will be a limiting factor on the company’s future levels of distributions based on the company’s current range of forecast of operating performance the company expects to meet its liquidity requirements such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions expansions and nonrecurring capital expenditures through collateralized borrowings potential joint venture transactions and the company’s credit facilities 

currently the company’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings any significant deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate

insurance 

the company put in place a new property and casualty insurance program effective july 1 2003 the program is substantially the same as last year in the opinion of management property and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity financial position or results of operations 

inflation 

substantially all of the resident leases at the communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable there under and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases almost all leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation

operating philosophy 

investment focus  the company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the southeastern united states and texas between 1994 and 1997 the company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing apartments between 1998 and 2000 its concentration was on development of new apartments in 1999 the company established a joint venture and sold assets to that joint venture between august 1999 and december 2001 the company repurchased approximately 186 million shares of its common stock funded in part by asset sales in 2002 the company established a second joint venture to acquire new properties the company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital and its operating management skills the company is also interested in increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster growing markets within its current market area and intends to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average growth and return through investments in joint ventures and in direct purchases the company will continue its established process of selling mature assets and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets 

high quality assets  the company maintains its assets in excellent condition believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher longrun returns on investment it believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties landscaping and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability the company sells assets selectively in order to ensure that its portfolio consists only of high quality welllocated assets within its market area 

diversified market focus  the company focuses on owning operating developing constructing and acquiring apartment communities the “communities” throughout the southeastern united states and texas in large medium and small markets 

intensive management focus  the company strongly emphasizes onsite property management particular attention is paid to opportunities to increase rents raise average occupancy rates and control costs property managers and regional managers are given the responsibility for monitoring market trends and the discretion to react to such trends the company as part of its intense management focus has established a number of training programs to produce highly competent property managers leasing consultants and service technicians who work onsite at the communities to generate the highest possible income from the company’s assets 

decentralized operational structure  the company operates in a decentralized manner management believes that its decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition redevelopment and development processes to support this decentralized operational structure senior and executive management are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property operations through extensive asset management programs and direct onsite visitations 

proactive balance sheet and portfolio management 

the company focuses on maximizing the return on assets and adding to the intrinsic underlying value of each share of the company’s common stock routinely reviewing each asset based on its determined value and selling those which no longer fit its investment criteria the company constantly evaluates the effectiveness of its capital allocations and makes adjustments to its strategy including investing in acquisitions and development debt retirement and repurchases of shares of the company’s common stock 

strategies 

the company seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth 

operating growth strategy  management’s goal is to maximize the company’s return on investment in each community by increasing rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels the company seeks higher net rental revenues by enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the communities and managing expenses through its system of detailed management reporting and accountability in order to achieve increases in operating cash flow the steps taken to meet these objectives include 

•   empowering the company’s property managers to adjust rents in response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident turnover during peak rental demand months 

•   offering new services to residents including telephone cable and internet access on which the company generates fee and commission income 

•   implementing programs to control expenses through investment in costsaving initiatives such as the installation of individual apartment unit water and utility meters in certain communities 

•   analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas 

•   improving the “curb appeal” of the communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning communities from time to time to maintain market leadership positions 

•   compensating employees through performancebased compensation and stock ownership programs 

•   maintaining a handson management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior management’s continued close contact with the market and employees 

•   selling or exchanging underperforming assets and repurchasing shares of common stock when cost of capital and asset values permit and 

•   allocating additional capital where the investment will generate the highest returns for the company 

joint venture strategy  one of the company’s strategies is to coinvest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities which enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management fees which leverages the company’s recognized skills in acquiring repositioning redeveloping and managing multifamily investments the company is actively seeking attractively priced opportunities in which it and its joint venture partners can invest the company established a joint venture in 1999 with blackstone and a second joint venture in 2002 with crow holdings 

disposition strategy  the company is committed to the selective disposition of mature assets defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet the company’s investment criteria and longterm strategic objectives typically the company selects assets for disposition that do not meet its present investment criteria including future return on investment location market potential for growth and capital needs 

acquisition strategy  one of the company’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its investment criteria and focus as discussed above the company has extensive experience and researchbased skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily properties the company will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise and will utilize this strategy to increase the share of its assets in faster growing and larger markets in the southeast and texas 

on july 2 2002 the company purchased the preston hills at mill creek apartments a 464unit apartment community in buford ga for 337 million the community was bought with the expectation that it would be subsequently transferred to chrealty on november 20 2002 at the company’s cost preston hills at mill creek was transferred into chrealty 

development strategy  in late 1997 the company’s emphasis shifted from acquisitions to development because of its belief that under thencurrent market conditions such development would generate higher quality assets and higher longterm investment returns in 2002 the company completed a fouryear 300 million construction program of high quality apartments in several markets this represents the completion of the development program initiated in 1997 in 1999 management decided to exit the construction and development business upon completion of the company’s existing development pipeline after determining that market conditions were changing making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the company’s profitability targets over the next few years 

at december 31 2002 the company had two completed development properties with 921 apartment units in various stages of leaseup and no properties in development the company periodically evaluates opportunities for profitable future development investments 

share repurchase program 

in 1999 the company’s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of the company’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares as of december 31 2002 the company had repurchased a total of approximately 186 million shares 8 of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program from time to time the company intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy outlined in this annual report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is enhanced factors affecting this determination include the share price asset dispositions and pricing financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments no shares were repurchased during 2002 

competition 

all of the company’s communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area the owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the company and the managers of these communities may have more experience than the company’s management moreover singlefamily rental housing manufactured housing condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities 

apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent discounts and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities and apartment community amenities including recreational facilities resident services and physical property condition the company makes capital improvements to both the communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market 

environmental matters 

as part of the acquisition process the company generally obtains environmental audits on all of its communities from various outside environmental engineering firms the purpose of these audits is to identify potential sources of contamination at the communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance these audits generally include historical reviews of the communities reviews of certain public records preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties visual inspection for the presence of asbestos pcbs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports depending on the results of these audits more invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination these audits must be satisfactorily completed before the company takes ownership of an acquisition property however no assurance can be given that the audits identify all significant environmental problems 

under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease furthermore the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to promptly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 

the company is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold the company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease the company has also purchased a 2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold the company therefore believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and controlled 

the environmental audit reports received by the company have not revealed any material environmental liability the company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability nevertheless it is possible that the audit reports do not reveal all environmental 

liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware moreover no assurance can be given concerning future laws ordinances or regulations or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents 

the company believes that its communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby these statements include but are not limited to statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses anticipated leaseup and rental concessions at development properties planned asset dispositions disposition pricing and planned acquisition and developments although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included in this report on form 10k will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 

the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material or adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company’s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control 

the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash in order to make distributions to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements funds from operations and the value of the company’s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company’s control such events or conditions could include 

•   competition from other apartment communities 

•   overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in the company’s markets which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates andor require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units 

•   increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset by increased rents 

•   the company’s inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms 

•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance 

•   changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing 

•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates drop and home loans are available more readily or increase the company’s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available 

•   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing 

•   decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the company’s joint ventures and 

•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 

currently the company’s funds available for distribution are insufficient to fully finance the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings any significant further deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate any decline in the 

company’s funds from operations or property values because of these factors which are beyond its control could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to its shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results 

at december 31 2003 the company had total debt outstanding of 8037 million payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit the company intends to keep its total debt below 60 of the undepreciated book value of its assets although the company’s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time as of december 31 2002 the company’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 53 the company’s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders in addition the company must repay its debt upon maturity and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company’s financial condition andor its funds from operations 

variable interest rates may adversely affect our funds from operations 

at december 31 2002 approximately 2988 million of the company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate in addition the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates variablerate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase which would adversely affect the company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders the company’s 550 million credit facility with fannie mae is predominately a floating rate facility the interest rates on which have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps upon the termination of these swaps and caps the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 

increasing insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition 

because the company has substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring its properties is a significant item of expense due to the events of september 11 2001 and other recent disasters premiums for property and casualty insurance have risen significantly in recent months if the cost of property and casualty insurance continues to rise its cost of doing business would likely rise which may in turn negatively impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 

the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations in that they require the most subjective judgments form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets impairment of longlived assets including goodwill and fair value of derivative financial instruments 

capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets 

the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings to 5 years for furniture fixtures and equipment all of which are judgmental determinations repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements renovations and 

replacements are capitalized the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company’s standards are capitalized as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

the company accounts for longlived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets statement 144 and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 142 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance market conditions and legal factors 

to evaluate goodwill and the recovery value of longlived assets the company estimates future operating cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset’s fair value in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair values is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in the community’s market or submarket 

fair value of derivative financial instruments 

the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments during the normal course of business to manage or hedge the interest rate risk associated with the company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage welldefined interest rate risk associated with the transaction the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under sfas no 133 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective the company performs effectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter through the maturity of the hedge any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings the fair value of the hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 

while the company’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations the historical correlation of the rates of the hedge and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedge and have been highly related 

overview 

the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2002 the total number of apartment units the company owned or had an ownership interest in including the 11 properties containing 3257 apartment units owned by the company’s joint ventures was 33923 in 123 communities compared to the 33411 apartment units in 122 communities owned at december 31 2001 and the 33612 apartment units in 124 communities owned at december 31 2000 for properties owned 100 by the company the average monthly rental per apartment unit excluding units in leaseup increased to 661 at december 31 2002 from 660 at december 31 2001 and 642 at december 31 2000 for these same units overall occupancy at december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 919 927 and 942 respectively 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” represents net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or “gaap” excluding extraordinary items minority interest in operating partnership income gain or loss on disposition of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate and adjustments for the joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis this 

definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” recommended definition 

the company’s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting vinyl flooring and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties during the stabilization period for acquisition properties these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties and thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company’s results of operations in that such calculation reflects the company’s ability to support interest payments and general operating expenses before the impact of certain activities such as changes in other assets and accounts payable the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits the company views the amount paid to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values as experienced in 2002 in relation to the retirement of its series e preferred stock as comparable to an extraordinary item for ffo purposes 

ffo decreased during 2002 by approximately 374000 to 56838000 versus 57212000 in 2001 and 57456000 in 2000 principally because of reduced occupancy and increased concessions at properties owned for more than a year 

net income decreased during 2002 by approximately 12557000 to 16141000 versus 28698000 in 2001 and 29787000 in 2000 principally because 2001 and 2000 experienced net gains of 11933000 and 11587000 respectively related to dispositions of assets in 2002 the company did not sell any assets in 2001 and 2000 the company sold a total of 2474 units under its disposition strategy discussed earlier in this annual report and reallocated the majority of the proceeds from those sales to the reduction of debt the share repurchase program and the completion of development properties 

the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the three years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 dollars and shares in thousands

trends 

property revenues during the year ended december 31 2002 were impacted by general economic weakness and excess supply of apartments which was evident throughout the majority of the company’s portfolio the decrease in new household formations and single family home purchases due to historically low interest rates have affected demand in many of the company’s markets which has created extremely competitive leasing environments these dynamics are expected to continue for the next several quarters current occupancy rates rent growth and concession levels are not at historical levels and are not expected to improve until the national economy improves

the increase in corporatecommercial capital improvements for 2002 over 2001 is mainly related to the fire at the company’s corporate headquarters in march of 2002 for which the company expects to be reimbursed with insurance proceeds 

net cash used in financing activities decreased from approximately 71301000 for 2001 to approximately 48492000 during 2002 during 2002 the company increased its borrowings under its credit lines by 60623000 as compared to a decrease of 12432000 in 2001 mainly related to refinancings of individual mortgages and the purchase of the preston hills apartments during 2001 the company used 3280000 to repurchase shares of its common stock no shares were repurchased during 2002 

in august 2002 the company negotiated an increase from 309 million to 550 million in the borrowing capacity of its existing secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital credit enhanced by fannie mae the “fnma facility” the expanded capacity may be utilized only as additional collateral is pledged to secure the facility at december 31 2002 the fnma facility had an outstanding balance of 3468 million on an available borrowing base of 3518 million 313 million of the fnma facility expires in 2004 renewable for two successive 5year terms while the remaining 237 million expires in 2007 renewable for a 5year term the company plans to utilize the additional facility capacity to refinance debt maturities over the next 18 months 

the fnma facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings the interest rate on the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security “dmbs” rate on the date of renewal which has typically approximated threemonth libor less an average spread of 009 plus a credit enhancement fee of 067 based on the outstanding borrowings the variable interest rate at december 31 2002 was 21 on variable rate borrowings of 2368 million fixed rate borrowings under the fnma facility totaled 110 million at december 31 2002 at interest rates inclusive of creditenhancement fees from 577 to 771 and maturities from 2006 to 2009 

compass bank provides an unsecured credit facility to the company outstanding borrowings under this facility at december 31 2002 were 10 million 

the company currently maintains a 70 million secured credit facility with a group of banks led by amsouth bank there was 503000 outstanding under this facility at december 31 2002 available borrowing base capacity under this facility was 331 million at december 31 2002 

each of the company’s credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity moreover if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding andor foreclose on properties securing such facilities any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk the company has five interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of 125 million which have variable legs based on one or threemonth libor and fixed legs with an average rate of 69 the swaps have expirations between 2003 and 2007 and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the company’s designated variable rate borrowings of its fnma facility the company has designed these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on its fnma facility through the use of these swaps the company believes it has effectively fixed the borrowing rate during these periods of 125 million of variable rate borrowings issued through the fnma facility leaving only 111839000 of the fnma facility of which the interest rate has not been fixed or hedged additionally the company has a 46690000 taxfree bond facility with fnma the company has three interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 34790000 which have variable legs based on the bma municipal swap index and fixed legs with an average rate of 42 these swaps expire in 2007 and 2008 and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the designated borrowings of the taxfree bond facility the company also entered into a cap agreement on a notional amount of 68 million within the taxfree bond facility the 5year cap agreement has a strike rate of 6 as indexed on the bma municipal swap index 

the company has also executed five forward interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of 175 million all of which go into effect in 2003 the variable legs of these forward interest rate swaps are based on threemonth libor and the fixed legs have an average rate of 52 the swaps have lives from two to seven years and are designated as cash flow hedges on future planned refinancings 

in 2003 the company had approximating 151 million of debt maturing including the 142 million of bond indebtedness of midamerica capital partners lp which it funded by debt issued under the fnma facility the rate on the maturing debt is 65 and the rate on the replacement debt which has been preset through forward interest rate swaps is 56 

the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity at december 31 2002 for the 8037 million of debt outstanding were 58 and 109 years compared to 63 and 100 years on 77966 million of debt outstanding at december 31 2001 

on october 16 2002 the company closed the sale of 474500 shares of a new 9¼ series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series f preferred stock” at 25 per share for an aggregate principal amount of 1175 million 

on october 28 2002 the company privately placed 400000 shares of a new 8 5  8  series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series g preferred stock” at 25 per share for an aggregate principal amount of 10 million 

the net proceeds from the issuances of the series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock along with 5 million of debt were used to repurchase and retire all of the 1000000 shares of the company’s series e cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a 7 premium totaling 20 million including the writeoff of previous issuance costs for an aggregate purchase price of 2675 million 

the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund both its current operations annual refurbishment of its properties and incremental investment in new apartment properties the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma which provides credit enhancement for nearly 400 million of the company’s debt the market for fnma dmbs which in the company’s experience is highly effective with threemonth libor interest rates is also an important component of the company’s liquidity and swap effectiveness in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient or the credit of fnma becomes impaired the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 

the company believes that cash provided by operations is adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate in both the short and longterm to meet operating requirements including recurring capital expenditures at the communities and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements under the internal revenue code the company has loan covenants that limit the total amount of distributions but believes that it is unlikely that these will be a limiting factor on the company’s future levels of distributions based on the company’s current range of forecast of operating performance the company expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions preferred stock redemptions expansions and nonrecurring capital expenditures through long and medium term collateralized fixed rate borrowings potential joint venture transactions and the company’s credit facilities 

currently the company’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fully finance the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings any significant further deterioration in operations could result in the company’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate 

the following table reflects the company’s total contractual cash obligations which consists of its longterm debt as of december 31 2002 dollars in 000’s 

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes the company’s joint venture with blackstone was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in revenues from the sale the company’s joint venture with crow holdings was established to acquire approximately 150 million of multifamily properties in addition the company does not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts as such the company is not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships the company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their nonindependent relationships with the company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements note 10

insurance 

the company put in place a new insurance program effective july 1 2002 the program is substantially the same as last year but includes greater retention levels for liability and workers’ compensation insurance the company was later able to have the foreign terrorism exclusion lifted and retains the first 15 million of loss in the opinion of management property and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the company’s liquidity financial position or results of operations 

inflation 

substantially all of the resident leases at the communities allow at the time of renewal for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less the shortterm nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation
