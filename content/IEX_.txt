 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of the company’s operations and the financial results of its operations elsewhere in this report the most material of these factors are included below current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks these risks are not the only risks that may affect the company additional risks that the company is not aware of or does not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect the company’s business 

risks related to the company’s operations 

the company and its results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to be a rapidlychanging situation that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy the extent to which covid19 and the emergence of variant strains continues to impact the company will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence such as the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for the company its suppliers and its customers any changes in or resurgence of covid19 could have a material impact on the company’s ability to get the raw materials parts and components it needs to manufacture its products as its suppliers face disruptions in their businesses closures or bankruptcy as a result of covid19 the company depends greatly on its suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of its products if its suppliers fail to meet its manufacturing needs in the future it would delay the company’s production and product shipments to customers and negatively affect operations 

the company has implemented workfromhome policies for certain “nonessential” employees although these workfromhome policies have not negatively impacted the company in any material respect to date covid19 is dynamic and any future resurgences could negatively impact productivity disrupt conduct of the company’s business in the ordinary course and delay production timelines due to the large remote workforce populations the company may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that it relies on for certain information technologies to administer store and support the company’s multiple business activities idex is heavily dependent on the availability and support of its technology landscape several of which are provided by external third party service providers eg microsoft att and verizon although the company has not suffered any disruptions to date any future disruptions in their operations could also negatively impact the company and its operating results and financial condition 

to the extent covid19 adversely affects the company and its financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report such as those relating to international operations the company’s ability to develop new products the company’s ability to execute on its growth strategy of acquisitions the company’s dependency on raw materials parts and components the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the company the effects on the company that result from declines in commodity prices and the company’s reliance on labor availability to operate and grow the business 

the company’s inability to continue to develop new products could limit sales growth 

the company’s ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to its ability to continue to develop new products a failure to continue to develop and deliver new innovative and competitive products to the market could limit sales growth and negatively impact the company and its financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the company’s growth strategy includes acquisitions and the company may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

the company’s historical growth has included and the company’s future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions the company intends to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance its position in existing markets throughout the world the company may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to the company 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets served by the company are highly competitive and this competition could reduce sales and operating margins 

most of the company’s products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving a competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and distribution networks the company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position the company’s competitors may develop products that are superior may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt quicker to new technologies or evolving customer requirements the company may not be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or with new competitors pricing pressures may require the company to adjust the prices of products to stay competitive failure to continue competing successfully could reduce sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

the company is dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in its products

critical accounting estimates 

the company believes that the application of the following accounting policy which is important to its financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of the company’s accounting policies including the accounting policy discussed below see note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

goodwill and intangible assets  — the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes the company follows the guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification “asc” 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach to determine the fair value of its indefinitelived intangible assets the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations based on the results of the company’s annual impairment test at october 31 2021 all reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine the fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the following assumption ranges were utilized by the company in 2021 and 2020

nongaap disclosures 

set forth below are reconciliations of each of organic sales adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to idex adjusted diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to idex earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda to its respective most directly comparable us gaap measure management uses these metrics to measure performance of the company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations such as fair value inventory stepup charges restructuring expenses and asset impairments the impact of the settlement for a corporate transaction indemnity losses on early debt redemptions and the loss related to the termination of the us pension plan net of curtailment management also supplements its us gaap financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making the reconciliation of segment ebitda and adjusted segment ebitda to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that the company does not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to its segments 

this report references organic sales and organic operating income nongaap measures that exclude 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales and operating income respectively from acquired or divested businesses during the first 12 months of ownership or prior to divestiture the portion of sales and operating income attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and organic operating income respectively and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and organic operating income respectively after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales and organic operating income provides useful information to investors by helping to identify underlying growth trends in the company’s business and facilitating easier comparisons of the company’s revenue and operating performance with prior and future periods and to its peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales and organic operating income because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult due to the varying nature size and number of transactions from period to period and between the company and its peers 

given the acquisitive nature of the company which results in a higher level of amortization expense from recently acquired businesses management uses ebitda as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses’ performance across the company’s three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes management believes that ebitda is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the company and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the company’s industry management believes that ebitda margin is useful for the same reason as ebitda ebitda is also used to calculate certain financial covenants as discussed in note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” such as ebitda interest coverage which is ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense in addition this report presents adjusted ebitda which is ebitda adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations as discussed above and adjusted ebitda interest coverage which is adjusted ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense management believes that adjusted ebitda is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations the company believes that adjusted ebitda is also useful to some investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the company and its segments’ ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the company’s industry the definition of adjusted ebitda used here may differ from that used by other companies 

this report also references free cash flow this nongaap measure is discussed and reconciled to its most directly comparable gaap measure in the section above titled “cash flow summary” 

the nongaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with us gaap the financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated 













1 ebitda a nongaap financial measure is reconciled to net income its most directly comparable us gaap financial measure immediately above in table 5

at least once per year the board of directors reviews employee diversity performance through its chroled senior talent review additionally the company tracks diversity performance of the top 400 leaders and provides regular updates to the board on how leadership demographics are changing over time the board has also recently pledged to include a dei topic on the agenda of every regularly scheduled board meeting moving forward in 2020 we increased representation for both women and people of color in our leadership ranks since 2018 we have increased the number of senior leaders globally who are women by more than 27 and leaders in the us who are racially or ethnically diverse of color by 23 

further the company has been conducting pay equity analysis for us employees since 2018 to ensure that employees’ actual pay was substantially similar to their predicted pay where appropriate we provided base pay adjustments for employees that were outliers from their predicted pay further reinforcing the company’s commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion equality and respect

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most material of these factors are included below current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks these risks are not the only risks that may affect us additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect our business 

risks related to our operations 

our business results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has been a rapidlychanging situation that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy our operating results are subject to fluctuations based on general economic conditions and have been adversely affected by the negative general economic conditions the extent to which covid19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence such as the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for our company our suppliers and our customers 

the deterioration in economic conditions materially reduced and could continue to reduce the company’s sales and profitability although we began to see improvement in our end markets beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020 the financial distress our customers have experienced due to the deterioration in economic conditions has resulted in and could continue to result in reduced sales which has and could continue to negatively impact our results of operations any changes in or resurgence of the covid19 outbreak could also have a material impact on our ability to get the raw materials parts and components we need to manufacture our products as our suppliers face disruptions in their businesses closures or bankruptcy as a result of the covid19 outbreak we depend greatly on our suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of our products although we have not experienced material supply chain disruptions to date if our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs in the future it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations 

us and international government responses to the covid19 outbreak have included “shelter in place” “stay at home” and similar types of orders these orders exempt certain individuals needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors as determined by the us federal and international governmental bodies although the company’s operations are currently considered essential and exempt if any of the applicable exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future including in response to any covid19 resurgence that would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition furthermore to the extent these exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers this would also adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition we have also implemented workfromhome policies for certain “nonessential” employees although these workfromhome policies have not negatively impacted our business in any material respect to date the covid19 outbreak is dynamic and any future resurgences could negatively impact productivity disrupt conduct of our business in the ordinary course and delay our production timelines 

due to the large remote workforce populations we may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that we rely on for certain information technologies to administer store and support the company’s multiple business activities idex is heavily dependent on the availability and support of our technology landscape several of which are provided by external third party service providers eg microsoft att and verizon although we have not suffered any disruptions to date any future disruptions in their operations could also negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

to the extent the covid19 outbreak continues to adversely affect our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report such as those relating to our international operations our ability to develop new products our ability to execute on our growth strategy of acquisitions our dependency on raw materials parts and components the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our company the effects on our company that result from declines in commodity prices and our reliance on labor availability to operate and grow our business 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products a failure to continue to develop and deliver new innovative and competitive products to the market could limit our sales growth and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers including due to geopolitical or civil unrest unfavorable economic or industry conditions labor disruptions catastrophic weather events natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion 

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems or the systems of our customers or thirdparty hosting services are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further given the unpredictability nature and scope of cybersecurity attacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period 

risks related to economic conditions 

changes in us or international economic conditions could materially adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2020 49 of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 51 were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include industrial semiconductor automotive life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil and gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

changes to geopolitical and economic conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2020 approximately 51 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

• possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations 

• risks of economic instability 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation 

• potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies 

• disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances 

• withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the united states and other countries 

• risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws 

• effects of the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union and related potential disruption to trade including the effects of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed on december 30 2020 

• changes in tariff and trade barriers including uncertainty caused by the evolving relations between the united states and china and 

• geopolitical events including natural disasters public health issues political instability terrorism insurrection or war 

any of these events could have a materially adverse impact on our business and operations 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound indian rupee chinese renminbi and swedish krona any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates we maintain a revolving credit facility which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted libor plus in each case an applicable margin based on the lower of the companys senior unsecured longterm debt rating or the company’s applicable leverage ratio a significant increase in libor would significantly increase our cost of borrowings further any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the expected transition away from libor may result in the usage of higher interest rates under our revolving credit facility and our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affectedwe are also exposed to risks if the us federal reserve raises its benchmark interest rate which may reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal accounting and regulatory matters 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we are currently involved in pending and threatened legal regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes and may also involve governmental inquiries inspections audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters intellectual property environmental health and safety issues governmental regulations employment and other matters where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 11 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets or goodwill would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2020 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 18956 million and 4156 million respectively these assets primarily result from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 6 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

challenges with respect to labor availability could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

  

our success depends in part on the ability of our businesses to proactively attract motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market a failure to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business additionally any labor stoppages or labor disruptions including due to geopolitical unrest unfavorable economic or industry conditions catastrophic weather events natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business

the company is contributing in efforts to end the covid19 pandemic with several of our businesses pivoting to support many products that are being used in the fight against covid19 safety is our top priority and we have implemented protocols at all of our facilities including temperature taking social distancing enhanced cleaning and face coverings these measures have enabled successful business continuity allowing our facilities to remain in operation with only temporary shutdowns at the initial onset of the covid19 pandemic although we have remained in operation throughout the pandemic satisfying customer needs in part through our focus on the development and manufacturing of products used in the fight against covid19 the pandemic and the enacted containment measures have adversely affected our business and results of operations from the onset of the pandemic through the second quarter of 2020 our customers purchased less product than they have historically purchased however beginning in the third quarter and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020 we began to see improvement in our end markets and we expect our end markets to continue to normalize to historical levels through 2021 additionally idex has implemented cost reduction actions including employee reductions and facility consolidations and continues to maintain a tight cost control environment moreover covid19 and related measures to contain its impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial markets and economies the continuing impact of covid19 and the enacted containment measures cannot be predicted and may continue to adversely affect perhaps materially our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to us gaap but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first 12 months of ownership or prior to divestiture the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult due to the varying nature size and number of transactions from period to period and between the company and its peers

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset which is in line with shipping terms certain units recognize revenue over time because control transfers continuously to our customers revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation ie the costtocost method or is recognized ratably over the contract term as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our estimates regularly due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catchup adjustment the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties primarily assurancetype and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying value is not recoverable through future operations an impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived or indefinitelived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value additionally testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinitelived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine the fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2020 and 2019 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considers both the market approach and the income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2021 ebitda 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements longterm growth rates and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

the banjo trade name and the akron brass trade name are indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach to determine the fair value of these trade names the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

defined benefit retirement plans — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined after consulting with actuaries on a number of key assumptions and on information provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions idex adopts these annual updates and in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 28 million based upon the december 31 2020 data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 34 million based upon the december 31 2020 data

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are included below current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks these risks are not the only risks that may affect us additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect our business 

changes in us or international economic conditions could materially adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2019  50 of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 50 were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include industrial semiconductor automotive life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil and gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

change to geopolitical and economic conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2019  approximately 50 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

 

any of these events could have a materially adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products a failure to continue to develop and deliver new innovative and competitive products to the market could limit our sales growth and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s 

attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers including due to geopolitical unrest unfavorable economic or industry conditions labor disruptions catastrophic weather events natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound indian rupee chinese renminbi and swedish krona any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates we maintain a revolving credit facility which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted libor plus in each case an applicable margin based on the companys senior unsecured longterm debt rating or the company’s applicable leverage ratio a significant increase in libor would significantly increase our cost of borrowings we are also exposed to risks if the us federal reserve raises its benchmark interest rate which may reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we are currently involved in pending and threatened legal regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes and may also involve governmental inquiries inspections audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters intellectual property environmental health and safety issues governmental regulations employment and other matters where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets or goodwill would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2019  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 17797 million and 3880 million  respectively these assets primarily result from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 5 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

challenges with respect to labor availability could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

  

our success depends in part on the ability of our businesses to proactively attract motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market a failure to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business additionally any labor stoppages or labor disruptions including due to geopolitical unrest unfavorable economic or industry conditions catastrophic weather events natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion

unpredictability nature and scope of cybersecurity attacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 for discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  which was filed with the sec on february 28 2019 for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to us gaap but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult due to the varying nature size and number of transactions from period to period and between the company and its peers 

performance in 2019 compared with 2018 



sales in 2019 were 25 billion  which was flat compared with last year this reflects a 1 increase in organic sales and a 1 increase from acquisitions velcora  july 2019 and fli  july 2018 offset by a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 50 of total sales in 2019 compared with 51 in 2018  

in 2019  fluid  metering technologies contributed 38 of sales and 44 of total segment operating income health  science technologies contributed 37 of sales and 31 of total segment operating income and fire  safetydiversified products contributed 25 of sales and 25 of total segment operating income 

gross profit of 11 billion in 2019 increased 71 million  or 1  from 2018  while gross margin increased 10 basis points to 451  in 2019 from 450 in 2018  the increase in gross profit and margin is primarily a due to price capture and productivity initiatives partially offset by a fair value inventory stepup charge inflation and higher engineering costs 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses decreased to 5250 million in 2019 from 5367 million in 2018  the 117 million decrease is primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses and tighter cost controls in 2019 as well as a stamp duty charge in switzerland in 2018 as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 212 for 2019 and 216 for 2018  

in 2019 and 2018  the company incurred pretax restructuring expenses totaling 210 million and 121 million  respectively to facilitate longterm sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions facility

other income expense  net changed by 57 million  from income of 40 million in 2018 to expense of 18 million in 2019 mainly due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2018 that did not repeat in 2019  

interest expense increased to 443 million in 2019 from 441 million in 2018  the increase was primarily due to interest on debt assumed in the velcora acquisition which has been subsequently retired 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes decreased to 1074 million in 2019 compared to 1184 million in 2018  the effective tax rate decreased to 202 in 2019 compared to 224 in 2018 due to an increase in the excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation a partial change in the assertion of permanent reinvestment of certain foreign tax earnings in 2018  and the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset which is in line with shipping terms certain units recognize revenue over time because control transfers continuously to our customers revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation ie the costtocost method or is recognized ratably over the contract term as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our estimates regularly due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs will be revised such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catchup adjustment the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties primarily assurancetype and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived or indefinitelived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount additionally testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinitelived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets in the second quarter of 2019  the company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the hst segment prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business the business was informed in the third quarter of 2019 of the loss of its largest customer as a result the company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time this event required an interim impairment test be performed on the longlived tangible assets of the business which resulted in an impairment charge of 97 million  consisting of 61 million related to a customer relationships intangible asset 10 million related to an unpatented technology intangible asset 20 million related to property plant and equipment and 06 million related to a building rightofuse asset in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company completed the consolidation of one of its facilities into the optics center of excellence in rochester new york which resulted in an impairment charge of 04 million related to a building rightofuse asset these charges were recorded as restructuring expense in the consolidated statements of operations in 2018  there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date and the company concluded that there were no longlived assets with a fair value that was less than the carrying value 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2019 and 2018 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considers both the market approach and the income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2020 ebitda 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements longterm growth rates and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

the banjo trade name and the akron brass trade name are indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach to determine the fair value of these trade names the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

defined benefit retirement plans — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined after consulting with actuaries on a number of key assumptions and on information provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions idex adopts these annual updates and in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2019  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 25 million based upon the december 31 2019 data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 31 million based upon the december 31 2019 data

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2018  49  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 51  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include industrial life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil and gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

change to political and economic conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2018  approximately 51  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

 

any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products a failure to continue to develop and deliver new innovative and competitive products to the market could limit our sales growth and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates we maintain a revolving credit facility which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus in each case an applicable margin based on the companys senior unsecured longterm debt rating a significant increase in libor would significantly increase our cost of borrowings we are also exposed to risks if the us federal reserve raises its benchmark interest rate which may reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we are currently involved in pending and threatened legal regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes and may also involve governmental inquiries inspections audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters intellectual property environmental health and safety issues governmental regulations employment and other matters where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 9 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets or goodwill would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2018  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 16980 million  and 3833 million  respectively these assets primarily result from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our 

goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 5 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

challenges with respect to labor availability could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

  

our success depends in part on the ability of our businesses to proactively attract motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market a failure to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion 

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems or the systems of our customers or thirdparty hosting services are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further given the unpredictability nature and scope of cybersecurity attacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts 

committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the changes included in the tax act were broad and complex the company finalized the impact of the reduction in the corporate rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax based upon the company’s interpretations of the tax act however additional guidance issued by the internal revenue service the us department of treasury or any other applicable taxing authority or actions taken by the company may result in a different impact 

in addition foreign jurisdictions may enact tax legislation that could significantly affect our ongoing operations aspects of us tax reform could also lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult due to the varying nature size and number of transactions from period to period and between the company and its peers 

performance in 2018  compared with 2017 



sales in 2018  were 25 billion  a 9   increase  from last year this increase  reflects an 8   increase  in organic sales and a 1  favorable impact from foreign currency translation sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 51  of total sales in 2018  compared with 49  in 2017  

in 2018  fluid  metering technologies contributed 38  of sales and 42  of total segment operating income health  science technologies contributed 36  of sales and 32  of total segment operating income and fire  safetydiversified products contributed 26  of sales and 26  of total segment operating income 

gross profit of 11 billion in 2018   increased   912 million  or 9  from 2017  while gross margin increased 10 basis points to 450  in 2018  from 449  in 2017  the increase in gross profit and margin is primarily a result of productivity initiatives and volume leverage partially offset by higher engineering costs 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased  to 5367 million  in 2018  from 5249 million  in 2017  the 118 million   increase  is mainly attributable to a stamp duty tax in switzerland associated with the restructuring of intercompany loans and higher stock compensation as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 216  for 2018  and 230  for 2017  

in 2017 the company divested its faure herman business for a pretax gain of 93 million 

in 2018  and 2017  the company incurred pretax restructuring expenses totaling 121 million  and 85 million  respectively as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate longterm sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization 

operating income of 5691 million  in 2018   increased  from 5026 million  in 2017  primarily due to volume leverage partially offset by the gain on the sale of a business in 2017 and higher restructuring costs in 2018 operating margin of 229  in 2018  was up   90  basis points from 220  in 2017  primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives partially offset by the gain on the sale of a business in 2017 and higher restructuring costs in 2018 

other income expense  net changed by 64 million  from expense  of 24 million  in 2017  to income  of 40 million  in 2018  mainly due to a foreign currency transaction gain on intercompany loans in 2018 

interest expense decreased  to 441 million  in 2018  from 449 million  in 2017  the decrease  was primarily due to slightly lower borrowings on the revolving credit facility during 2018 compared to 2017 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes increased  to 1184 million  in 2018  compared to 1180 million  in 2017  the effective tax rate decreased to 224 in 2018 compared to 259 in 2017 due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” including the onetime transition tax incurred in 2017 on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings the 14 decrease in the us statutory income tax rate and the introduction of the foreignderived intangible income “fdii” deduction as well as the excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation these amounts were offset by the removal of the domestic production activities deduction the new global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation and the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions 

net income for the year of 4106 million   increased  from 3373 million  in 2017  diluted earnings per share in 2018  of 529   increased   093  from 436  in 2017  

fluid  metering technologies segment 



sales of 9516 million   increased   706 million  or 8  in 2018  compared with 2017  this increase  reflected a 9   increase  in organic sales and a 1  favorable impact from foreign currency translation partially offset by a 2  decline  from a divestiture faure herman  october 2017 in 2018  sales were up 5  domestically and 12  internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 43  of total segment sales in 2018  compared with 42  in 2017  

sales within our pumps platform increased compared to 2017 due to strength in the north american industrial distribution market as well as strength in the oil and gas end market and lease automated custody transfer “lact” products sales within the water platform increased compared to 2017 due to strong international sales and increased project demand sales within our agriculture platform increased year over year due to broad based demand across both oem and distribution channels in north america and europe sales within the valves platform increased over 2017 primarily due to strong demand within the chemical end market in europe and asia sales within our energy platform decreased slightly compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the divestiture of our faure herman business in october 2017 partially offset by strong truck builds and project gains in the lpg end market 

operating income and operating margin of 2751 million  and 289  respectively were higher  than the 2410 million  and 274  respectively recorded in 2017  primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives partially offset by higher restructuring expenses in 2018 and the divestiture in 2017 

health  science technologies segment 



sales of 8964 million   increased   763 million  or 9  in 2018  compared with 2017  this increase  reflected a 6   increase  in organic sales a 2   increase  from acquisitions fli  july 2018 and thinxxs  december 2017 and a 1   favorable  impact

sales within our scientific fluidics  optics platform increased compared to 2017 due to new product introductions market share gains strong demand across our end markets including ivd biotechnology semiconductor and defense and the finger lakes instrumentation and thinxxs acquisitions sales within our material processing technologies platform increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the timing of several large projects in 2018  and continued demand within the pharmaceutical end market in asia partially offset by the impact of strategic changes in product focus which resulted in discontinued product offerings in 2017  sales within our sealing solutions platform increased compared to 2017 due to the extremely strong global demand in the semiconductor end market and strength in the energy automotive and industrial end markets sales in our gast platform increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the impact of oem tailwinds and higher distribution volume as well as new product introductions sales within our micropump platform increased compared to 2017 due to increasing demand in the printing end market 

operating income and operating margin of 2057 million  and 229  respectively in 2018  were up  from 1796 million  and 219  respectively in 2017  primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives partially offset by higher restructuring expenses in the current year related to site consolidations 

fire  safetydiversified products segment 



sales of 6370 million   increased   495 million  or 8  in 2018  compared with 2017  this increase  reflected a 7   increase  in organic sales and a 1  favorable impact from foreign currency translation in 2018  sales increased 6  domestically and 11  internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 53  of total segment sales in 2018  compared with 52  in 2017

sga expenses increased to 5249 million in 2017 from 4924 million in 2016 the 325 million increase is mainly attributable to 152 million of net incremental impact from acquisitions and divestitures as well as higher variable compensation and stock compensation expense as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 230 for 2017 and 233 for 2016

other income expense  net changed by 41 million from income of 17 million in 2016 to expense of 24 million in 2017 mainly due to a 47 million foreign exchange gain on intercompany loans in the prior year that did not repeat in 2017 due to the fact that the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the earnings impact associated with these intercompany loans 

interest expense decreased to 449 million in 2017 from 456 million in 2016 the decrease was primarily due to slightly lower borrowings in 2017 compared with 2016

critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset which is in line with shipping terms certain units recognize revenue over time because control transfers continuously to our customers revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation ie the costtocost method or is recognized ratably over the contract term as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our estimates regularly due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs will be revised such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catchup adjustment the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties primarily assurancetype and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived or indefinitelived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount additionally testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinitelived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets in 2018  and 2017  the company concluded that there were no longlived assets with a fair value that was less than the carrying value 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

 the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2018  and 2017  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considers both the market approach and the income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2019 ebitda 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements longterm growth rates and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

the banjo trade name and the akron brass trade name are indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach to determine the fair value of these trade names the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2018  and 2017  there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date in 2018  and 2017  there were no impairment charges recorded 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined after consulting with actuaries on a number of key assumptions and on information provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions idex adopts these annual updates and in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2018  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 25 million based 

upon the december 31 2018  data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 31 million based upon the december 31 2018  data

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2017  51  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 49  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil  gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water  wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

change to political and economic conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2017  approximately 49  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with 

new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates we maintain a revolving credit facility which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus in each case an applicable margin based on the companys senior unsecured longterm debt rating a significant increase in libor would significantly increase our cost of borrowings for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we are currently involved in pending and threatened legal and regulatory proceedings including asbestosrelated litigation and various legal regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business these proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes and may also involve governmental inquiries inspections audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters intellectual property environmental health and safety issues governmental regulations employment and other matters where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets or goodwill would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2017  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 17042 million  and 4147 million  respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 4 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be 

affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion   

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex while the company is able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in the corporate rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax the final impact of the tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in the company’s interpretations and assumptions additional guidance that may be issued by either the internal revenue service or the us department of treasury and actions the company may take

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

performance in 2017  compared with 2016   

  



sales in 2017  were 23 billion  an 8   increase  from last year this increase  reflects a 6   increase  in organic sales and a 2 increase  from acquisitionsdivestitures acquisitions thinxxs  december 2017 sfc koenig  september 2016 awg fittings  july 2016 and akron brass  march 2016  divestitures faure herman  october 2017 cvi korea  december 2016 ietg  october 2016 cvi japan  september 2016 and hydrastop  july 2016 sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 49 of total sales in 2017  compared with 50 in 2016  

in 2017  fluid  metering technologies contributed 38  of sales and 42  of operating income health  science technologies contributed 36  of sales and 32  of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products contributed 26  of sales and 26  of operating income 

gross profit of 10 billion in 2017   increased   959 million  or 10  from 2016  while gross margin increased 90 basis points to 449  in 2017  from 440  in 2016  the increase in gross profit and margin is primarily a result of increased sales volume and the dilutive impact in the prior year attributable to 147 million of fair value inventory stepup charges from 2016 acquisitions 

sga expenses increased  to 5249 million  in 2017  from 4924 million  in 2016  the 325 million   increase  is mainly attributable to 152 million of net incremental impact from acquisitions and divestitures as well as higher variable compensation and stock compensation expense as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 230  for 2017  and 233  for 2016  

in 2017 the company divested its faure herman business for a pretax gain of 93 million in 2016 the company divested four businesses during the year hydrastop  july 2016 cvi japan  september 2016 ietg  october 2016 and cvi korea  december 2016 for a pretax lossnet of 223 million 

in 2017  and 2016  the company incurred pretax restructuring expenses totaling 85 million  and 37 million  respectively as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate longterm sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization 

operating income of 5026 million  in 2017   increased  from 4124 million  in 2016  primarily due to a gain on a divestiture in 2017 compared to a net loss on four divestitures in 2016 higher sales volume and the 147 million of fair value inventory step up charges from 2016 acquisitions partially offset by higher restructuring costs in 2017 and overall higher sga costs in 2017 due to higher variable and sharebased compensation as well as outside consulting costs operating margin of 220  in 2017  was up   250  basis points from 195  in 2016  primarily due to the gain on the sale of a business in 2017 compared to a net loss on the sale of businesses in 2016 the dilutive impact in the prior year due to 147 million of fair value inventory stepup charges from 2016 acquisitions as well as higher volume and productivity initiatives 

other income expense  net changed by 41 million  from income  of 17 million  in 2016  to expense  of 24 million  in 2017  mainly due to a 47 million foreign exchange gain on intercompany loans in the prior year that did not repeat in 2017 due to the fact that the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the earnings impact associated with these intercompany loans 

interest expense decreased  to 449 million  in 2017  from 456 million  in 2016  the decrease  was primarily due to slightly lower borrowings in 2017 compared with 2016 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes increased  to 1180 million  in 2017  compared to 974 million  in 2016  the effective tax rate decreased  to 259  in 2017  compared to 264  in 2016  due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” a change in the permanent reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign subsidiaries as well as the incurrence of certain foreign income withholding taxes in the prior year these amounts were offset by the prior year tax benefits on the divestitures of cvi korea and cvi japan certain returntoprovision adjustments a partial change in the assertion of permanent reinvestment of certain foreign earnings as well as the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax act the tax act included significant changes to the existing tax law including but not limited to a permanent reduction to the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a onetime repatriation tax on deferred foreign income “transition tax” we have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the tax act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded a net 01 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the legislation was enacted although the net effect from the tax act was a 01 million tax benefit there were several offsetting adjustments including a 406 million provisional tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future 303 million of provisional tax expense related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings based on cumulative foreign earnings of 7790 million and an additional 102 million of tax expense primarily related to the removal of the permanent reinvestment representation with respect to certain of its subsidiaries in canada italy and germany 

the tax act also establishes new provisions that will affect the company’s 2018 results including but not limited to a reduction in the us corporate tax rate on domestic operations from 35 percent to 21 percent a tax on certain income from foreign operations global intangible lowtax income or “gilti” a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation

operating income of 1236 million was higher than the 1173 million in 2015 while operating margin of 238 was lower than the 277 in 2015 primarily due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins and the inventory stepup charges related to the akron brass and awg fittings acquisitions the higher operating income is primarily related to the impact of 2016 acquisitions 

liquidity and capital resources

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities changed from 465 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2016 to 2774 million  of cash used in financing activities in 2017  primarily as a result of higher payments under revolving facilities net of borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of 2000 million senior notes partially offset by a reduction of 282 million of purchases of common stock in 2017 and 73 million of lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options

critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 60525 revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangements  and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived or indefinitelived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount additionally testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinitelived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets in 2017  and 2016  the company concluded that certain longlived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in zero and 02 million  of longlived asset impairment charges respectively 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

 the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2017  and 2016  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

  

in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considers both the market approach and the income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2018 ebitda 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements longterm growth rates and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

the banjo trade name and the akron brass trade name are indefinitelived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach to determine the fair value of these trade names the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2017  and 2016  there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions idex adopts these annual updates and in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2017  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 29 million based upon the december 31 2017  data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 35 million based upon the december 31 2017  data

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2016  50  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 50  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil  gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water  wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

change to political and economic conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2016  approximately 50  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted in and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop 

products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates we maintain a revolving credit facility which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus in each case an applicable margin based on the companys senior unsecured longterm debt rating a significant increase in libor would significantly increase our cost of borrowings for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets or goodwill would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2016  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 16326 million  and 4355 million  respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 4 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital 

spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion   

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

performance in 2016  compared with 2015   

  



sales in 2016  were 21 billion  a 5   increase  from last year this increase  reflects a 1   decrease  in organic sales a 1 decrease  from foreign currency translation and a 7 increase  from acquisitionsdivestitures acquisitions sfc koenig  september 2016 awg fittings  july 2016 akron brass  march 2016 cidra precision services  july 2015 alfa valvole  june 2015 and novotema  june 2015 divestitures cvi korea  december 2016 ietg  october 2016 cvi japan  september 2016 hydrastop  july 2016 and ismatec  july 2015 sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 50 of total sales in both 2016  and 2015  

in 2016  fluid  metering technologies contributed 40 of sales and 44 of operating income health  science technologies contributed 35 of sales and 31 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products contributed 25 of sales and 25 of operating income

sga expenses increased  to 4990 million  in 2016  from 4794 million  in 2015  the 196 million   increase  is mainly attributable to 414 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions and 36 million of pension settlement charges in 2016 partially offset by current year divestitures and cost savings from prior year restructuring actions as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 236  for 2016  and 237  for 2015

operating income of 4058 million  in 2016   decreased  from 4317 million  in 2015  primarily resulted from the impact of the four divestitures in 2016 and the associated loss compared to the one divestiture in 2015 and the associated gain as well as the 36 million pension settlement charge in 2016 and the incremental fair value inventory stepup charges related to the 2016 acquisitions partially offset by the reversal of 47 million of contingent consideration related to a 2015 acquisition and lower restructuring costs recorded in 2016 compared to 2015 operating margin of 192  in 2016  was down   220  basis points from 214  in 2015  primarily due to the loss on the sale of businesses in 2016 compared to a gain on the sale of a business in 2015 and the 2016 pension settlement partially offset by productivity improvements and lower restructuring costs year over year 

other income expense increased   61 million  from income  of 22 million  in 2015  to income  of 83 million  in 2016  mainly due to 47 million of foreign currency transaction gains on intercompany loans that were established in conjunction with the sfc koenig acquisition 

interest expense increased  to 456 million  in 2016  from 416 million  in 2015  the increase  was primarily due to the 200 million series of senior notes issued in 2016 and higher borrowings outstanding on the revolving facility 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes decreased  to 974 million  in 2016  compared to 1095 million  in 2015  the effective tax rate decreased  to 264  in 2016  compared to 279  in 2015  due to tax benefits on the divestitures of cvi korea and cvi japan certain returntoprovision adjustments and the early adoption of asu 201609 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized as a reduction to income tax expense these adjustments were offset by the incurrence of additional foreign withholding taxes the prior year revaluation of the italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the italian statutory tax rate and tax expense on the divestiture of the hydrastop product line and the prior year divestiture of the ismatec product line as well as the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions

critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 60525 revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangements  and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an impairment of an indefinitelived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived or indefinitelived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount additionally testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinitelived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets in 2016  and 2015  the company concluded that certain longlived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in 02 million  and 08 million  respectively of longlived asset impairment charges 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

 the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2016  and 2015  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

  

in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considers both the market approach and the income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2017 ebitda generally 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements longterm growth rates and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

in addition to performing our annual impairment test we also performed interim impairment tests due to the divestitures in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the reorganization of certain reporting units as a result of these impairment tests the company concluded that the reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values 

the banjo trade name is an indefinitelived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

the akron brass trade name is an indefinitelived intangible asset that was acquired as a result of the akron brass acquisition in march 2016 and is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2016  and 2015  there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement as of october 31 2016  the fair value of the banjo trade name was more than 25 in excess of the carrying value and the fair value of the akron brass trade name was near its carrying value as a result of the acquisition of this business in march 2016 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions idex adopts these annual updates and in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2016  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 27 million based upon the december 31 2016  data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 33 million based upon the december 31 2016  data 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company may from time to time enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so a treasury risk management policy adopted by the board of directors describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps under the policy the company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers typically the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the company’s outstanding longterm debt

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2015  50  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 50  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue oil  gas paint and coatings chemical processing agriculture water  wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2015  approximately 50  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include the following 

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

the company’s sales were down   6  in 2015  approximately 8  of our 2015  sales were derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and 

services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2015  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 13965 million  and 2878 million  respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 4 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets 

a significant or sustained decline in commodity prices including oil could negatively impact the levels of expenditures by certain of our customers 

demand for our products depends in part on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers the level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on among other factors general economic conditions availability of credit economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior volatility in commodity prices including oil can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which   unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the company with uninterrupted leadership and direction the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to our company our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion   

we depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer store and support multiple business activities if these systems are damaged cease to function properly or are subject to cybersecurity attacks such as those involving unauthorized access malicious software andor other intrusions we could experience production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with all antibribery laws however we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries violations of these antibribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our 2015  financial results are as follows 

 our 2015  financial results adjusted for 112 million  of restructuring costs and an 181 million gain on the sale of a business are as follows these nongaap measures have been reconciled to us gaap measures in item 6 “selected financial data” 

 15 

overall we believe the current contraction of global economies will continue to pressure our end markets creating an unstable growth environment for 2016 based on the company’s current outlook we anticipate organic growth to be flat in 2016 with full year eps of 360 to 370 

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

performance in 2015  compared with 2014   

  



sales in 2015  were 20 billion  a 6   decrease  from the comparable period last year this decrease  reflects a 4 decrease in organic sales a 4 decrease from foreign currency translation and a 2 increase from acquisitions cidra precision services — july 2015 alfa valvole — june 2015 novotema — may 2015 and aegis — april 2014 sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 50 of total sales in both 2015  and 2014  

in 2015  fluid  metering technologies contributed 43  of sales and 43  of operating income health  science technologies contributed 36 of sales and 33  of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products contributed 21  of sales and 24  of operating income 

gross profit of 9043 million in 2015   decreased   450 million  or 5  from 2014  while gross margins increased 60 basis points to 448  in 2015  from 442  in 2014  the margin increase is mainly attributable to benefits from productivity initiatives partially offset by decreased sales volume 

sga expenses decreased  to 4794 million  in 2015  from 5044 million  in 2014  the 250 million   decrease  is mainly attributable to a reduction in volumerelated expenses of 351 million partially offset by approximately 101 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 237  for 2015  and 235  for 2014  

during 2015  the company recorded pretax restructuring expenses totaling 112 million  compared to 137 million  recorded in 2014  the restructuring expenses for both years were mainly attributable to employee severance related to head count reductions across all three segments and corporate 

operating income of 4317 million  in 2015   increased  slightly from the 4312 million  recorded in 2014  primarily reflecting improved productivity offset by decreased volumes operating margin of 214  in 2015  was up  130 basis points from 201  in 2014  primarily due to the gain on the sale of the ismatec product line and productivity improvements 

other income expense decreased   09 million  from other income  of 31 million  in 2014  to 22 million  of income  in 2015  mainly due to marktomarket gains in available for sale securities in 2014 compared to losses in 2015 

interest expense decreased  slightly to 416 million  in 2015  from 419 million  in 2014  the decrease  was primarily due to the maturation of the 258 senior euro notes partially offset by a higher balance on the revolving facility 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes decreased  to 1095 million  in 2015  compared to 1131 million  in 2014  the effective tax rate decreased  to 279  in 2015  compared to 288  in 2014  due to the revaluation of the italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the italian statutory tax rate the disposition of the ismatec product line and the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions 

net income for the year of 2828 million   increased  from the 2794 million  earned in 2014  diluted earnings per share in 2015  of 362   increased   017  from 345  in 2014  as a result of the gain on the sale of the ismatec product line and lower share count resulting from share repurchases partially offset by lower sales volume 

fluid  metering technologies segment 

  



sales of 8608 million   decreased   388 million  or 4  in 2015  compared with 2014  this decrease  reflected a 2 decline in organic growth a 2 increase from acquisitions alfa valvole — june 2015 and aegis — april 2014 and 4 of unfavorable foreign currency translation in 2015  sales decreased approximately 3 domestically and 5 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 44 of total segment sales in 2015  compared with 45 in 2014  

sales within our energy platform decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to the fall in oil prices and the related delay in large capital projects in europe and the middle east sales within our industrial platform similarly decreased compared to 2014 due to the fall in oil  gas prices but also due to the weakening of the north american industrial distribution market this decrease was partially offset by an increase in european chemical project activity sales within our agriculture platform decreased as oem and aftermarket distribution sales fell significantly due to depressed commodity prices and lower farm incomes the slight sales decrease in the water platform was driven by weakness in north american industrial markets offset by growth in the global municipal markets and share gains from new products sales in the valves platform which was created in the third quarter of 2015 increased as a result of the alfa acquisition 

operating income and operating margin of 2045 million  and 238  respectively were lower  than the 2169 million  and 241  respectively recorded in 2014  primarily due to the lower sales volume 

health  science technologies segment 

  



sales of 7390 million   decreased   130 million  or 2  in 2015  compared with 2014  this decrease  reflected a 1 decline in organic sales a 2 increase from acquisitions cidra precision services — july 2015 and novotema — may 2015 and 3 unfavorable foreign currency translation in 2015  sales decreased 3 domestically and 1 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 55 of total segment sales in 2015  compared with 54 in 2014  

sales within our scientific fluidics platform increased as demand from the core biotech invitro diagnostic and analytical instrumentation markets grew and remained consistently strong through the year sales within our material processing technologies platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softer orders in the first half of the year as general spending on large capital projects declined sales within our sealing solutions platform increased compared to 2014 due to the acquisition of novotema and strong growth in the semiconductor markets partially offset by declines in the oil  gas market sales within the idex optics and photonics platform decreased compared to 2014 primarily from slow demand in the industrial and laser optical end markets sales in our gast platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in north american industrial 

distribution markets sales in our micropump platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in asian printing markets and declines in the north american industrial distribution market 

operating income and operating margin of 1579 million  and 214  respectively in 2015  were up  from 1530 million  and 203  respectively recorded in 2014  primarily due to productivity initiatives partially offset by lower volume

critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 60525 revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition  and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from some longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an indefinite lived intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the market multiples forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates the 2015  and 2014  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

  



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considered both the market approach and income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and forward looking 2016 ebitda 50 each based on multiples of comparable public companies the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements long term growth rate and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

in 2015  and 2014  there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement as of october 31 2015  all reporting units had a fair value that was greater than 70 in excess of carrying value except for our iop and valves reporting unit our iop reporting unit had a fair value that was approximately 20  in excess of carrying value and our valves reporting unit had a fair value near its carrying value as a result of the formation of this reporting unit in conjunction with our alfa acquisition in june 2015 

the unamortized banjo trade name was determined to be an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2015  and 2014  there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement as of october 31 2015  the fair value of the banjo trade name was greater than 20 in excess of carrying value 

a longlived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets in 2015  and 2014  the company concluded that certain long lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in 08 million  and 25 million  respectively of impairment charges 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries recently released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2015  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years the new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 22 million based upon the december 31 2015  data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 26 million based upon the december 31 2015  data 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 which introduces a new fivestep revenue recognition model under asu 201409 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption the company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2014  50  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 50  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue liquefied petroleum gas paint and coatings chemical processing water  wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2014  approximately 50  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

the company’s sales grew 5  organically in 2014  and 2 in 2013  approximately 12  of our 2014  sales were derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and 

services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2014  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 13213 million  and 2712 million  respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth see note 4 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses managements primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 60525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from some longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also 

offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an indefinite lived intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the market multiples and terminal growth rates the 2014  and 2013  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

  



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considered both the market approach and income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures net working capital requirements long term growth rate and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

in 2014  and 2013  there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement as of october 31 2014  all reporting units had a fair value that was greater than 100 in excess of carrying value except for our iop reporting unit which had a fair value that was greater than 15 in excess of carrying value 

the unamortized banjo trade name was determined to be an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2014  and 2013  there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement as of october 31 2014  the fair value of the banjo trade name was greater than 40 in excess of carrying value 

a longlived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets in 2014  and 2013  the company concluded that certain long lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in 25 million and 27 million respectively of impairment charges 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

the society of actuaries recently released revised mortality tables which update life expectancy assumptions in consideration of these tables we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31 2014  which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years the new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation pbo which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately 27 million based upon the december 31 2014  data each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately 33 million based upon the december 31 2014  data 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 which introduces a new fivestep revenue recognition model under asu 201409 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 201409 recognized at the date of adoption the company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company may from time to time enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so a treasury risk management policy adopted by the board of directors describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps under the policy the company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers typically the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the company’s outstanding longterm debt 

the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the euro british pound canadian dollar indian rupee and chinese renminbi the company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products the foreign currency transaction losses for the period ending december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were 09 million  22 million  and 23 million  respectively and are reported within other income expensenet on the consolidated statements of operations 

the company’s interest rate exposure is primarily related to its 8640 million  of total debt outstanding at december 31 2014  approximately 13 of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market a 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximate 06 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows the remaining debt is fixed rate debt

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the sales and profitability of our businesses 

in 2013  49  of the company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 51  were derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue petroleum lpg paint and coatings chemical processing water  wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s sales and profitability 

conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2013  approximately 51  of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our sales growth 

the company’s sales grew 2  organically in 2013  and 3  in 2012  approximately 12  of our 2013 sales were derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or otherwise prove beneficial to us 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may 

require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound indian rupee and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2013  goodwill and intangible assets totaled 13495 million  and 3112 million  respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth as an example in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 the company concluded that a significant noncash asset impairment charge of 1985 million was required in the fourth quarter of 2012 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets within the iop platform and goodwill and longlived assets within the wst group see note 4 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets

results of operations 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  for purposes of this item reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses 

in the following discussion and throughout this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 the impact of foreign currency translation and 2 sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult in addition this report references ebitda and adjusted ebitda these nongaap measures have been reconciled to net income and operating income within item 6 selected financial data given the acquisitive nature of the company which results in a higher level of amortization expense at recently acquired businesses ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides management with a better representation of performance of businesses across our three segments 

management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin in addition due to the highly acquisitive nature of the company the determination of net income includes amortization of acquired intangible assets and as a result management reviews ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of sales these measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are analyzed with segment management 

performance in 2013  compared with 2012

sales of 8718 million   increased   385 million  or 5 in 2013  compared with 2012  this increase reflected 4 organic growth and 1 favorable foreign currency translation the increase in organic sales was attributable to growth across all our platforms and groups within the segment in 2013  organic sales increased approximately 3 domestically and 6 internationally organic sales to customers outside the us were approximately 46 of total segment sales in 2013  compared with 47 in 2012  

sales within our energy platform increased compared to 2012  due to the strength of oem truck builds and electronic retrofits in north america additional growth has been driven by growth across the lpg market including north america china india and russia sales within our cfp platform increased compared to 2012  on   continued strength in the chemical markets particularly with project opportunities in the middle east and asia coupled with solid aftermarket performance the cfp north american industrial distribution market started the year soft but gradually recovered in the second half of 2013 sales increases within our agriculture group were driven by strong oem demand in north america new product introductions and an increase in market share the sales increase in wst was driven by share gains and strong global project activity specifically for projects in the us and japan ddpt saw only modest sales growth due to softness in several core markets but this was offset by a pickup in the middle east and the semiconductor markets 

operating income and operating margin of 2113 million  and 242  respectively were higher  than the 1467 million  and 176  recorded in 2012  primarily due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of the 277 million of impairment charges and 63 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2012

platform increased on the success of new products introduced throughout 2013 and share gains in the latter part of 2013 scientific fluidics benefited from the the easing of national institute of health funding constraints which opened up further spending in our core analytical instruments and in vitro diagnostic markets sales within our specialty seals group increased compared to 2012 due to a full nine months of sales from ftl acquired in march 2013 continued strong growth in oil  gas and stability in the scientific and commercial aircraft end markets sales within our iop platform decreased compared to 2012 primarily from continued weak demand in the defense biotechnology and electronics end markets as well as the decision to exit certain product lines sales in our industrial group decreased compared to 2012 due to several original equipment manufacturer “oem” orders that did not repeat in 2013 

operating income and operating margin of 1367 million  and 191 respectively in 2013  were up  from the operating loss and negative operating margin of 628 million  and 90 respectively recorded in 2012  primarily due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of the 1708 million of impairment charges and the 147 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2012

critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 60525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from some longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also 

offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an indefinite lived intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the market multiples and terminal growth rates the 2013  and 2012  ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

  



in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considered both the market approach and income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures other operating costs and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 

in 2013 there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date based on the results of our measurement at october 31 2013 all reporting units had a fair value that was significantly in excess of carrying value except for our iop reporting unit which had a fair value greater than 10 above carrying value the iop reporting unit was written down to its fair value in 2012 as result of our goodwill impairment and thus the fair value continues to be near the carrying value 

in 2012 as a result of our annual impairment test for the iop reporting unit and as a result of the reorganization of certain fmt reporting units the company determined that the fair value of the iop and wst reporting units was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting units and thus the company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test in step two of the goodwill impairment test the company determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value which resulted in a 1498 million goodwill impairment charge at the iop reporting unit and a 207 million impairment charge at the wst reporting unit 

the unamortized banjo trade name was determined to be an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that the asset might be impaired the company uses the relieffromroyalty method a form of the income approach the relieffromroyalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of revenues royalty rates and discount rates 

in 2013 there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date and the company concluded that the fair value of the banjo trade name was in excess of the carrying value as of october 31 2013 

in 2012 as a result of our annual impairment test the company concluded that the fair value of the cvi melles griot trade names within the iop reporting unit was less than the carrying value resulting in a 210 million  impairment charge the company also determined that the cvi melles griot trade names no longer had an indefinite life and reclassified the remaining 260 million  to definite lived assets that will be amortized over a remaining useful life of 15  years 

a longlived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations the amount and   timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets in 2013 the company concluded that certain long lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in 27 million of impairment charges in 2012 the company concluded that certain long lived assets within the wst reporting unit had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in a 70 million  impairment charge 

defined benefit retirement plans —  the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation pbo which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease or increase respectively in the pbo of an estimated 230 million based upon the december 31 2013  data 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements

 item 1a risk factors tableend for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors present risks to the company and could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report the most significant of these factors are as follows 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of any of our businesses 

in 2012 49 of the company’s revenue was derived from domestic operations while 51 was derived from international operations the company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue petroleum lpg paint and coatings chemical processing water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components a slowdown in the us or global economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could reduce the company’s revenues and profitability 

conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

in 2012 approximately 51 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our revenue growth 

the company’s revenue grew 3 organically in 2012 and 9 in 2011 approximately 14 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove beneficial to us 

  

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive and this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our revenues operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2012 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 13217 million and 3414 million respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net 

  

assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” no 350 the company concluded that a significant noncash impairment charge of 1985 million was required in the fourth quarter of 2012 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets within the iop platform and goodwill and longlived assets within the wst platform see note 4 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets

in this report references to organic sales a nongaap measure refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes 1 sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership and 2 the impact of foreign currency translation the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in organic sales and b the periodtoperiod change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends the company excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of longterm performance difficult 

management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales operating income and operating margin in addition due to the highly acquisitive nature of the company the determination of operating income includes amortization of acquired intangible assets and as a result management reviews depreciation and 

  

amortization as a percentage of sales these measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are analyzed with segment management 

performance in 2012 compared with 2011 

 

 sales in 2012 were 19543 million a 6 increase from the comparable period last year this increase reflects a 3 increase in organic sales 5 from acquisitions at films — january 2011 microfluidics — march 2011 cvi mg — june 2011 erc — april 2012 and matcon — july 2012 and 2 unfavorable foreign currency translation organic sales to customers outside the us represented approximately 50 of total sales in the period compared with 52 in 2011 

in 2012 fluid  metering technologies contributed 43 of sales and 82 of operating income health  science technologies accounted for 35 of sales and 35 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products represented 22 of sales and 53 of operating income 

gross profit of 8037 million in 2012 increased 650 million or 9 from 2011 gross margins were 411 in 2012 and 402 in 2011 

sga expenses increased to 4445 million in 2012 from 4217 million in 2011 the 228 million increase reflects approximately 268 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions 27 million for a benefit from forfeited ceo equity compensation recorded in 2011 and a 28 million gain from the sale of a facility in italy recorded in 2011 partially offset by 95 million of cost savings initiatives as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 227 for 2012 and 229 for 2011 

during 2012 the company recorded pretax restructuring expenses totaling 325 million compared with 123 million for the same period in 2011 these restructuring expenses were mainly attributable to employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas the termination of a defined benefit pension plan and facility rationalization resulting from the company’s cost savings initiatives these initiatives included exit costs related to five facility closures and severance benefits for 491 employees in 2012 and severance benefits for 292 employees in 2011 

the company concluded that a noncash impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets within the iop reporting unit and goodwill and longlived assets within the wst reporting unit the goodwill within iop primarily originated from the 2011 acquisition of cvi melles griot and the goodwill in wst primarily originated from the 2008 acquisitions of ietg and ads as a result of our annual test an impairment charge was required within iop due to continued softness in the optics  photonics end markets in addition we were required to perform an interim impairment test within wst at december 31 2012 due to the reorganization of certain fmt businesses in the fourth quarter this reorganization combined with continued softness in municipal end markets contributed to the impairment charge as a result of the above testing the company recorded a pretax charge of 1985 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 this noncash asset impairment charge will not affect our liquidity operations or ongoing financial performance 

  

no additional impairments were identified at any of the other reporting units 

operating income of 1282 million in 2012 was down from the 3047 million recorded in 2011 primarily reflecting 1985 million of asset impairment charges and an increase of 202 million in restructuringrelated charges partially offset by an increase in volume and improved productivity operating margin of 66 in 2012 was down from 166 in 2011 primarily due to the impact of asset impairment charges and restructuringrelated charges as well as the dilutive impact from acquisitions partially offset by volume leverage and productivity 

interest expense increased to 423 million in 2012 from 293 million in 2011 the increase was principally due to higher debt levels resulting from the cvi mg acquisition and higher interest rates associated with converting our revolving facility debt in 2011 to fixed rate 42 senior notes 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes decreased to 486 million in 2012 compared to 800 in 2011 the effective tax rate increased to 563 in 2012 compared to 292 in 2011 mainly due to the nonrecurring asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 the impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 269 our effective tax rate was also impacted by the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions a reversal of disallowed executive compensation expense in the prior year and the impact of recent acquisitions 

in january 2013 legislation was enacted to extend the federal research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits through december 31 2013 as a result we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit for the research and development credit which was extended retroactively to january 1 2012 

net income for the year of 376 million decreased from the 1939 million earned in 2011 diluted earnings per share in 2012 of 045 decreased 187 or 81 from 232 in 2011

an operating loss of 628 million in 2012 was down from the 1060 million of income recorded in 2011 primarily due to 1708 million of impairment charges and 147 million of current period restructuring charges partially offset by the 158 million acquisition fair value inventory charge for cvi mg recorded in 2011 and productivity from prior period restructuring actions a negative operating margin of 90 in 2012 was down from 174 in 2011 due to the dilutive impact from acquisitions current period restructuring charges and impairment charges

 critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 60525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from some longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known 

  

trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an indefinite lived intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 st or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the market multiples and terminal growth rates the 2012 and 2011 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

 

 in prior periods the company disclosed certain reporting units for which the estimated fair value did not significantly exceed carrying value assumptions used in estimating fair value included successful execution of business forecasts and favorable market conditions consistent with the company’s approach in its annual impairment testing in assessing the fair value of the reporting units the company considered both the market approach and income approach under the market approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results capital expenditures other operating costs and discount rates weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches 50 each in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units as a result of our annual impairment test for the iop reporting unit and as a result of the reorganization of certain fmt reporting units the 

  

company determined that the fair value of the iop and wst reporting units was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting units and thus the company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test 

in step two of the goodwill impairment test the company determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value which resulted in a 1498 million goodwill impairment charge at the iop reporting unit and a 207 million impairment charge at the wst reporting unit 

the unamortized banjo trade name and the cvi melles griot trade names were determined to be indefinite lived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as a result of our annual impairment test the company concluded that the fair value of the cvi melles griot trade names within the iop reporting unit was less than the carrying value resulting in a 210 million impairment charge the company also determined that the cvi melles griot trade names no longer had an indefinite life and reclassified the remaining 260 million to definite lived assets that will be amortized over a remaining useful life of 15 years 

a longlived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of longlived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets as a result of the reorganization of certain fmt reporting units the company concluded that certain long lived assets within the wst reporting unit had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets resulting in a 70 million impairment charge no additional impairments were identified at any of the other reporting units 

defined benefit retirement plans — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the gain loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation pbo which in turn may impact the company’s funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets each 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease or increase respectively in the pbo of an estimated 250 million based upon the december 31 2012 data

in june 2011 fasb issued asu 201105 “presentation of comprehensive income” asu 201105 allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity while asu 201105 changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance in december 2011 fasb issued asu 201112 “comprehensive income topic 220 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105” asu 201112 deferred certain aspects of asu 201105 the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 the company adopted asu 201105 and the deferrals in asu 201112 on january 1 2012 and the adoption did not impact the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company 

new accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment” asu 201202 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinitelived intangible asset under asu 201202 an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset if the entity determines based on qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not impaired the revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 however early adoption is permitted as of december 31 2012 the company did not elect to early adopt asu 201202 however it is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company

in 2011 approximately 53 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on the company’s operations 

our inability to continue to develop new products could limit our revenue growth 

the company’s revenue grew 9 organically in 2011 and 12 in 2010 approximately 15 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing which may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in addition any acquisition once successfully integrated may not perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to us 

  

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses 

the markets we serve are highly competitive this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality price design and engineering capabilities product development conformity to customer specifications quality of postsale support timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of our distribution channels maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our revenues operating margins and overall financial performance 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect us 

we currently are involved in several legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

our intangible assets including goodwill are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2011 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 14314 million and 3822 million respectively these assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth

performance in 2011 compared with 2010 

sales in 2011 of 18385 million were 22 higher than the 15131 million recorded a year ago this increase reflects a 9 increase in organic sales 11 from seven acquisitions ppe — april 2010 obl — july 2010 periflo — september 2010 fitzpatrick — november 2010 at films — january 2011 microfluidics — march 2011 and cvi mg — june 2011 and 2 favorable foreign currency translation organic sales increased in fluid  metering technologies health  science technologies and fire  safetydiversified products segments but declined in the dispensing equipment segment domestic organic sales were up 4 versus the prior year while international organic sales increased 15 organic sales to customers outside the us represented 52 of total sales in 2011 and 49 in 2010 

in 2011 fluid  metering technologies contributed 44 of sales and 45 of operating income health  science technologies accounted for 34 of sales and 31 of operating income dispensing equipment accounted for 6 of sales and 4 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products represented 16 of sales and 20 of operating income 

fluid  metering technologies sales of 8169 million in 2011 increased 1120 million or 16 compared with 2010 this reflects a 13 increase in organic sales 1 for acquisitions obl and periflo and 2 favorable foreign currency translation the increase in organic sales was driven by strong global growth in our agriculture chemical and energy end markets in 2011 organic sales increased approximately 9 domestically and 19 internationally organic sales to customers outside the us were approximately 48 of total segment sales in 2011 and 46 in 2010 

health  science technologies sales of 6223 million increased 2001 million or 47 in 2011 compared with last year this change reflects a 9 increase in organic growth 37 for acquisitions ppe fitzpatrick at films microfluidics and cvi mg and 1 favorable foreign currency translation the increase in organic sales 

  

reflects market strength across all health  science technologies product markets in 2011 organic sales increased 2 domestically and 17 internationally organic sales to customers outside the us were approximately 51 of total segment sales in 2011 and 47 in 2010 

dispensing equipment sales of 1174 million decreased 79 million or 6 in 2011 compared with the prior year this change reflects an 11 organic decline partially offset by a 5 favorable foreign currency translation the decrease in organic sales was due to market softness in north america partially offset by strength in eastern europe and asia organic sales decreased 36 domestically primarily due to north american replenishment programs in 2010 and increased 2 internationally organic sales to customers outside the us were 76 of total segment sales in 2011 and 67 in 2010 

fire  safetydiversified products sales of 2850 million increased 195 million or 7 in 2011 compared with 2010 this change reflects 5 organic growth and a 2 favorable foreign currency translation the change in organic sales reflects strength in rescue equipment and engineered band clamping systems partially offset by weakness in fire suppression in 2011 organic sales increased 3 domestically and 6 internationally organic sales to customers outside the us were 56 of total segment sales for both 2011 and 2010 

gross profit of 7387 million in 2011 was 1202 million or 19 higher than 2010 as a percentage of sales gross profit was 402 in 2011 a 70 basispoint decrease from 409 in 2010 the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects acquisition fair value inventory charges of 158 million related to our cvi mg acquisition partially offset by higher volume and product mix 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased to 4217 million in 2011 from 3583 million in 2010 the 634 million increase reflects approximately 167 million in volumerelated expenses 464 million for incremental costs associated with acquisitions and 58 million of acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by a 28 million gain from the sale of a facility in italy and 27 million from the reversal of previously recorded share based compensation costs related to the ceo transition as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 229 for 2011 and 237 for 2010 

during 2011 the company recorded pretax restructuring expenses totaling 123 million while 111 million was recorded for the same period in 2010 these restructuring expenses were mainly attributable to employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas and facility rationalization resulting from the company’s cost savings initiatives these initiatives included severance benefits for 292 employees in 2011 and 215 in 2010 the current restructuring initiative will continue into 2012 with severance payments to be fully paid by the end of 2012 using cash from operations 

operating income increased 555 million or 22 to 3047 million in 2011 from 2491 million in 2010 this increase primarily reflects an increase in volume improved productivity and a gain from the sale of a facility in italy partially offset by acquisition fair value inventory charges and acquisitionrelated costs operating margins in 2011 were 166 of sales compared with 165 recorded in 2010 

in the fluid  metering technologies segment operating income of 1600 million and operating margins of 196 in 2011 were up from the 1272 million and 180 recorded in 2010 principally due to higher sales sourcing initiatives strategic pricing and cost control in the health  science technologies segment operating income of 1109 million in 2011 was up from the 870 million recorded in 2010 due to volume leverage improved mix with new products and increased content on oem platforms partially offset by the inventory fair value charge associated with the cvi mg acquisition operating margin in the health  science technologies segment of 178 in 2011 was down from 206 in 2010 primarily due to the inventory fair value charge associated with the cvi mg acquisition partially offset by higher volume in the dispensing equipment segment operating income of 154 million and operating margins of 131 in 2011 were down from the 195 million and 156 operating margins recorded in 2010 primarily due to lower volume and restructuring 

  

related costs partially offset by a gain from the sale of a facility in italy operating income and operating margins in the fire  safetydiversified products segment of 705 million and 247 respectively were higher than the 628 million and 237 recorded in 2010 primarily due to volume leverage and favorable product mix the company incurred 226 million of acquisition related transaction costs and fair value inventory charges in 2011 of which 58 million was recorded in sga expense and 168 million was recorded in cost of sales 

other expense of 14 million in 2011 was higher than the 11 million expense in 2010 primarily due to higher losses on foreign currency transactions and a loss on an interest rate contract settlement partially offset by an increase in interest income 

interest expense increased to 293 million in 2011 from 162 million in 2010 the increase was principally due to higher debt levels resulting from the funding of the cvi mg acquisition and a higher interest rate associated with the 45 senior notes issued in december 2010 with a 58 effective interest rate 

the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal state and foreign income the provision for income taxes increased to 800 million for 2011 compared to 748 million in 2010 the effective tax rate decreased to 292 for 2011 compared to 322 in 2010 primarily due to the mix of global pretax income among jurisdictions and as a result of recent acquisitions

 critical accounting policies 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 60525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 st or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

  

the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital market data and market multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the market multiples and terminal growth rates the 2011 and 2010 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

 

 the company concluded that the fair value of each of its reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of october 31 2011 and thus no goodwill impairment was identified however a 10 decrease in the fair value of the water reporting unit within the fluid  metering technologies segment could potentially result in a goodwill impairment charge the total goodwill balance of the water reporting unit as of october 31 2011 was 2223 million 

defined benefit retirement plans — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of those operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

 

in 2010 51 of the company’s revenue was derived from domestic operations while 49 was derived from international operations the company’s largest markets include life sciences and medical technologies fire and rescue petroleum lpg paint and coatings chemical processing and water and wastewater treatment a slowdown in the economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could directly affect the company’s revenue stream and profitability 

 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

 

in 2010 approximately 49 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 

  

we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on the company’s operations 

 

an inability to continue to develop new products can limit the company’s revenue and profitability 

 

the company’s revenue grew organically by 12 in 2010 but was down 14 in 2009 approximately 19 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our ability to continue to develop new products 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include acquisitions we intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot be assured however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing which may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure you that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

 

the markets we serve are highly competitive this competition could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins 

 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality price design and engineering capabilities product development conformity to customer specifications quality of postsale support timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of our distribution channels maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

 

while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

an unfavorable outcome of any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we currently are involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

 

our intangible assets are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets could adversely impact our operating results and significantly reduce our net worth 

 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2010 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 12070 million and 2814 million respectively these goodwill and intangible assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill or intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of the goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and total capitalization

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the company and nine of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestosrelated personal injuries allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos these components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by any of the subsidiaries to date the majority of the company’s settlements and legal costs except for costs of coordination administration insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs have been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable deductibles however the company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover such settlements and legal costs or how insurers may respond 

to claims that are tendered to them claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the united states most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment the balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts only one case has been tried resulting in a verdict for the company’s business unit no provision has been made in the financial statements of the company other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course and the company does not currently believe the asbestosrelated claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flow

value of the reporting unit to its carrying value it was determined that the fair value of fluid management was less than the carrying value of the net assets the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill the company’s analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 212 million

interest expense decreased to 172 million in 2009 from 189 million in 2008 the decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment the replacement of 1500 million of debt with a lower interest rate borrowing in february 2008 and the conversion of 3500 million floatingrate debt into fixedrates 

 

the provision for income taxes decreased to 554 million in 2009 from 652 million in 2008 the effective tax rate decreased to 328 in 2009 from 339 in 2008 due to changes in the mix of global pretax income among taxing jurisdictions

at december 31 2010 working capital was 3391 million and the company’s current ratio was 20 to 1 cash flows from operating activities decreased 281 million or 13 to 1845 million in 2010 primarily due to the settlement of the forward starting interest rate contract entered into during 2010 in connection with the 3000 million 45 senior notes issued in december 2010 

 

cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of 328 million and 255 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity and tooling to support the global sourcing initiatives although a portion was for business system technology and replacement of equipment and facilities management believes that the company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet expected needs for future growth in the intermediate term

on december 6 2010 the company completed a public offering of 3000 million 45 notes due december 15 2020 “45 senior notes” the net proceeds from the offering of approximately 2957 million after deducting the 16 million issuance discount the 19 million underwriting commission and estimated offering expenses of approximately 08 million was used to repay 2500 million of outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility the balance of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes the 45 senior notes will bear interest at a rate of 45 per annum which is payable semiannually in arrears each june 15 and december 15 beginning june 15 2011 the company may redeem all or part of the 45 senior notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the note indenture “indenture” governing the 

45 senior notes the company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the indenture the indenture and 45 senior notes contain covenants that limit the company’s ability to among other things incur certain liens securing indebtedness engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and enter into certain consolidations mergers conveyances transfers or leases of all or substantially all the company’s assets the terms of the 45 senior notes also require the company to make an offer to repurchase 45 senior notes upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any 

 

on april 15 2010 the company entered into a forward starting interest rate contract with a notional amount of 3000 million with a settlement date in december 2010 this contract was entered into in anticipation of the issuance of the 3000 million 45 senior notes and was designed to lock in the market interest rate as of april 15 2010 the company settled this interest rate contract in december 2010 resulting in a 310 million payment the 310 million will be amortized into interest expense over the 10 year term of the 45 senior notes yielding an effective interest rate of 58 

 

there are two key financial covenants that the company is required to maintain in connection with the credit facility term loan and 258 senior euro notes there are no financial covenants relating to the 45 senior notes the most restrictive financial covenants under these debt instruments require a minimum interest coverage ratio operating cash flow to interest of 30 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio outstanding debt to operating cash flow of 325 to 1 at december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants the company expects to be in compliance with both of these key financial covenants throughout 2011 

 

on april 21 2008 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1250 million of its outstanding common shares repurchases under the new program will be funded with cash flow generation and made from time to time in either the open market or through private transactions the timing volume and nature of share repurchases will be at the discretion of management dependent on market conditions other priorities for cash investment applicable securities laws and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time no shares were purchased in 2010 or 2009 

 

we expect our current cash and cash that will be generated from operations during 2011 will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements planned capital expenditures interest on all borrowings required debt repayments pension and postretirement funding requirements and annual dividend payments to holders of the company’s stock during the next twelve months additionally in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings our current intention if the available terms and conditions are acceptable is to enter into a new revolving credit facility agreement during 2011 since the existing credit facility matures on december 21 2011 as of december 31 2010 278 million is outstanding under the existing credit facility and 900 million is outstanding under the term loan and both are classified as short term borrowings on the balance sheet we expect our cash and cash from operations to be adequate to repay these balances during 2011 

 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans rental payments under operating leases payments under capital leases and other longterm obligations arising in the ordinary course of business there are no identifiable events or uncertainties including the lowering of our credit rating that would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2010 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings additional detail

critical accounting policies 

 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 9856525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the fair value of each accounting unit revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

sharebased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of asc topic 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and applies the binomial lattice optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options the binomial lattice optionpricing model incorporates certain assumptions such as the expected volatility riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected forfeiture rate and expected life of options in order to arrive at a fair value estimate as a result sharebased compensation expense as calculated and recorded under asc 718 could have been impacted if other assumptions were used furthermore if the company used different assumptions in future periods sharebased compensation expense could be impacted in future periods see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional information 

 

inventory  — the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market cost which includes material labor and factory overhead is determined on a fifo basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand product life cycle and engineering changes 

 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company ebitda multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

 

the key assumptions are updated each year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital comparable transactions market data and ebitda multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the ebitda multiples and terminal growth rates the 2010 and 2009 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

 

 

 

the company concluded that the fair value of each of its reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of october 31 2010 and thus no goodwill impairment was identified 

 

income taxes  — the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 — “income taxes” under asc 740 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects 

of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

 

contingencies and litigation — we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and as required and where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

 

defined benefit retirement plans — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

the recent financial crisis and current uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit equity and fixed income markets there could be a number of followon effects from these economic developments on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies decreased customer confidence and decreased customer demand including order delays or cancellations 

 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

 

in 2009 53 of the company’s revenue was derived from domestic operations while 47 was international the company’s largest markets include life sciences  medical technologies fire and rescue petroleum lpg paint and coatings chemical processing and water  wastewater treatment a slowdown in the economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could directly affect the company’s revenue stream and profitability 

 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

 

in 2009 approximately 47 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to earnings for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include the following 

 

• possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations 

 

• risks of economic instability 

 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation 

• potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies 

 

• the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances 

 

• changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements and 

 

• insurrection or war 

 

we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on the company’s operations 

 

an inability to continue to develop new products can limit the company’s revenue and profitability 

 

the company’s organic growth was down 14 in 2009 and flat in 2008 approximately 20 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our ability to continue to develop new products 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include in large part our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations 

 

we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot be assured however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing which may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure you that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

 

the markets we serve are highly competitive this competition could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins 

 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality price design and engineering capabilities product development conformity to customer specifications quality of postsale support timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of our distribution channels maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we cannot be assured that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive we cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

 

while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

an unfavorable outcome with regards to any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we currently are involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 legal proceedings 

 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any period of an unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates the company’s interest rate exposure was primarily related to the 4001 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2009 the majority of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market in order to mitigate this interest exposure the company entered into interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted 3450 million of our floatingrate debt to a fixed rate a 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the remaining 551 million floatingrate debt would result in an approximate 03 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flow for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

our intangible assets are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets could cause a major impact on the company’s net worth 

 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2009 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 11804 million and 2814 million respectively these goodwill and intangible assets result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill or intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of the goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and total capitalization in accordance with accounting 

standards codification “asc” 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other” the company concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed in 2008 which required the company to record a goodwill impairment of 301 million at fluid management a reporting unit within the company’s dispensing equipment segment see note 5 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestosrelated personal injuries allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos such components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by any of the subsidiaries to date the majority of the company’s settlements and legal costs except for costs of coordination administration insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs have been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable deductibles however the company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover such settlements and legal costs or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them 

 

claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the united states most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment the balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts only one case has been tried resulting in a verdict for the company’s business unit 

 

no provision has been made in the financial statements of the company other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course and the company does not currently believe the asbestosrelated claims will have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flow 

 

the company is also party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or cash flow

results of operations 

 

on july 1 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc became the authoritative source of accounting principals to be applied to financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in accordance with the asc citations to accounting literature in this report are to the relevant topic of the asc or are presented in plain english 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 for purposes of this discussion and analysis section reference is made to the table on page 17 and the consolidated statements of operations in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data on page 28 we changed our method of accounting for inventory from the lifo method to the fifo method effective january 1 2009 and applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein see note 2 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

performance in 2009 compared with 2008 

 

sales in 2009 of 13297 million were 11 lower than the 14895 million recorded a year ago this decrease reflects a 14 decrease in organic sales and 2 unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a 5 increase from four acquisitions richter — october 2008 ipek — october 2008 ietg — october 2008 and semrock — october 2008 organic sales decreased in all four of the company’s reporting segments domestic organic sales were down 13 versus the prior year while international organic sales were down 15 in 2009 sales to customers outside the us represented 47 of total sales in both 2009 and 2008 

 

in 2009 fluid  metering technologies contributed 48 of sales and 44 of operating income health  science technologies accounted for 23 of both sales and operating income dispensing equipment accounted for 9 of sales and 7 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products represented 20 of sales and 26 of operating income 

 

fluid  metering technologies sales of 6411 million in 2009 decreased 566 million or 8 compared with 2008 this reflects a 16 decline in organic sales and 1 of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a 9 increase for acquisitions richter ipek and ietg the decrease in organic growth was driven by weakness in chemical energy water and wastewater markets in 2009 organic sales declined approximately 16 both domestically and internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 46 of total segment sales in 2009 and 41 in 2008 

 

health  science technologies sales of 3043 million decreased 273 million or 8 in 2009 compared with last year this change represents a 12 decrease in organic volume and 1 unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a 5 increase from the acquisition of semrock the decrease in organic sales reflects market softness in both core and noncore health  science technologies businesses in 2009 organic sales decreased 13 domestically and 10 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 39 of total segment sales in both 2009 and 2008 

 

dispensing equipment sales of 1273 million decreased 366 million or 22 in 2009 compared with the prior year organic sales decreased 18 while foreign currency translation accounted for 4 of the decrease the decrease in organic growth was due to continued deterioration in capital spending in the european and north american markets organic domestic sales increased 8 compared with 2008 while organic international sales decreased 27 sales to customers outside the us were 64 of total segment sales in 2009 down from 74 in 2008 

 

fire  safetydiversified products sales of 2628 million decreased 377 million or 13 in 2009 compared with 2008 organic sales activity decreased 9 while foreign currency translation accounted for 4 of the decrease the decrease in organic business growth was driven by lower demand for engineered band clamping systems and lower levels of municipal spending in 2009 organic sales decreased 12 domestically and 7 internationally sales to customers outside the us were 53 of total segment sales in 2009 and 54 in 2008 

 

gross profit of 5224 million in 2009 was 750 million or 13 lower than 2008 as a percent of sales gross profit was 393 in 2009 which represented an 80 basispoint decrease from 401 in 2008 the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects lower volume and product mix 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 3255 million in 2009 from 3434 million in 2008 the 179 million decrease reflects approximately 407 million for restructuring related savings and volume related expenses partially offset by a 228 million increase for incremental costs associated with recently acquired businesses as a percent of net sales sga expenses were 245 for 2009 and 231 in 2008 

in 2009 the company concluded that the fair value of each of its reporting units was in excess of its carrying value as of october 31 2009 and thus no goodwill impairment was identified however a 10 decrease in fair value of the banjo or the water reporting units within the fluid  metering technologies segment could potentially result in a goodwill impairment charge at these reporting units the total goodwill balance for these two reporting units as of october 31 2009 was 2887 million in 2008 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 301 million the company concluded in accordance with asc 350 that events had occurred and circumstances had changed which required the company to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test at fluid management a reporting unit within the company’s dispensing equipment segment fluid management had experienced a downturn in capital spending by its customer base and the loss of market share the company performed an impairment test and compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value it was determined that the fair value of fluid management was less than the carrying value of the net assets the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill the company’s analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 212 million 

 

in 2009 and 2008 the company recorded pretax restructuring expenses totaling 121 million and 180 million respectively for employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas and facility closures resulting from the company’s cost savings initiatives these initiatives included severance benefits for 478 employees in 2009 and 380 in 2008 the company is anticipating the employee reductions to be completed by mid 2010 with an expected additional total cost of 40 — 50 million in 2010 with severance payments expected to be fully paid by the end of 2011 using cash from operations 

 

operating income decreased 211 million or 10 to 1849 million in 2009 from 2060 million in 2008 this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in volume partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 and the impact from acquisitions operating margins in 2009 were 139 of sales compared with 138 recorded in 2008 

 

in the fluid  metering technologies segment operating income of 1003 million and operating margins of 156 in 2009 were down from the 1238 million and 177 recorded in 2008 principally due to lower sales in the health  science technologies segment operating income of 517 million and operating margins of 170 in 2009 were down from the 583 million and 176 recorded in 2008 due to lower volume in the dispensing equipment segment operating income of 151 million and operating margins of 119 in 2009 were up from the 107 million of operating loss recorded in 2008 due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 partially offset by continued deterioration in the north american and european markets operating income and operating margins in the fire  safetydiversified products segment of 599 million and 228 respectively were lower than the 743 million and 247 recorded in 2008 due primarily to lower volume and unfavorable product mix

in 2008 fluid  metering technologies contributed 47 of sales and 50 of operating income health  science technologies accounted for 22 of sales and 24 of operating income dispensing equipment accounted for 11 of sales and 4 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products represented 20 of sales and 30 of operating income 

 

fluid  metering technologies sales of 6977 million in 2008 rose 1274 million or 22 compared with 2007 the acquisition of quadro ads richter ipek and ietg accounted for 18 of the increase while organic growth increased 4 in 2008 organic sales grew approximately 2 domestically and 6 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 41 of total segment sales in 2008 and 42 in 2007

sga expenses increased to 3434 million in 2008 from 3134 million in 2007 this increase primarily relates to our recent acquisitions as a percent of net sales sga expenses were 231 for both 2008 and 2007 

in 2008 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 301 million the company concluded in accordance with asc 350 that events had occurred and circumstances had changed which required the company to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test at fluid management a reporting unit within the company’s dispensing equipment segment fluid management had experienced a downturn in capital spending by its customer base and the loss of market share the company performed an impairment test and compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value it was determined that the fair value of fluid management was less than the carrying value of the net assets the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill the company’s analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 212 million 

 

in october 2008 the date of our annual impairment test the company updated certain forecasts to reflect among other things the global economic downturn and other considerations because of these changes in circumstances as of december 31 2008 the company reassessed the likelihood of any further impairment of our reporting units no goodwill impairments were identified however further changes in our forecasts or changes in key assumptions could cause book values of certain reporting units to exceed their fair values which could have resulted in goodwill impairment charges in future periods except for two of our reporting units within the fluid  metering technologies segment a 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units did not result in goodwill impairment based on carrying values at december 31 2008 the two reporting units which could have potentially resulted in a goodwill impairment if a 10 decrease in fair value were realized had a total goodwill balance of 2042 million

at december 31 2009 the company had one interest rate exchange agreement related to the credit facility the interest rate exchange agreement expiring in january 2011 effectively converted 2500 million of floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt at an interest rate of 325 the fixed rate noted above is comprised of the fixed rate on the interest rate exchange agreement and the company’s current margin of 40 basis points on the credit facility 

 

there are two financial covenants that the company is required to maintain in connection with the credit facility and term loan as defined in the agreement the minimum interest coverage ratio operating cash flow to 

interest is 30 to 1 and the maximum leverage ratio outstanding debt to operating cash flow is 325 to 1 at december 31 2009 the company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants 

 

on april 18 2008 the company completed a 1000 million unsecured senior bank term loan agreement “term loan” with covenants consistent with the existing credit facility and a maturity on december 21 2011 at december 31 2009 there was 950 million outstanding under the term loan with 50 million included within short term borrowings interest under the term loan is based on the bank agent’s reference rate or libor plus an applicable margin and is payable at the end of the selected interest period but at least quarterly the applicable margin is based on the company’s senior unsecured longterm debt rating and can range from 45 to 100 basis points based on the company’s current debt rating the applicable margin is 80 basis points the term loan requires repayments of 50 million and 75 million in april of 2010 and 2011 respectively with the remaining balance due on december 21 2011 the company used the proceeds from the term loan to pay down existing debt outstanding under the credit facility the company currently maintains an interest rate exchange agreement related to the term loan which expires in december 2011 with a current notional amount of 950 million the agreement effectively converted 1000 million of floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt at an interest rate of 400 the fixed rate is comprised of the fixed rate on the interest rate exchange agreement and the company’s current margin of 80 basis points on the term loan 

 

on april 21 2008 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1250 million of its outstanding common shares repurchases under the new program will be funded with cash flow generation and made from time to time in either the open market or through private transactions the timing volume and nature of share repurchases will be at the discretion of management dependent on market conditions other priorities for cash investment applicable securities laws and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time in 2008 23 million shares were purchased at a cost of 500 million no shares were purchased in 2009 

 

despite the downturn in global financial markets during 2008 and 2009 the company has not experienced any liquidity issues and we continue to expect that our current liquidity notwithstanding these adverse market conditions will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements interest on all borrowings required debt repayments any authorized share repurchases planned capital expenditures and annual dividend payments to holders of common stock during the next twelve months in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon terms acceptable to the board of directors we may obtain all or a portion of the financing for the acquisitions through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings however in light of recent adverse events in global financial and economic conditions we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms if at all 

 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans rental payments under operating leases payments under capital leases and other longterm obligations arising in the ordinary course of business there are no identifiable events or uncertainties including the lowering of our credit rating that would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2009 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings additional detail 

regarding these obligations is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data as referenced in the table 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies 

 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 9856525 “revenue recognitionmultipleelement arrangementsrecognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the fair value of each accounting unit revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

 

sharebased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of asc topic 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and 

applies the binomial lattice optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options the binomial lattice optionpricing model incorporates certain assumptions such as the expected volatility riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected forfeiture rate and expected life of options in order to arrive at a fair value estimate as a result sharebased compensation expense as calculated and recorded under asc 718 could have been impacted if other assumptions were used furthermore if the company used different assumptions in future periods sharebased compensation expense could be impacted in future periods see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

 

inventory  — the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market cost which includes material labor and factory overhead is determined on a fifo basis we changed our method of accounting for inventory from the lifo method to the fifo method effective january 1 2009 and applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand product life cycle and engineering changes 

 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets 

 

the company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually on october 31st or more frequently if triggering events occur the company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists 

 

the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach discounted cash flows weighted 50 and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company ebitda multiples methodology weighted 50 to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations 

 

the key assumptions are updated each year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results annual operating plans strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital comparable transactions market data and ebitda multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital the ebitda multiples and terminal growth rates the 2009 and 2008 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows 

 

 

 

the company concluded that the fair value of each of its reporting units was in excess of its carrying value as of october 31 2009 and thus no goodwill impairment was identified however a 10 decrease in fair value of the 

banjo or the water reporting units within the fluid  metering technologies segment could potentially result in a goodwill impairment charge at these reporting units the total goodwill balance for these two reporting units as of october 31 2009 was 2887 million 

 

income taxes  — the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 — “income taxes” under asc 740 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

 

contingencies and litigation — we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and as required and where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we may from time to time enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange agreements on our debt when we believe there is a financial advantage in doing so a treasury risk management policy adopted by the board of directors describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps under the policy we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers typically the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange agreements on the company’s outstanding longterm debt the company’s exposure related to derivative instruments is in the aggregate not material to its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing our customers in the same currency as the source of our products the effect of transaction gains and losses is reported within “other incomenet” on the consolidated statements of operations 

 

the company’s interest rate exposure is primarily related to the 4001 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2009 the majority of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market in order to mitigate this interest exposure the company entered into interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted 3450 million of our floatingrate debt outstanding at december 31 2009 to a fixedrate a 50basis point movement in the interest rate on the remaining 551 million floatingrate debt would result in an approximate 03 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

the recent financial crisis and current uncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit equity and fixed income markets there could be a number of followon effects from these economic developments on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies decreased customer confidence and decreased customer demand including order delays or cancellations 

 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

 

in 2008 53 of the company’s revenue was derived from domestic operations while 47 was international the company’s largest markets include life sciences  medical technologies fire and rescue petroleum lpg paint and coatings chemical processing and water  wastewater treatment a slowdown in the economy and in particular any of these specific end markets could directly affect the company’s revenue stream and profitability 

 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

 

in 2008 approximately 47 of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to earnings for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include the following 

 

• possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations 

 

• risks of economic instability 

 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation 

 

• potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies 

 

• the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances 

 

• changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements and 

 

• insurrection or war 

 

we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on the company’s operations 

an inability to continue to develop new products can limit the company’s revenue and profitability 

 

the company’s organic growth was flat in 2008 and 6 in 2007 approximately 14 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our ability to continue to develop new products 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

 

our historical growth has included and our future growth is likely to continue to include in large part our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations 

 

we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot be assured however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing which may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure you that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

 

the markets we serve are highly competitive this competition could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins 

 

most of our products are sold in competitive markets we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality price design and engineering capabilities product development conformity to customer specifications quality of postsale support timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of our distribution channels maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we cannot be assured that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive we cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials parts and components used in our products 

 

while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro canadian dollar british pound and chinese renminbi any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

an unfavorable outcome with regards to any of our pending contingencies or litigation could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we currently are involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings for additional detail related to this risk see item 3 legal proceedings 

 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

 

our profitability may be adversely affected during any period of an unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates the company’s interest rate exposure was primarily related to the 5540 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2008 the majority of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market in order to mitigate this interest exposure the company entered into interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted 3500 million of our floatingrate debt to a fixed rate a 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the remaining 2040 million floatingrate debt would result in an approximate 10 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flow for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

our intangible assets are a significant portion of our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets could cause a major impact on the company’s net worth 

 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december 31 2008 goodwill and intangible assets totaled 11671 million and 3032 million respectively these intangible assets and goodwill result from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible assets we have acquired annually or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets or goodwill if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for an impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of the intangible assets or goodwill could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and total capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 142 the company concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed in 2008 which required the company to record a goodwill impairment of 301 million at fluid management americas a reporting unit within the company’s dispensing equipment segment see note 4 in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets

in 2006 the company sold lubriquip its lubricant dispensing business that operated as part of the company’s dispensing equipment segment in 2007 the company sold halox its chemical and electrochemical systems 

product line operating as part of pulsafeeder in the company’s fluid  metering technologies segment financial information for 2006 and 2007 has been restated to present the operating results of lubriquip and halox as discontinued operations 

 

performance in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

sales in 2008 of 14895 million were 10 higher than the 13586 million recorded a year ago seven acquisitions quadro — june 2007 isolation technologies — october 2007 ads — january 2008 richter — october 2008 ipek — october 2008 ietg — october 2008 and semrock — october 2008 made since 2007 accounted for an improvement of 9 foreign currency translation accounted for 1 while organic sales were flat organic sales increased in the fluid  metering technologies and fire  safetydiversified products segments but were down in the health  science technologies and dispensing equipment segments domestic organic sales were down 3 versus the prior year while international organic sales were up 4 over the prior year sales to customers outside the us represented 47 of total sales in 2008 and 46 in 2007 

 

in 2008 fluid  metering technologies contributed 47 of sales and 51 of operating income health  science technologies accounted for 22 of sales and 24 of operating income dispensing equipment accounted for 11 of sales and 4 of operating income and fire  safetydiversified products represented 20 of sales and 29 of operating income 

 

fluid  metering technologies sales of 6977 million in 2008 rose 1274 million or 22 compared with 2007 the acquisition of quadro ads richter ipek and ietg accounted for 18 of the increase while organic growth increased 4 in 2008 organic sales grew approximately 2 domestically and 6 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 41 of total segment sales in 2008 and 42 in 2007 

 

health  science technologies sales of 3316 million increased 44 million or 1 in 2008 compared with last year the acquisition of isolation technologies and semrock accounted for 4 of the increase partially offset by a 3 decrease in organic volume in 2008 organic sales decreased 2 domestically and 5 internationally sales to customers outside the us were approximately 39 of total segment sales in 2008 and 2007 

 

dispensing equipment sales of 1639 million decreased 141 million or 8 in 2008 compared with the prior year organic sales decreased 13 while foreign currency translation accounted for an increase of 5 organic domestic sales decreased 35 compared with 2007 while organic international sales were essentially flat sales to customers outside the us were 74 of total segment sales in 2008 up from 63 in 2007 

 

fire  safetydiversified products sales of 3005 million increased 120 million or 4 in 2008 compared with 2007 organic sales activity increased 3 while foreign currency translation accounted for 1 in 2008 organic sales decreased 4 domestically while organic international sales increased 11 sales to customers outside the us were 54 of total segment sales in 2008 and 49 in 2007 

 

gross profit of 6039 million in 2008 was 355 million or 6 higher than 2007 as a percent of sales gross profit was 405 in 2008 which represented a 130 basispoint decrease from 418 in 2007 the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects product mix higher material costs and the effect from recent acquisitions 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased to 3434 million in 2008 from 3134 million in 2007 this increase primarily relates to our recent acquisitions as a percent of net sales sga expenses were 230 for both 2008 and 2007 

 

in 2008 the company recorded pretax restructuring expenses totaling 180 million these restructuring expenses were related to the company’s restructuring program to support the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed to achieve longterm sustainable growth which includes the previously announced cessation of manufacturing operations in its dispensing equipment segment’s milan italy facility the plant closure is expected to improve operating productivity and enhance capacity utilization the company has substantially completed companywide plans which include management and administrative workforce reductions as well as an additional facility consolidation employees separated or to be separated from the company as a result of these initiatives were offered severance packages as appropriate the expenses recorded in 2008 included costs related to involuntary terminations and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives 

in 2008 in accordance with sfas no 142 the company concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed which required the company to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test at fluid management americas a reporting unit within the company’s dispensing equipment segment fluid management americas has experienced a downturn in capital spending by its customer base and the loss of market share as a result the company performed an impairment test and compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value it was determined that the fair value of fluid management americas was less than the carrying value of the net assets the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities was the implied fair value of goodwill the company’s analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 212 million and as a result the company recognized an impairment charge of 301 million in 2008 

 

since october 31 2008 the date of our annual impairment test the company has updated certain forecasts to reflect among other things the global economic downturn and other considerations because of these changes in circumstances as of december 31 2008 the company has reassessed the likelihood of any further impairment of our reporting units no goodwill impairments were identified however further changes in our forecasts or changes in key assumptions could cause book values of certain reporting units to exceed their fair values which would potentially result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods except for two of our reporting units within the fluid  metering technologies segment a 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not result in goodwill impairment based on carrying values at december 31 2008 the two reporting units which could potentially result in a goodwill impairment if a 10 decrease in fair value were realized have a total goodwill balance of 2042 million 

 

operating income decreased 427 million or 17 to 2124 million in 2008 from the 2551 million in 2007 this decrease was primarily due to the 180 million of restructuringrelated charges and 301 million for the goodwill impairment charge offset by a net amount of 54 million related to the favorable effect of 2008 acquisitions and other inflationary increases in costs operating margins in 2008 were 143 of sales compared with 188 in 2007 the decrease in operating margins was primarily due to the impact of the previously announced restructuringrelated and goodwill impairment charges as well as expenses associated with recent acquisitions partially offset by an increase in volume 

 

in the fluid  metering technologies segment operating income of 1294 million in 2008 was up from the 1214 million recorded in 2007 principally due to increased volume partially offset by the restructuringrelated charges operating margins for fluid  metering technologies of 185 in 2008 were down from 213 in 2007 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and the restructuringrelated charges in the health  science technologies segment operating income of 597 million and operating margins of 180 in 2008 were down from the 609 million and 186 recorded in 2007 principally due to recent acquisitions and the restructuringrelated charges in the dispensing equipment segment an operating loss of 106 million and operating margins of 65 in 2008 were down from the 394 million and 221 recorded in 2007 due to lower volume as a result of continued deterioration in capital spending for both north american and european markets the restructuringrelated and goodwill impairment charges and selective material cost increases operating income and operating margins in the fire  safetydiversified products segment of 737 million and 245 respectively were higher than the 665 million and 231 recorded in 2007 due primarily to favorable product mix partially offset by restructuringrelated charges

despite the current downturn in global financial markets the company has not experienced any liquidity issues and we continue to expect that our current liquidity notwithstanding these adverse market conditions will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements interest on all borrowings required debt repayments any authorized share repurchases planned capital expenditures and annual dividend payments to holders of common stock during the next twelve months in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon terms acceptable to the board of directors we may obtain all or a portion of the financing for the acquisitions through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings however in light of recent adverse events in global financial and economic conditions we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms if at all 

 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies 

 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of all of our accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

revenue recognition  — the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including the combination of products and services in such cases the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the fair value of each accounting unit revenues from certain longterm contracts are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted longterm contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is reasonably possible that completion costs including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements will be revised in the nearterm such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 

 

the company records allowances for discounts product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company 

 

sharebased compensation  — the company adopted sfas no 123r “share based payment” effective january 1 2006 and applies the binomial lattice optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options the binomial lattice optionpricing model incorporates certain assumptions such as the expected volatility riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield and expected life of options in order to arrive at a fair value estimate as a result sharebased compensation expense as calculated and recorded under sfas no 123r could have been 

impacted if other assumptions were used furthermore if the company used different assumptions in future periods sharebased compensation expense could be impacted in future periods see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

 

inventory  — the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market cost includes material labor and overhead and is determined by the lastin firstout basis or firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required at the business unit level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand product life cycle and engineering changes 

 

goodwill longlived and intangible assets  — the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes an impairment of a longlived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations an intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value assessments of possible impairments of goodwill longlived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations additionally testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances is performed annually the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets 

 

income taxes  — the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws the company’s tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 

 

contingencies and litigation — we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and as required and where it is reasonably possible to do so we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

 

defined benefit retirement plans  — the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using market quotations plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts results could be adversely affected 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 141r revised 2007 “business combinations” which replaces sfas no 141 sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any controlling interest recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 the company will adopt this statement for acquisitions consummated after its effective date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity it also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires expanded disclosures sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

in february 2008 fasb issued a fasb staff position “fsp” to allow a oneyear deferral of adoption of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis the company will adopt the fsp on january 1 2009 and we expect the adoption to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment to fasb statement no 133” sfas no 161 is intended to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 with early adoption encouraged the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 161 on its financial statements 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” fsp no 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fsp no 1423 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp eitf no 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” under eitf no 0361 unvested sharebased payment awards that contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and should be included in the twoclass method of computing eps eitf no 0361 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years the company is currently evaluating the impact of eitf no 0361 on its financial statements 

 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” fsp no 1573 clarifies the application of sfas no 157 which the company adopted as of january 1 2008 in cases where a market is not active the company has considered the guidance provided by fsp no 1573 in its determination of estimated fair values as of december 31 2008 and the impact was not material

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we may from time to time enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange agreements on our debt when we believe there is a financial advantage in doing so a treasury risk management policy adopted by the board of directors describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange agreements under the policy we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers typically the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange agreements on the company’s outstanding longterm debt the company’s exposure related to derivative instruments is in the aggregate not material to its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the euro british pound canadian dollar and chinese renminbi we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing our customers in the same currency as the source of our products the effect of transaction gains and losses is reported within “other incomenet” on the consolidated statements of operations at december 31 2008 the company had foreign currency contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 134 million 

 

the company’s interest rate exposure was primarily related to the 5540 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2008 the majority of the debt was priced at interest rates that float with the market in order to mitigate this interest exposure the company entered into interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted 3500 million of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate a 50basis point movement in the interest rate on the remaining 2040 million floatingrate debt would result in an approximate 10 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows

item 1a risk factors

for an enterprise as diverse and complex as the company a wide range of factors
could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the
factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the
description of these operations and the financial results of these operations
elsewhere in this report the most significant factors affecting our operations
include the following

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the
profitability of any of our businesses

     in 2005 57 of the companys revenue was derived from domestic operations
while 43 was international the companys largest markets include paint and
coatings fire and rescue machinery life sciences and medical chemical
processing and petroleumlpg a slowdown in the economy and specifically any of
these specific end markets could directly affect the companys revenue stream
and profitability

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely
affect us

     in the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 43 of our total sales
were to customers outside the us we expect international operations and export
sales to continue to contribute to earnings for the foreseeable future both the
sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying
degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such
risks include the following

         possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country
          laws or regulations

         risks of economic instability

         currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency
          repatriation

         potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies

         the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances

         changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing
          requirements

         insurrection or war

we cannot assure you of the impact on us if such events occur in the future

innovation is a big driver of our revenue growth an inability to continue to
develop new products can limit the companys revenue and profitability

     the companys organic growth in 2005 and 2004 was 10 and 7 respectively
more than 20 of our revenue was derived from new products developed over the
past three years our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our
ability to continue to develop new products

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make
acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully

     our historical growth has also depended and our future growth is likely to
continue to depend in large part on our acquisition strategy and the successful
integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to
continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new
markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we
cannot assure you


                                                                               6

however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates
negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing which may be needed to
consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully
integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new
markets in addition we cannot assure you that any acquisition once
successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or
prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow

     acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the
assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the
acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other
business concerns in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future
acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional
indebtedness and other expenses once integrated acquired operations may not
achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those
achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected

the markets we serve are highly competitive this competition could limit the
volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins

     most of our products are sold in competitive markets we believe that the
principal points of competition in our markets are product quality price
design and engineering capabilities product development conformity to customer
specifications quality of postsale support timeliness of delivery and
effectiveness of our distribution channels maintaining and improving our
competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing
engineering quality standards marketing customer service and support and our
distribution networks we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that
are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and
effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to
new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures could also
cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive we
cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing
competitors or with new competitors failure to continue competing successfully
could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of
operations

we are dependent on the availability of raw materials and parts and components
used in our products

     while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products
we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and
components from suppliers the availability and prices from materials and parts
and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other
things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production
by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels any change
in the supply of or price for these raw materials or parts and components
could materially affect our business financial condition and results of
operations

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial
results

     we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
particularly with respect to the euro and the british pound any significant
change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business
against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively
and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on
our business financial condition and results of operations the impact from
these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to a certain extent
lessoned through invoicing our customers in the same currency as the source of
the products for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

an unfavorable outcome with regards to any of our pending contingencies or
litigation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results
of operations

     we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and
as required and where it is reasonably possible to do so have accrued our
estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters these
estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based
upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and
settlement strategies it is possible however that future operating results
for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by
changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to
these proceedings


                                                                               7

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates

     our profitability may also be adversely affected during any period of
unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates at december 31 2005 we had
1600 million of total debt outstanding of which approximately 6 was priced
at interest rates that float with the market a 50 basis point increase in the
interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximate 50200
annualized increase in interest expense and decrease in cash flows
historically we have maintained a higher level of debt on our balance sheet a
higher level of debt would obviously increase the exposure discussed above for
additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and
qualitative disclosure about market risk

our intangible assets are a significant portion of our total assets and a
writeoff of our intangible assets could cause a major impact on the companys
net worth

     our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill
at december 31 2005 goodwill totaled 6919 million the goodwill results from
our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the
tangible assets we have acquired at each balance sheet date we assess whether
there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future
operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall
significantly below current levels we could reflect under current applicable
accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill
impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion
of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of
operations and total capitalization which effect could be material as of
december 31 2005 we have determined that no impairment existed

our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective
bargaining agreements

     as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 4300 employees
approximately 11 of our employees are represented by unions with various
contracts expiring through november 2008 we cannot assure you that we will be
successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such
negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or
that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our
operations in addition our closures of certain facilities may create the risk
of strikes or work stoppages at those and other facilities



item 1b unresolved staff comments

the company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current
reports from the staff of the securities and exchange commission that were
issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2005 calendar year and that
remain unresolved



item 2 properties

     the companys principal plants and offices have an aggregate floor space
area of approximately 32 million square feet of which 22 million square feet
70 are located in the us and approximately 10 million square feet 30
are located outside the us primarily in italy 7 the uk 6 germany
6 and the netherlands 4 these facilities are considered to be suitable
and adequate for their operations management believes that utilization of
manufacturing capacity ranges from 40 to 70 in each facility the companys

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

historical overview and outlook

     idex sells a broad range of proprietary pumps metering devices dispensing
equipment and other engineered products to a diverse customer base in the united
states and internationally accordingly idexs businesses are affected by
levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the us and in other
countries where its products are sold and by the relationship of the us
dollar to other currencies among the factors that influence the demand for
idexs products are interest rates levels of capacity utilization and capital
spending in certain industries and overall industrial activity

     idex has a history of aboveaverage operating margins the companys
operating margins are affected by among other things utilization of facilities
as sales volumes change and including newly acquired businesses which may have
lower margins and whose margins are normally further reduced by purchase
accounting adjustments

     beginning in 2002 purchase accounting adjustments will not significantly
affect idexs margins since the company will no longer amortize goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives to earnings in accordance with new
accounting rules instead idex will periodically review these assets for
impairment as explained under the new accounting pronouncement section on page
21

     for 2001 idex reported record orders and sales while recording lower net
income and earnings per share compared with the prior year new orders in 2001
totaled 7134 million 2 above the prior year excluding the impact of foreign
currency and the five acquisitions made since the beginning of 2000
ismatec  april 2000 trebor  may 2000 class 1  january 2001 liquid
controls  january 2001 and versamatic  june 2001 orders were 9 lower
than 2000 the companys order declines were associated with the weaknesses in
the north american and european manufacturing sectors and the aftermath of the
september 11 terrorist attacks at december 31 2001 idex had an unfilled order
backlog of slightly over one months sales consistent with recent periods

     the year 2001 was a very difficult one for the country and for idex as a
manufacturer of industrial products the slowdown in idexs business that
started in the second half of 2000 lingered into the first half of 2001 and
then deteriorated further in the third quarter even before the tragic events of
september 11 business activity levels for the fourth quarter dropped even more
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks and the onset of the war against
terrorism in 2001 idex wrote 190 million of orders in the first quarter 191
million in the second 171 million in the third and only 161 million in the
last quarter since idex operates with a very small backlog of unfilled orders
reductions in order activity very quickly will reduce sales and profitability

     these order declines were associated with continuing weaknesses in
virtually all worldwide manufacturing sectors the most significant impact has
been felt in the dispensing equipment group  which serves the paints and
coatings automotive and general industrial markets  where sales comparisons
with the prior year were down 27 for the fourth quarter and 17 for the full
year all three businesses in this group were affected as fourth quarter
operations were below breakeven levels and fullyear profits were down 57 from
2000

     as a direct result of the depressed business environment the companys
management took aggressive actions in the first and fourth quarters to further
downsize operations to be consistent with reduced business

                                        1

activity levels a total restructuring charge of 112 million 71 million
after tax or 23 cents per diluted share was taken that affected all three
business groups during the year the workforce at idex was reduced by 15
percent affecting almost 600 employees these actions were necessary to
appropriately size idexs businesses lower costs and improve efficiencies the
annual savings from these actions will exceed the total charge recorded despite
the very difficult economic environment idex continued to generate excellent
cash flow the companys free cash flow cash flow from operations minus capital
expenditures has exceeded net income every year since idex was formed in 1988
free cash flow in 2001 was a record 86 million which was more than double its
net income before restructuring

     looking ahead to 2002 the companys performance will depend on the pace of
incoming business it is exceedingly difficult to project what orders will be
given the current economic and political environment idex operates with a very
small backlog of unfilled orders and it is not able to assess how long the
softness in several of its endmarkets is likely to last the companys
performance will depend upon the strength of the us and key international
economies the company believes idex is well positioned for a strong recovery
once economic conditions improve this is based on its reduced cost structures
the margin improvement initiatives of six sigma global sourcing and ebusiness
and the use of strong cash flow to cut debt and interest expense in addition
idex continues to pursue acquisitions to drive its longer term profitable
growth

cautionary statement under the private securities litigation reform act

     the historical overview and outlook and the liquidity and capital
resources sections of this managements discussion and analysis of idexs
financial condition and results of operations contain forwardlooking statements
within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act and section 21e of the
exchange act these statements relate to among other things capital
expenditures cost reduction cash flow and operating improvements and are
indicated by words such as anticipate estimate expects plans
projects should will management believes the company intends and
similar words or phrases the statements are subject to inherent uncertainties
and risks that could cause actual results to vary materially from suggested
results including but not limited to the following economic and political
consequences resulting from the september 11 2001 terrorist actions levels of
industrial activity and economic conditions in the us and other countries
around the world pricing pressures and other competitive factors and levels of
capital spending in certain industries all of which could have a material
impact on order rates and the companys results particularly in light of the
low levels of order backlogs it typically maintains idexs ability to integrate
and operate acquired businesses on a profitable basis the relationship of the
us dollar to other currencies and its impact on pricing and cost
competitiveness interest rates utilization of idexs capacity and the affect
of capacity utilization on costs labor market conditions and raw material
costs developments with respect to contingencies such as litigation and
environmental matters and other risks detailed from time to time in the
companys filings with the securities and exchange commission

     investors also should be aware that while idex does from time to time
communicate with securities analysts it is against idexs policy to disclose to
them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial
information accordingly shareholders should not assume that idex agrees with
any statement or report issued by any analyst regardless of the content of the
statement or report in addition idex has a policy against issuing or
confirming their financial forecasts projections or opinions and these reports
are not developed by nor are they the responsibility of idex

earnings per share in 2001 compared with the prior year new orders in 2001
totaled 7134 million and were 2 above the prior year excluding the impact of
foreign currency and the five acquisitions made since the beginning of 2000
orders were 9 lower

     sales for 2001 increased by 3 to 7269 million from 7043 million
acquisitions accounted for a 13 improvement which was partially offset by a 9
decline in base business sales and a 1 unfavorable currency translation net
income was 327 million which was 48 lower than the 634 million earned in
2000 diluted earnings per share decreased by 102 to 105 down 49 compared

attributable to significantly lower base business sales volumes production
inefficiencies and underabsorption of manufacturing expenses related to lower
volumes and planned inventory reductions and the addition of lower margin
acquisitions selling general and administrative sga expenses increased to
1649 million in 2001 from 1496 million in 2000 due to including

efficiencies and addressed excess capacity that resulted from lower demand and
more efficient processes at the gast and hale business units

     interest expense increased to 207 million in 2001 from 165 million in

376 million in 2000 reflecting lower income the effective tax rate increased

liquidity and capital resources

     at december 31 2001 idexs working capital was 1276 million and its
current ratio was 25 to 1 the companys cash flow provided from operations
increased by 146 million to 1073 million in 2001 principally due to
reductions in receivables and inventories which were partially offset by lower
income

     cash flow from operations was more than adequate to fund capital
expenditures of 216 million 207 million and 183 million in 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively capital expenditures generally were used for machinery and
equipment to improve productivity although a portion was for business system
technology and for repair and replacement of equipment and facilities
management believes that idex has ample capacity in its plant and equipment to
meet expected needs for future growth in the intermediate term

     the company completed the acquisitions of liquid controls class 1 and
versamatic during 2001 for a cash purchase price of 1323 million the
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method and were financed
under the companys us bank credit facilities

     during june 2001 idex signed a new fiveyear multicurrency credit
agreement replacing the former credit facility which was to expire on july 1
2001 and the german facility which was to expire on november 1 2001 at
december 31 2001 the maximum amount available under the credit agreement was
300 million of which 1123 million was borrowed including 593 million in
western european currencies these borrowings provide an economic hedge against
the net investment in the four operations located in europe interest is payable
quarterly on the outstanding balance at the agent banks reference rate or at
libor plus an applicable margin and a utilization fee if the total borrowings
exceed certain levels the applicable margin is based on idexs debt rating and
can range from 25 basis points to 100 basis points the utilization fee can
range from zero to 25 basis points at december 31 2001 the applicable margin
was 80 basis points plus a utilization fee of 125 basis points since the
borrowings exceeded 33 of the total available the company pays an annual fee
of 20 basis points on the total facility

     the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an agreement in
december 2001 with a financial institution under which it collateralized certain
receivables for the borrowings receivables facility the receivables facility
provides for borrowings of up to 50 million depending upon the level of
eligible receivables at december 31 2001 25 million was borrowed and
included in longterm debt at an annual interest rate of approximately 34

     the company has a 20 million demand line of credit shortterm facility
which expires december 1 2002 borrowings under the shortterm facility are at
the banks reference rate or based on libor plus 80 basis points per annum at
december 31 2001 there were no borrowings under the shortterm facility

     idex believes it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2002
to meet its operating requirements interest on all borrowings outstanding in
longterm debt any authorized share repurchases restructuring expenses
approximately 27 million of planned capital expenditures and 17 million of

dividend payments to holders of common stock since it began operations in
january 1988 through december 31 2001 idex has borrowed 809 million under its
various credit agreements to complete 19 acquisitions during this period idex
generated principally from operations cash flow of 682 million to reduce its
indebtedness in the event that suitable businesses are available for
acquisition upon terms acceptable to the board of directors idex may obtain all
or a portion of the financing for the acquisitions through incurring additional
longterm debt the credit agreement contains a covenant that limits total debt
outstanding to threetimes operating cash flow at december 31 2001 idex was
limited to 377 million of total debt outstanding idexs contractual
obligations and commercial commitments include rental payments under operating
leases payments under capital leases longterm debt obligations and other
longterm obligations arising in the ordinary course of business the company
has no offbalance sheet arrangements or material longterm purchase
obligations there are no identifiable events or uncertainties including the
lowering of idexs credit rating that would accelerate payment or maturity of

     idex historically accounted for all business combinations using the
purchase method and will continue to use this method for all prospective
business combinations at december 31 2001 goodwill totaled 4546 million
which is subject to periodic review for impairment under sfas no 142 after
reviewing the estimated fair market values both in the aggregate and at
individual business units idex recorded no impairment to goodwill on january 1
2002 if future operating performance at its business units would fall
significantly below current levels the company would reflect a noncash charge
for goodwill impairment to its results of operations in that period

     the pronouncement also requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets
with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings had the new accounting
pronouncement been adopted on january 1 2001 idexs reported diluted earnings
per share in 2001 would have increased by 37 from 105 to 142

euro preparations

     beginning in 1998 the company upgraded its business systems to accommodate
the euro currency the cost of this upgrade was immaterial to the companys
financial results although difficult to predict any competitive implications
and any impact on existing financial instruments resulting from the euro
implementation also are expected to be immaterial to the companys results of
operations financial position or liquidity



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates interest rate exposure is limited to
the 2918 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2001 approximately
47 of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market a 50
basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result
in an approximate 686000 annualized increase or decrease in interest expense
and cash flows the remaining debt is fixed rate debt the company will from
time to time enter into interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there
is a clear financial advantage for doing so a treasury risk management policy
adopted by the board of directors describes the procedures and controls over
derivative financial and commodity instruments including interest rate swaps
under the policy the company does not use derivative financial or commodity
instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to
strict approvals by senior officers typically the use of derivative
instruments is limited to interest rate swaps on the companys outstanding
longterm debt idexs exposure related to derivative instruments is in the
aggregate not material to its financial position results of operations and
cash flows

     the companys foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to
the euro and british pound idex manages its foreign exchange risk principally
through invoicing its customers in the same currency as the source of the
products
