covid19 impact and response 

since its outbreak in early calendar 2020 covid19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in 

march 2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work offsite and we suspended all nonessential business travel as of august 15 2022 the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity we have announced that our official returntooffice date is september 6 2022 though employees have been permitted to voluntarily return to the office since may 2 2022 individual decisions on returning to the office will be managercoordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments a large number of our employees have requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and inperson working while our business travel is normalizing we do not expect it to return to prepandemic levels and continue to encourage a cautious approach to business travel activities 

customers 

we work closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the covid19 pandemic even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been limited we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2022 and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak including the onset of variants of the virus the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants the development and effectiveness of treatments the effect on the economy generally the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees and how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing and installationrelated revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k

business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

• providing commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality and support onpremise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality 

• expanding each core customer relationship by crossselling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems 

• providing noncore highly specialized coreagnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions including institutions not utilizing a jkhy core operating system and diverse corporate entities 

• maintaining a companywide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention 

• capitalizing on our acquisition strategy 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 34 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

• expand our suite of complementary products and services 

• provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and noncore customers and outside our base to new customers andor 

• provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry 

after 46 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our stockholders while we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our stockholders such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired 

business and operating risks 

data security breaches failures or other incidents could damage our reputation and business our business relies upon receiving processing storing and transmitting sensitive information relating to our operations employees and customers if we fail to maintain a sufficient digital security infrastructure address security vulnerabilities and new threats or deploy adequate technologies to secure our systems against attack we may be subject to security breaches that compromise confidential information adversely affect our ability to operate our business damage our reputation and business adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and expose us to liability we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks systems and data a security failure by one of these third parties could expose our information systems to interruption of operations and security vulnerabilities we also use thirdparty vendors to store and process data for us and they face similar risks our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks or other cyberattacks carried out by cyber criminals or statesponsored actors other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses ransomware or malware cyberattacks and other means which are constantly evolving and difficult to detect although none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations to date we anticipate that attempts to attack our systems services and infrastructure and those of our customers and vendors may grow in frequency and sophistication those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers vendors or other users of our systems through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients 

we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information or that employee corporateowned computers are stolen or customer data media is lost in shipment an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition under state federal and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial although we believe our security controls and infrastructure are adequate to protect our systems and data we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to combat all current and future technological risks and threats advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products the significant amount of capital and other resources we currently expend to protect against the threat of security breaches may prove insufficient to prevent a breach we cannot ensure that any limitationofliability provisions in our customer and user agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors or other contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims relating to a security breach or similar matters the insurance coverage we maintain to address data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise and there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in the event of a security breach we may need to spend substantial additional capital and resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

failure to maintain sufficient technological infrastructure or an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers our products and services require substantial investments in technological infrastructure and we have experienced significant growth in the number of users transactions and data that our technological infrastructure supports if we fail to adequately invest in and support our technological infrastructure and processing capacity we may not be able to support our customers’ processing needs and may be more susceptible to interruptions and delays in services damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment events that could cause operational failures include but are not limited to hardware and software defects breakdowns or malfunctions cybersecurity incidents human error power losses disruptions in telecommunications services computer viruses or other malware or other events our facilities are also subject to physical risks related to natural disasters or severe weather events such as tornados flooding hurricanes and heat waves climate change may increase the likelihood and severity of such events our backup systems and procedures may prove insufficient or otherwise fail to prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services if an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs implementing modifications and upgrades to our technological infrastructure subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing systems policies procedures and monitoring tools 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we direct the settlement of funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments realtime payments through faster payment networks and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions we could suffer financial as well as reputational loss in addition we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services that we cannot provide ourselves if we are unable to obtain such services in the future or if the price of such services becomes unsustainable our business financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may issue shortterm credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement process a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

failures of thirdparty service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss we rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations we also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers as we continue to move more computing storage and processing services out of our data centers and facilities and into thirdparty hosting environments our reliance on these providers and their systems will increase while we have selected these thirdparty vendors carefully we do not control their actions a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to our customers such a failure could lead to damage claims loss of customers and reputational harm depending on the duration and severity of the failure third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as us including but not limited to compliance with applicable laws and regulations hardware and software defects breakdowns or malfunctions cybersecurity incidents human error power losses disruptions in telecommunications services computer viruses or other malware natural disasters or severe weather events or other events one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively our customers could be negatively impacted and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

competition may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or otherwise attract our customers or prevent us from capturing new customers we may need to lower prices or offer other terms that negatively impact our results of operations in order to successfully compete 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of seven or more years we will continue to experience a significant number of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us including reducing the services we provide or negotiating the prices paid for our services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms revenues and profit margins will suffer we may experience increased costs for services from our thirdparty vendors due to inflation or other cost expansion but because our customer contracts typically have longer terms than our vendor contracts our ability to pass on those higher costs to customers may be limited if inflation or costs outpace our contractual ability to adjust pricing during the contractual terms of our customer contracts our revenues and profit margins could be negatively impacted 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

software defects or problems with installations may harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects especially in connection with newly released products and software updates software defects may cause interruptions or delays to our services as we attempt to correct the problem we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our products on systems used by our customers defects in our software installation problems or delays or other difficulties could result in negative publicity loss of revenues loss of competitive position or claims against us by customers in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

regulatory and compliance risks 

the software and services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of software and services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the consumer financial protection bureau and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the way we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable federal and state laws and regulations if we or third parties with whom we contract or partner fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future 

growth or expansion new regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions we will be required to apply substantial research and development and other corporate resources to adapt our products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

compliance with new and existing privacy laws regulations and rules may adversely impact our expenses development and strategy we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity if we fail to comply with such requirements we could be subject to reputational harm regulatory enforcement and litigation the use confidentiality and security of private customer information is under increased scrutiny regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cybersecurity program along with other compliance requirements and the california consumer privacy act the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies have created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all the mandates in an efficient manner and may increase costs to deliver affected products and services as those requirements are established 

failure to comply or readily address compliance and regulatory rule changes made by payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network compliance rules governing the payment networks we serve including visa mastercard zelle and the clearing house’s rtp network and all rules governing the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules and standards we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations changes made by the networks even when complied with may result in reduction in revenues and increased costs of operations 

economic conditions risks 

a widespread public health crisis could adversely affect our results of operations the widespread outbreak of a communicable illness or disease such as the covid19 outbreak or other public health crises including government mandates in response to such events can result in significant economic disruptions and uncertainties and could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the conditions caused by such events may affect the rate of spending by our customers and their ability to pay for our products and services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions interfere with our employees’ ability to support our business function disrupt the ability of thirdparty providers we rely upon to deliver services adversely impact our ability to provide onsite services or installations to our customers or reduce the number of transactions we process all of which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position we are unable to accurately predict the impact of such events on our business due to a number of uncertainties including the duration severity geographic reach and governmental responses to such events the impact on our customers’ and vendors operations and our ability to provide products and services including the impact of our employees working remotely if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business will be harmed 

our business may be adversely impacted by general us and global market and economic conditions or specific conditions in the financial services industry we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the general economic environment worsens or if conditions or regulatory requirements within the financial services industry change such as if financial institutions are required to increase reserve amounts customers may be less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services and we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending resulting in reduced transaction volumes and our related revenues 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 4790 commercial and savings banks and more than 5000 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions in the united states has experienced a steady decrease over recent decades due to mergers and acquisitions and financial failures and we expect this trend to continue as more consolidation occurs such events may reduce the number of our current and potential customers which could negatively impact our results of operations 

acquisition risks 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

acquisitions subject us to risks and may be costly and difficult to integrate on august 5 2022 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire 100 of the equity interests of payrailz llc which offers digital payment capabilities including realtime persontoperson p2p payments the acquisition is anticipated to close on august 31 2022 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions acquisitions including the payrailz acquisition are difficult to evaluate and our due diligence may not identify all potential liabilities or valuation issues we may also be subject to risks related to cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities of the acquired company and the acquired systems we may not be able to successfully integrate payrailz or any other acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs and liabilities unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance the payrailz acquisition or other future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets 

intellectual property risks 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we also use certain open source software in our products which may subject us to suits by persons claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may adversely affect our competitive position our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary systems and technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or access systems or technology that we consider proprietary we actively take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights including entering into agreements with users of our services for that purpose and maintaining security measures however these steps may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and misappropriation or litigation relating to such matters could have a material negative effect on our results of operation 

general risk factors 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the loss of key employees and difficulties in hiring and retaining employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers further we are facing an increasingly competitive market for hiring and retaining skilled employees which is exacerbated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and increased acceptance of hiring remote working employees by our competitors and other companies difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees may restrict our ability to adequately support our business needs andor result in increased personnel costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to maintain the company’s strategic direction 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2022 on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results 

an increase in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs although our debt borrowing levels have historically been low we may require additional or increased borrowings in the future under existing or new debt facilities to support operations finance acquisitions or fund stock repurchases our current revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate increases in interest rates on variablerate debt would increase our interest expense which could negatively impact our results of operations

covid19 impact and response 

since its outbreak in early calendar 2020 covid19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in march 2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work offsite and we suspended all nonessential business travel as of august 15 2022 the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity we have announced that our official returntooffice date is september 6 2022 though employees have been permitted to voluntarily return to the office since may 2 2022 individual decisions on returning to the office will be managercoordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments a large number of our employees have requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and inperson working while our business travel is normalizing we do not expect it to return to prepandemic levels and continue to encourage a cautious approach to business travel activities 

customers 

we work closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the covid19 pandemic even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been limited we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2022 and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak including the onset of variants of the virus the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants the development and effectiveness of treatments the effect on the economy generally the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees and how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing and installationrelated revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows 

results of operations 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

in fiscal 2022 total revenue increased 11 or 184659 compared to fiscal 2021 reducing total revenue for the effects of deconversion fees of 53279 for the current fiscal year and 20635 for the prior fiscal year and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2022 of 274 and in fiscal 2021 of 1182 results in a 9 increase or 152923 this increase was primarily driven by growth in private and public cloud card processing remittance implementation and transaction and digital revenues partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue compared to the prior fiscal year 

operating expenses increased 8 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher costs related to our card payment processing platform associated with corresponding increases in revenue higher personnel costs increased operating licenses and fees and higher travel expenses 

we move into fiscal 2023 following strong performance in fiscal 2022 significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability efficiency and security we believe our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 follows 

revenue 

services and support includes private and public cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of seven years or greater at inception product delivery and services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses implementation services deconversion fees consulting and hardware and onpremise support revenue which is composed primarily of maintenance fees with annual contract terms 

in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 services and support revenue increased compared to the prior fiscal year reducing total services and support revenue by the effects of deconversion fees for each year which totaled 53279 in fiscal 2022 and 20635 in fiscal 2021 and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2021 of 1181 revenue grew 75 this increase was primarily driven by higher private and public cloud revenue resulting from organic growth in data processing and hosting fee revenue reflecting a continuing shift of customers to our term license model growth in implementation and software usage revenues also contributed to the increase partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue compared to the prior fiscal year 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

processing revenue increased 11 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 with strong organic growth in the card processing transaction and digital and remittance revenue components primarily due to expanding volumes 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue for fiscal 2022 increased 6 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by higher direct costs associated with our card processing platform in line with related revenue increases higher personnel costs and higher operating licenses and fees cost of revenue decreased 2 as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer driven 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2022 increased 11 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher personnel costs net of capitalization research and development expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 the consistency of this expense category for the fiscal years presented reflected our continuing commitment to the development of strategic products 



selling general and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts commissions finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased 17 compared to fiscal 2021 reducing total selling general and administrative expense for the effects of deconversion fees from each year which totaled 2485 in fiscal 2022 and 489 in fiscal 2021 and removing the effects of acquisitions divestitures and gainloss of 29 for the current fiscal year and of 2012 for the prior fiscal year selling general and administrative expense increased 14 compared to fiscal 2021 this increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs increased travel expenses and a smaller gain on sale of assets in the current fiscal year selling general and administrative expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to the timing and amounts of borrowed balances 



the increase in the companys effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of an increase in the state tax rate applied to net deferred tax liabilities and less rate benefit received from research and development credits 



net income grew 17 to 362916 or 494 per diluted share in fiscal 2022 from 311469 or 412 per diluted share in fiscal 2021 the diluted earnings per share increase year over year was 20 growth in net income and 

earnings per share was primarily due to the organic growth in our lines of revenue in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 partially offset by the increase in provision for income taxes

revenue in the corporate and other segment increased 14 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase was mainly due to increased onpremise support and implementation revenues

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in december 2019 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201912 income taxes topic 740 simplifying the accounting for income taxes which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of topic 740 guidance the asu was effective for the company on july 1 2021 the company adopted asu 201912 effective july 1 2021 with no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements 

not adopted at fiscal year end 

in october 2021 the fasb issued asu no 202108 business combinations topic 805 accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company plans to adopt the asu effective july 1 2023 and will apply it prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after that date 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from data processing transaction processing software licensing and related services professional services and hardware sales 

significant judgments in application of the guidance 

identification of performance obligations 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  that is if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer 

determination of transaction price 

the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer our contracts with our customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration we estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method based on both historical and current information where appropriate we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are longterm and include uncertain transactional volumes 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer this assessment is made at the performance obligation level 

allocation of transaction price 

the transaction price once determined is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices the standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available including reference to historical pricing data 

contract costs 

we incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered these costs consist primarily of sales commissions which are incurred only if a contract is obtained and customer conversion or implementationrelated costs 

capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results for longlived assets we consider whether any impairment indicators are present if impairment indicators are identified we test the recoverability of the longlived assets if this recoverability test is failed we determine the fair value of the longlived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than its carrying value 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant areas of judgment include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments include a qualitative assessment of factors that may indicate a potential for impairment such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market changes our overall financial performance changes in share price and an assessment of other events or changes in circumstances that could negatively impact us if that qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative assessment is then required including an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates our most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have 115 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2022 and a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by 115 million

covid19 impact and response 

since its outbreak in early 2020 covid19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in march 

2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work offsite and we suspended all nonessential business travel this companywide recommendation extended until july 1 2021 at which point we began transition to a return to our facilities and normalization of travel activities individual decisions on returning to the office were managercoordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments a large number of our employees requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and inperson working we have not required employees who return to our facilities to receive vaccinations but we have provided information on vaccine providers as well as hosted onsite covid19 vaccination clinics at several of our facilities for our employees and their families on august 3 2021 we reimplemented our companywide recommendation for remote work and are encouraging a cautious approach to business travel based on the spread of the delta variant and increased infection rates for those employees who are at our facilities we have introduced enhanced sanitation procedures and we require face masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees as of august 13 2021 the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity 

customers 

we work closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the covid19 pandemic even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been curtailed we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2021 and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak including the onset of variants of the virus the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments the speed of economic recovery the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees and how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing and installationrelated revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k

mission statement 

our mission is to provide quality solutions and industryleading service to our customers while fostering our culture that is personally professionally and financially rewarding to our employees and increasing the value of our stockholders investments 

business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

• providing commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality and support onpremise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality 

• expanding each core customer relationship by crossselling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems 

• providing highly specialized core agnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions including institutions not utilizing a jack henry core operating system and diverse corporate entities 

• maintaining a companywide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention 

• capitalizing on our acquisition strategy 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 34 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

• expand our suite of complementary products and services 

• provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and noncore customers and outside our base to new customers andor 

• provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry 

we have completed three acquisitions in the last 3 years after 45 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders while we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by onpremise installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by leveraging our private cloud environment for those functions our core private cloud services are provided through a highly resilient data center configuration across multiple physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for seven or more years that include per account fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired 

business and operating risks 

data security breaches failures or other incidents could damage our reputation and business our business relies upon receiving processing storing and transmitting sensitive information relating to our operations employees and customers if we fail to maintain a sufficient digital security infrastructure address security vulnerabilities and new threats or deploy adequate technologies to secure our systems against attack we may be subject to security breaches that compromise confidential information adversely affect our ability to operate our business damage our reputation and business adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and expose us to liability we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks systems and data a security failure by one of these third parties could expose our information systems to interruption of operations and security vulnerabilities we also use thirdparty vendors to store and process data for us and they face similar risks our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks or other cyberattacks carried out by cyber criminals or statesponsored actors other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses ransomware or malware cyberattacks and other means which are constantly evolving and difficult to detect although none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations to date we anticipate that attempts to attack our systems services and infrastructure and those of our customers and vendors may grow in frequency and sophistication those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers vendors or other users of our systems through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients 

we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information or that employee corporateowned computers are stolen or customer data media is lost in shipment an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition under state federal and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial although we believe our security controls and infrastructure are adequate to protect our systems and data we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to combat all current and future technological risks and threats advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products the significant amount of capital and other resources we currently expend to protect against the threat of security breaches may prove insufficient to prevent a breach we cannot ensure that any limitationofliability provisions in our customer and user agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors or other contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims relating to a security breach or similar matters the insurance coverage we maintain to address data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise and there is not assurance that such insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in the event of a security breach we may need to spend substantial additional capital and resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

failure to maintain sufficient technological infrastructure or an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers our products and services require substantial investments in technological infrastructure and we have experienced significant growth in the number of users transactions and data that our technological infrastructure supports if we fail to adequately invest in and support our technological infrastructure and processing capacity we may not be able to support our customers’ processing needs and may be more susceptible to interruptions and delays in services damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs implementing modifications and upgrades to our technological infrastructure subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing systems policies procedures and monitoring tools 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we direct the settlement of funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments realtime payments through faster payment networks and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions we could suffer financial as well as reputational loss in addition we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services that we cannot provide ourselves if we are unable to obtain such services in the future or if the price of such services becomes unsustainable our business financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may issue shortterm credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement process a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

failures of thirdparty service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss we rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations we also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers while we have selected these thirdparty vendors carefully we do not control their actions a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to customers such a failure could lead to damage claims loss of customers and reputational harm depending on the duration and severity of the failure third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively our customers could be negatively impacted and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

competition may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or otherwise attract our customers or prevent us from capturing new customers we may need to lower prices or offer other terms that negatively impact our results of operations in order to successfully compete 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of seven or more years we will continue to experience a significant number of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us including reducing the services we provide or negotiating the prices paid for our services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms or if inflation or costs outpace our contractual ability to adjust pricing during our contractual terms our revenues and profit margins will suffer 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

software defects or problems with installations may harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects especially in connection with newly released products and software updates software defects may cause interruptions or delays to our services as we attempt to correct the problem we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our products on systems used by our customers defects in our software installation problems or delays or other difficulties could result in negative publicity loss of revenues loss of competitive position or claims against us by customers in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

regulatory and compliance risks 

the software and services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of software and services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the consumer financial protection bureau and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable federal and state laws and regulations if we or third parties with whom we contract or partner fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion new regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions we will be required to apply substantial research and development and other corporate resources to adapt our products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

compliance with new and existing privacy laws regulations and rules may adversely impact our expenses development and strategy we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity if we fail to comply with such requirements we could be subject to reputational harm regulatory enforcement and litigation the use confidentiality and security of private customer information is under increased scrutiny regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cybersecurity program along with other compliance requirements and the california consumer privacy act the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies have created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all of the mandates in an efficient manner and may increase costs to deliver affected products and services as those requirements are established 

failure to comply or readily address compliance and regulatory rule changes made by payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network compliance rules governing the payment networks we serve including visa mastercard zelle and the clearing house’s rtp network and all rules governing the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules and standards we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations changes made by the networks even when complied with may result in reduction in revenues and increased costs of operations 

economic conditions risks 

a widespread public health crisis could adversely affect our results of operations the widespread outbreak of a communicable illness or disease such as the ongoing covid19 outbreak or other public health crises including government mandates in response to such events can result in significant economic disruptions and uncertainties and could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the conditions caused by such events may affect the rate of spending by our customers and their ability to pay for our products and services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions interfere with our employees’ ability to support our business function disrupt the ability of thirdparty providers we rely upon to deliver services adversely impact our ability to provide onsite services or installations to our customers or reduce the number of transactions we process all of which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position we are unable to accurately predict the impact of such events on our business due to a number of uncertainties including the duration severity geographic reach and governmental responses to such events the impact on our customers’ and vendors operations and our ability to provide products and services including the impact of our employees working remotely if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business will be harmed 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending resulting in reduced transaction volumes and our related revenues 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 4950 commercial and savings banks and more than 5200 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions in the united states has experienced a steady decrease over recent decades due to mergers and acquisitions and financial failures and we expect this trend to continue as more consolidation occurs such events may reduce the number of our current and potential customers which could negatively impact our results of operations 

acquisition risks 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

acquisitions subject us to risks and may be costly and difficult to integrate acquisitions are difficult to evaluate and our due diligence may not identify all potential liabilities or valuation issues we may also be subject to risks related to cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities of the acquired company and the acquired systems we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs and liabilities unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets 

intellectual property risks 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we also use certain open source software in our products which may subject us to suits by persons claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may adversely affect our competitive position our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary systems and technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or access systems or technology that we consider proprietary we actively take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights including entering into agreements with users of our services for that purpose and maintaining security measures however these steps may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and misappropriation or litigation relating to such matters could have a material negative effect on our results of operation 

general risk factors 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

the loss of key employees and difficulties in hiring and retaining employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers further we are facing an increasingly competitive market for hiring and retaining skilled employees which is exacerbated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and increased acceptance of hiring remote working employees by our competitors and other companies difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees may restrict our ability to adequately support our business needs andor result in increased personnel costs there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to maintain the company’s strategic direction 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2021 on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

covid19 impact and response 

since its outbreak in early 2020 covid19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in march 

2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work offsite and we suspended all nonessential business travel this companywide recommendation extended until july 1 2021 at which point we began transition to a return to our facilities and normalization of travel activities individual decisions on returning to the office were managercoordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments a large number of our employees requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and inperson working we have not required employees who return to our facilities to receive vaccinations but we have provided information on vaccine providers as well as hosted onsite covid19 vaccination clinics at several of our facilities for our employees and their families on august 3 2021 we reimplemented our companywide recommendation for remote work and are encouraging a cautious approach to business travel based on the spread of the delta variant and increased infection rates for those employees who are at our facilities we have introduced enhanced sanitation procedures and we require face masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees as of august 13 2021 the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity 

customers 

we work closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the covid19 pandemic even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been curtailed we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2021 and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak including the onset of variants of the virus the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments the speed of economic recovery the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees and how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing and installationrelated revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows 

results of operations 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2021 total revenue increased 4 or 61158 compared to fiscal 2020 reducing total revenue for the effects of deconversion fees of 20635 for the current fiscal year and 53914 for the prior fiscal year and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2021 of 9 and in fiscal 2020 of 3574 results in a 6 increase or 98002 this increase was primarily driven by growth in card processing data processing and hosting fee jack henry digital and remittance fee and software usage fee revenues partially offset by lower hardware revenues and decreased passthrough billable travel and user group expenses year over year due to covid19 travel limitations see covid19 impact and response above 

operating expenses increased 3 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher costs related to our card payment processing platform associated with corresponding increases in revenue higher personnel costs and increased operating licenses and fees partially offset by more capitalized costs related to research and development travel expense savings as a result of covid19 travel limitations see covid19 impact and response above the gain on sale of assets this fiscal year compared to the loss last fiscal year and lower hardware costs associated with a corresponding decrease in revenues 

we move into fiscal 2022 following strong performance in fiscal 2021 significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability efficiency and security we believe our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 follows 

revenue 

services and support includes private and public cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of seven years or greater at inception product delivery and services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses implementation services deconversion fees consulting and hardware and onpremise support revenue which is composed primarily of maintenance fees with annual contract terms 

in the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 services and support revenue remained consistent compared to the prior fiscal year reducing total services and support revenue by the effects of deconversion fees for each year which totaled 20635 in fiscal 2021 and 53914 in fiscal 2020 and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2020 of 3572 revenue grew 3 this increase was primarily driven by higher private and public cloud revenue resulting from organic growth in data processing and hosting fee revenue reflecting a continuing shift of customers to our term license model growth in software usage revenue also contributed to the increase decreased passthrough expenses due to covid19 travel limitations see covid19 impact and response above and lower hardware revenues partially offset revenue increases 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and automated clearinghouse ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

processing revenue increased 10 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 with strong organic growth in the card transaction and digital and remittance revenue components primarily due to expanding volumes 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 increased 5 compared to fiscal 2020 reducing total cost of revenue for the effects of deconversion fees from each year which totaled 1425 in fiscal 2021 and 4055 in fiscal 2020 and for the effects of acquisitions divestitures and gainloss of 123 in the current fiscal year and 2151 in the prior fiscal year cost of revenue increased 6 this increase was driven by higher direct costs associated with our card processing platform in correlation with related revenue increases higher personnel costs and operating licenses and fees partially offset by savings realized from travel limitations due to covid19 see covid19 impact and 

response above and lower hardware costs corresponding with decreased hardware revenue cost of revenue increased 1 as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer driven 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2021 decreased 1 compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to higher capitalized research and development costs partially offset by an increase in personnel costs the consistency of this expense category for the fiscal years presented reflected our continuing commitment to the development of strategic products research and development expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 



selling general and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts commissions finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 decreased 6 compared to fiscal 2020 reducing total selling general and administrative expense for the effects of deconversion fees from each year which totaled 489 in fiscal 2021 and 973 in fiscal 2020 and for the effects of acquisitions divestitures and gainloss of 1950 for the current fiscal year and of 4893 for the prior fiscal year selling general and administrative expense decreased 2 compared to fiscal 2020 this decrease was primarily due to travel expense and other savings as a result of covid19 travel limitations partially offset by increased personnel costs covid19 related savings included our national sales meeting jack henry annual conference and symitar education conference being held virtually during the current fiscal year see covid19 impact and response above selling general and administrative expense decreased 1 as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 mainly due to the timing and amounts of borrowed balances 



the decrease in the companys effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a greater benefit in the current fiscal year related to stockbased compensation 



net income grew 5 to 311469 or 412 per diluted share in fiscal 2021 from 296668 or 386 per diluted share in fiscal 2020 the diluted earnings per share increase year over year was 7 growth in net income and earnings per share was primarily due to the organic growth in our lines of revenue in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and expense savings from covid19 related impacts in the current fiscal year see covid19 impact and response above 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations 

the company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments core payments complementary and corporate and other the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and maintain centralized customermember information the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services including atm debit and credit card processing services online and mobile bill pay solutions ach origination and remote deposit capture processing and risk management products and services the complementary segment provides additional software hosted processing platforms and services including call center support and network security management consulting and monitoring that can be integrated with our core solutions and many can be used independently the corporate and other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 jack henrys call center was consolidated into the complementary segment as a result of this consolidation immaterial adjustments were made during fiscal 2021 to reclassify related revenue and costs recognized during the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 from the core to the complementary segment the total related revenue reclassified was 20797 for fiscal 2020 and 13515 for fiscal 2019 the total related cost of revenue reclassified was 12386 for fiscal 2020 and 8513 for fiscal 2019

other costs related to the organic growth in card processing and remittance fees cost of revenue increased 15 as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



revenue in the complementary segment increased 4 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reducing total complementary revenue by the effects of deconversion fees from both years which totaled 6778 in fiscal 2021 and 12536 in fiscal 2020 and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures of 9 from fiscal 2021 complementary segment revenue increased 6 this increase was driven by organic increases in our private and public cloud revenue jack henry digital and onpremise support revenues cost of revenue in the complementary segment increased 4 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased personnel costs and amortization expense mainly related to capitalized software cost of revenue remained consistent as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 



revenue in the corporate and other segment decreased 15 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was mainly due to decreased hardware revenue and lower passthrough user group revenue due to covid19 limitations see covid19 impact and response above 

cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments and increased 2 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increased cost of revenue was primarily related to increased licenses and fees and personnel costs partially offset by lower hardware costs associated with the decrease in hardware revenue 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 50992 at june 30 2021 from 213345 at june 30 2020 cash was lower at the end of fiscal 2021 compared to the end of fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increase in net cash used in financing activities including an increase in the purchase of treasury stock of approximately 360000 and the decrease in cash provided by operating activities including lower deconversion fees collected of approximately 22000 or about 61 year over year decreases in cash were partially offset by an increase in credit facility borrowings and a decrease in cash used in investing activities including a 57 decrease in capital expenditures and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions year over year 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 decreased 9 compared to fiscal 2020 cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends and repurchase stock and for capital expenditures

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in january 2017 the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation rather entities should apply the same impairment assessment to all reporting units and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the company adopted asu no 201704 on july 1 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 or cecl which prescribes an impairment model for most financial instruments based on expected losses rather than incurred losses under this model an estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the instrument is to be recorded as of the end of a reporting period as an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial instrument for most instruments entities must apply the standard using a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 

the company adopted cecl effective july 1 2020 using the required modified retrospective approach which resulted in a cumulativeeffect decrease to beginning retained earnings of 493 financial assets and liabilities held by the company subject to the “expected credit loss” model prescribed by cecl include trade and other receivables as well as contract assets see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

not adopted at fiscal year end 

in december of 2019 the fasb issued asu no 201912 income taxes topic 740 simplifying the accounting for income taxes which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of topic 740 guidance the asu is effective for the company on july 1 2021 the company adopted asu 201912 effective july 1 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from data processing transaction processing software licensing and related services professional services and hardware sales 

significant judgments in application of the guidance 

identification of performance obligations 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance 

obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  that is if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer 

determination of transaction price 

the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer our contracts with our customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration we estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method based on both historical and current information where appropriate we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are longterm and include uncertain transactional volumes 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer this assessment is made at the performance obligation level 

allocation of transaction price 

the transaction price once determined is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices the standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available including reference to historical pricing data 

contract costs 

we incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered these costs consist primarily of sales commissions which are incurred only if a contract is obtained and customer conversion or implementationrelated costs 

capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results for longlived assets we consider whether any impairment indicators are present if impairment indicators are identified we test the recoverability of the longlived assets if this recoverability test is failed we determine the fair value of the longlived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than its carrying value 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant areas of judgment include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate 

amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments include a qualitative assessment of factors that may indicate a potential for impairment such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market changes our overall financial performance changes in share price and an assessment of other events or changes in circumstances that could negatively impact us if that qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative assessment is then required including an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates our most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have 100 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2021 and a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by 1 million

covid19 impact and response 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus “covid19” as a pandemic and the president of the united states declared the outbreak as a national emergency as covid19 has 

rapidly spread federal state and local governments have responded by imposing varying degrees of restrictions including widespread “stayathome” orders social distancing requirements travel limitations quarantines and forced closures or limitations on operations of nonessential businesses such restrictions have resulted in significant economic disruptions and uncertainty 

the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in march 2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allow them to work offsite this recommended remote working option is currently extended until at least january 4 2021 and our internal task force will continue to evaluate recommending further extensions based on guidance from the us department of homeland security’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency the company was designated as essential critical infrastructure because of our support of the financial services industry as of august 13 2020 the majority of our employees were working remotely our internal task force considers federal state and local guidance as well as employeespecific and facilityspecific factors when recommending company actions at such time that our internal task force recommends that our remote employees begin to return to our facilities we have prepared procedures to assist with a safe gradual and deliberate approach including a returntooffice training enhanced sanitation procedures and face mask requirements which are currently being utilized by our employees who are required to be on site to perform their required job functions 

we have suspended all nonessential business travel until at least january 4 2021 and our internal task force will continue to evaluate the need for further extensions we have put additional safety precautions into place for travel that is essential we have also updated the health benefits available to our employees by waiving outofpocket expenses related to testing and treatment of covid19 despite the move to a principally remote workforce we honored our 2020 summer internship program through virtual methods 

customers 

we are working closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the covid19 pandemic however we have experienced delays related to continuing customer migrations to our new card processing platform we are on track to meet the revised schedule to complete migrations of our core customers by september 30 2020 and noncore customers by march 31 2021 to the new platform we continue to work with our customers to support them during this difficult time and to that end have waived certain late fees in connection with our products and services we have also enhanced our lending service offerings to support the paycheck protection program that was introduced by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act which was signed into law on march 27 2020 even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been curtailed we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely for the foreseeable future without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

we saw a decrease of card processing transaction volumes late in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and into the early portion of the fourth quarter due to covid19 which slowed the rate of growth of our processing revenue for those periods versus a year ago in addition installations have been delayed and the associated revenue pushed from the current period to future periods these headwinds may also impact our processing and installation revenues moving into fiscal 2021 although transaction levels have since returned to more normal levels the recurrence of lowerthannormal card processing transaction rates is uncertain and will depend upon when requirements for business closures and other restrictions are normalized and how quickly economic recovery occurs despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during the fourth quarter and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak the speed of economic recovery and the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees as well as how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k

• maintaining a companywide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention 

• capitalizing on our acquisition strategy 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 34 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

• expand our suite of complementary products and services 

• provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and noncore customers and outside our base to new customers and or 

• provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry 

we have completed five acquisitions in the last 3 years after 44 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders while we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends 

our most recent acquisitions were

customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided in our private cloud through a highly resilient data center configuration across multiple physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five or more years that include per account fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period

complementary products and services 

we have more than 140 complementary products and services that are targeted to our core banks and more than 100 targeted to credit union customers many of these are selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems

implementation and training 

most of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities or work remotely with clients to help manage the implementation process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed

most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 20 of the respective product’s software license fee the subsequent years service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests we believe this process confirms that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2020 totaled 9043 million consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of 689 million and outsourcing services of 8354 million approximately 6460 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2020 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2021 due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2019 totaled 7852 million consisting of 776 million for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and 7076 million for outsourcing services 

our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2021 the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships existing inhouse customers electing to migrate to the outsourced model and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will 

remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and finastra profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired 

security problems could damage our reputation and business our business relies upon receiving processing storing and transmitting sensitive information relating to our operations employees and customers if we fail to maintain a sufficient digital security infrastructure address security vulnerabilities and new threats or deploy adequate technologies to secure our systems against attack we may be subject to security breaches that compromise confidential information adversely affect our ability to operate our business damage our reputation and business adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and expose us to liability we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks systems and data a security failure by one of these third parties could expose our information systems to interruption of operations and security vulnerabilities our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks or other cyberattacks carried out by cyber criminals or statesponsored actors other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access 

to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses ransomware or malware cyberattacks and other means which are constantly evolving and difficult to detect although none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations to date we anticipate that attempts to attack our systems services and infrastructure and those of our customers and vendors may grow in frequency and sophistication those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers vendors or other users of our systems through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients 

we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information or that employee corporateowned computers are stolen or customer data media is lost in shipment an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition under state federal and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial although we believe our security controls and infrastructure are adequate to protect our systems and data we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to combat all current and future technological risks and threats advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

failure to maintain sufficient technological infrastructure or operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers our products and services require substantial investments in technological infrastructure if we fail to adequately invest in and support our technological infrastructure and processing capacity we may not be able to support our customers’ processing needs and may be more susceptible to interruptions and delays in services damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we direct the settlement of funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments realtime payments through faster payment networks and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions we could suffer financial as well as reputational loss in addition we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services that we cannot provide ourselves if we are unable to obtain such services in the future or if the price of such services becomes unsustainable our business financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may issue shortterm credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement process a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

failures of thirdparty service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss we rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations we also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers while we have selected these thirdparty vendors carefully we do not control their actions a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to customers such a failure could lead to damage claims loss of customers and reputational harm depending on the duration and severity of the failure third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or 

failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively our customers could be negatively impacted and it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the software and services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of software and services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the consumer financial protection bureau and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion new regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions substantial research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

compliance with new and existing privacy laws regulations and rules may adversely impact our expenses development and strategy we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity if we fail to comply with such requirements we could be subject to reputational harm regulatory enforcement and litigation the use confidentiality and security of private customer information is under increased scrutiny regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cybersecurity program along with other compliance requirements and the california consumer privacy act effective as of january 2020 the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies have created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all of the mandates in an efficient manner and may increase costs to deliver affected products and services as those requirements are established 

a widespread public health crisis could adversely affect our results of operations the widespread outbreak of a communicable illness or disease such as the outbreak of covid19 during 2020 or other public health crises including government mandates in response to such events can result in significant economic disruptions and uncertainties and could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the conditions caused by such events may affect the rate of spending by our customers and their ability to pay for our products and services delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions interfere with our employees’ ability to support our business function disrupt the ability of thirdparty providers we rely upon to deliver services adversely impact our ability to provide onsite services or installations to our customers or reduce the number of transactions we process all of which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position we are unable to accurately predict the impact of such events on our business due to a number of uncertainties including the duration severity geographic reach and governmental responses to such events the impact on our customers’ and vendors operations and our ability to provide products and services including the impact of our employees working remotely if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business will be harmed 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have 

a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending resulting in reduced transaction volumes and our related revenues 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 5131 commercial and savings banks and more than 5340 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions in the united states has experienced a steady decrease over recent decades due to financial failures and mergers and acquisitions and we expect this trend to continue as more consolidation occurs such events may reduce the number of our current and potential customers which could negatively impact our results of operations 

competition may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or otherwise attract our customers or prevent us from capturing new customers we may need to lower prices or offer other terms that negatively impact our results of operations in order to successfully compete 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us including reducing the services we provide or negotiating the prices paid for our services if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our revenues and profit margins will suffer 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to maintain the company’s strategic direction 

failure to comply or readily address compliance and regulatory rule changes made by payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network compliance rules governing the payment networks we serve including visa mastercard zelle and the clearing house’s rtp network and all rules governing the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations changes made by the networks even when complied with may result in reduction in revenues and increased cost of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as 

planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

software defects or problems with installations may harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects especially in connection with newly released products and software updates software defects may cause interruptions or delays to our services as we attempt to correct the problem we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our products on systems used by our customers defects in our software installation problems or delays or other difficulties could result in negative publicity loss of revenues loss of competitive position or claims against us by customers in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

acquisitions subject us to risks and may be costly and difficult to integrate acquisitions are difficult to evaluate and our due diligence may not identify all potential liabilities or valuation issues we may also be subject to risks related to cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities of the acquired company and the acquired systems we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs and liabilities unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we also use certain open source software in our products which may subject us to suits by persons claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may adversely affect our competitive position our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary systems and technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or access systems or technology that we consider proprietary we actively take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights including entering into agreements with users of our services for that purpose and maintaining security measures however these steps may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and misappropriation or litigation relating to such matters could have a material negative effect on our results of operation 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2020 on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

covid19 impact and response 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a pandemic and the president of the united states declared the outbreak as a national emergency as covid19 has rapidly spread federal state and local governments have responded by imposing varying degrees of restrictions including widespread “stayathome” orders social distancing requirements travel limitations quarantines and forced closures or limitations on operations of nonessential businesses such restrictions have resulted in significant economic disruptions and uncertainty 

the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us in march 2020 we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the covid19 situation and recommend company actions we offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allow them to work offsite this recommended remote working option is currently extended until at least january 4 2021 and our internal task force will continue to evaluate recommending further extensions based on guidance from the us department of homeland security’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency the company was designated as essential critical infrastructure because of our support of the financial services industry as of august 13 2020 the majority of our employees were working remotely our internal task force considers federal state and local guidance as well as employeespecific and facilityspecific factors when recommending company actions at such time that our internal task force recommends that our remote employees begin to return to our facilities we have prepared procedures to assist with a safe gradual and deliberate approach including a returntooffice training enhanced sanitation procedures and face mask requirements which are currently being utilized by our employees who are required to be on site to perform their required job functions 

we have suspended all nonessential business travel until at least january 4 2021 and our internal task force will continue to evaluate the need for further extensions we have put additional safety precautions into place for travel that is essential we have also updated the health benefits available to our employees by waiving outofpocket expenses related to testing and treatment of covid19 despite the move to a principally remote workforce we honored our 2020 summer internship program through virtual methods 

customers 

we are working closely with our customers who are scheduled for onsite visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site delays of customer system installations due to covid19 have been limited and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available we expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the 

covid19 pandemic however we have experienced delays related to continuing customer migrations to our new card processing platform we are on track to meet the revised schedule to complete migrations of our core customers by september 30 2020 and noncore customers by march 31 2021 to the new platform we continue to work with our customers to support them during this difficult time and to that end have waived certain late fees in connection with our products and services we have also enhanced our lending service offerings to support the paycheck protection program that was introduced by the cares act which was signed into law on march 27 2020 even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been curtailed we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations we believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely for the foreseeable future without materially impacting our business 

financial impact 

we saw a decrease of card processing transaction volumes late in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and into the early portion of the fourth quarter due to covid19 which slowed the rate of growth of our processing revenue for those periods versus a year ago in addition installations have been delayed and the associated revenue pushed from the current period to future periods these headwinds may also impact our processing and installation revenues moving into fiscal 2021 although transaction levels have since returned to more normal levels the recurrence of lowerthannormal card processing transaction rates is uncertain and will depend upon when requirements for business closures and other restrictions are normalized and how quickly economic recovery occurs despite the changes and restrictions caused by covid19 the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity balance sheet and business trends remain strong we experienced positive operating cash flows during the fourth quarter and we do not expect that to change in the near term however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid19 due to a number of uncertainties including further government actions the duration severity and recurrence of the outbreak the speed of economic recovery and the potential impact to our customers vendors and employees as well as how the potential impact might affect future customer services processing revenue and processes and efficiencies within the company directly or indirectly impacting financial results we will continue to monitor covid19 and its possible impact on the company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers for a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with covid19 see part ii item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows 

results of operations 

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2020 revenues increased 9 or 144376 compared to fiscal 2019 deconversion fees increased 23684 to 53914 compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from fiscal 2020 acquisitions totaled 8969 excluding these factors adjusted revenue increased 7 with growth in each of our revenue streams as discussed in detail below 

operating expenses increased 9 year over year primarily due to costs related to our new card payment processing platform increased salaries and benefits in fiscal 2020 partly due to increased headcount compared to fiscal 2019 increases in related revenue and increased depreciation and amortization expense 

we move into fiscal 2021 following strong performance in fiscal 2020 significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability efficiency and security we believe our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 follows 

revenue 



services and support includes outsourcing and cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception product delivery and services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses implementation services deconversion fees consulting and hardware and inhouse support revenue which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms 

in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 services and support revenue grew 10 over the prior fiscal year excluding deconversion fees from each period which totaled 53914 in fiscal 2020 and 30230 in fiscal 2019 and excluding revenue from the fiscal 2020 acquisition totaling 8969 adjusted services and support revenue grew 6 the adjusted increase was primarily driven by an increase in outsourcing and cloud revenue resulting from organic growth in data processing and hosting fee revenue as well as higher implementation fee revenue primarily related to our private cloud offerings higher software usage revenue within inhouse support also contributed to the increase resulting partially from the addition of new customers these increases were partially offset by decreased maintenance fees within inhouse support revenue and onpremise implementation fees within product delivery and services revenue due to more customers opting for outsourced delivery 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

processing revenue increased 9 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 with strong organic growth in each component 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue for fiscal 2020 increased 9 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding costs related to deconversion fees from each period which totaled 4055 in fiscal 2020 and 2192 in fiscal 2019 and excluding costs related to the fiscal 2020 acquisition totaling 4054 adjusted cost of revenue also increased 9 the adjusted increase was driven by higher direct costs of product including spending related to the ongoing project to expand our credit and debit card platform and increases in related revenue higher salary and benefit expenses in part due to a 5 increase in headcount at june 30 2020 compared to a year ago that reflects organic growth within our product lines and increased depreciation and amortization expense mainly related to capitalized software partially offsetting adjusted cost of revenue increases were the savings realized from nonessential travel restrictions imposed at the company due to the covid19 pandemic see covid19 impact and response on page 23 cost of revenue remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the company continues to focus on management of costs which contributes to the consistency of this percentage 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer driven 

research and development expenses for fiscal 2020 increased 14 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding costs related to the fiscal 2020 acquisition totaling 1980 adjusted research and development expense increased 12 

the adjusted increase was primarily due to increased salary and benefit expenses in part due to a 4 increase in headcount at june 30 2020 compared to a year ago that reflects organic growth within our product lines as well as an increase in licenses and fees a portion of the adjusted research and development expense is a result of our investment in digital platforms research and development expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the company continues to focus on management of costs which contributes to the consistency of this percentage 



selling general and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts commissions finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs excluding costs related to deconversion fees from fiscal 2020 there were no deconversion fees related to selling general and administrative for fiscal 2019 which totaled 973 the fiscal 2020 acquisition of 2063 and the fiscal 2020 loss on disposal of certain assets net of 4789 adjusted selling general and administrative expense increased 2 compared to fiscal 2019 the adjusted increase was primarily due to increased salaries and benefit expenses in part due to a 5 increase in headcount at june 30 2020 compared to a year ago partially offsetting adjusted selling general and administrative expense increases were the savings realized from nonessential travel restrictions imposed at the company due to the covid19 pandemic see covid19 impact and response on page 23 selling general and administrative expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the company continues to focus on management of costs which contributes to the consistency of this percentage 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense decreased in fiscal 2020 due mainly to lower interest rates during the year and the timing of invested balances 



the increase to the companys effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the difference in the tax benefits recognized from stockbased compensation between the two periods 

net income 

net income increased 9 to 296668 or 386 per diluted share in fiscal 2020 from 271885 or 352 per diluted share in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increased deconversion fee revenue organic growth in our lines of revenue year over year and inorganic contributions from our fiscal 2020 acquisition 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations 

the company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments core payments complementary and corporate and other the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and maintain centralized customermember information the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services including atm debit and credit card processing services online and mobile bill pay solutions ach origination and remote deposit capture processing and risk management products and services the complementary segment provides additional software processing platforms and services that can be integrated 

with our core solutions or used independently the corporate and other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments 

during fiscal 2020 immaterial adjustments were made to reclassify revenue recognized in fiscal 2019 from the complementary to the core segment and from the complementary to the payments segment to be consistent with the current years allocation of revenue by segment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 the amount reclassified totaled 2614 



in fiscal 2020 revenue in the core segment increased 9 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding deconversion fees from both years which totaled 25927 in fiscal 2020 and 14907 in fiscal 2019 adjusted revenue in the core segment increased 7 the adjusted increase was primarily due to increased outsourcing and cloud revenue cost of revenue in the core segment increased 4 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increased salaries and benefits partially due to increased headcount at june 30 2020 compared to a year ago cost of revenue decreased 2 as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

revenue in the complementary segment increased 11 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding deconversion fees from both years which totaled 12145 in fiscal 2020 and 6672 in fiscal 2019 and excluding revenue of 8969 from fiscal 2020 acquisitions adjusted revenue in the complementary segment increased 8 the adjusted increase was driven by increases in outsourcing and cloud and inhouse support revenue within our services and support revenue line as well as transaction and digital processing revenue within our processing revenue line cost of revenue in the complementary segment increased 9 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increased amortization expense mainly related to capitalized software and higher direct costs largely related to the growth in outsourcing and cloud cost of revenue decreased 1 as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 



the increase in revenue in the corporate and other segment for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was mainly due to increased hardware revenue within our services and support revenue line 

cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments the increased cost of revenue in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily related to increased salaries and benefits partially due to increased headcount at june 30 2020 compared to a year ago and increased depreciation expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys cash and cash equivalents increased to 213345 at june 30 2020 from 93628 at june 30 2019 cash at the end of fiscal 2020 was higher primarily due to an increase in net cash from operating activities partially offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock and an increase in dividends paid

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in august of 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 201815 intangibles goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic 35040 which broadens the scope of subtopic 35040 to include costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract the costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which they are incurred consistent with costs for internaluse software the amendments in this update can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption the required asu effective date for the company is july 1 2020 with early adoption permitted the company earlyadopted asu no 201815 for its fiscal 2020 third quarter the company chose prospective adoption and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the quarter or yeartodate period 

the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases in february 2016 this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases specifically the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straightline basis 

the company adopted the new standard effective july 1 2019 using the optional transition method in asu 201811 under this method the company did not adjust its comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new standard or make the new expanded required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date the company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new standard which among other things allows it to carry forward its historical lease classifications in addition the company has made a policy election to keep leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off of the balance sheet the company also elected the practical expedient to not separate the nonlease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate 

the adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities of 77393 and righttouse assets of 74084 as of july 1 2019 adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the company’s condensed consolidated statements of income or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 

not adopted at fiscal year end 

in december of 2019 the fasb issued asu no 201912 income taxes topic 740 simplifying the accounting for income taxes which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of topic 740 guidance the asu will be effective for the company on july 1 2021 early adoption of the amendments is permitted including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued an entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period additionally an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period the company will adopt asu no 201912 when required or sooner as allowed and is assessing the timing of adoption and evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation rather entities should apply the same impairment assessment to all reporting units and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary asu no 201704 will be effective prospectively for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted the company adopted asu no 201704 on july 1 2020 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected with an allowance for credit losses valuation account that is deducted to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impacts of adopting this standard including the processes systems data and controls that will be necessary to estimate credit reserves for impacted areas financial assets held by the company subject to the “expected credit loss” model prescribed by 

the standard include trade and other receivables and contract assets while the company continues to evaluate the expected impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures it currently expects the adoption of this guidance will result in an acceleration in the timing for recognition of credit losses and may also result in an increase in the reserve for these credit losses due to the requirement to record upfront the losses that are expected over the remaining contractual lives of its financial assets the company adopted asu no 201613 on july 1 2020 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from data processing transaction processing software licensing and related services professional services and hardware sales 

significant judgments in application of the guidance 

identification of performance obligations 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  that is if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer 

determination of transaction price 

the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer our contracts with our customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration we estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method based on both historical and current information where appropriate we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are longterm and include uncertain transactional volumes 

taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue we include reimbursements from customers for expenses incurred in providing services such as for postage travel and telecommunications costs in revenue while the related costs are included in cost of revenue 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer this assessment is made at the performance obligation level 

allocation of transaction price 

the transaction price once determined is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices the standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available including reference to historical pricing data 

the following describes the nature of our primary types of revenue 

processing 

processing revenue is generated from transactionbased fees for electronic deposit and payment services electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services and pricing may include tiered pricing structures amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed customers are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month we evaluate tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists if after that evaluation we determine a material right does exist we assign value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right 

outsourcing and cloud 

outsourcing and cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services and pricing may include tiered pricing structures amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed data and item processing services are typically billed monthly we evaluate tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists if after that evaluation we determine a material right does exist we assign value to the material right based upon standalone selling price 

product delivery and services 

product delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery software licenses along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct are recognized as they are delivered to the customer hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification therefore we recognize these fees over the remaining modified contract term 

inhouse support 

inhouse support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage which includes a license and ongoing client support our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services software maintenance fees are typically billed to the customer annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term software usage is typically billed annually in advance with the license delivered and recognized at the outset and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term accordingly we utilize the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less 

contract costs 

we incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered these costs consist primarily of sales commissions which are incurred only if a contract is obtained and customer conversion or implementationrelated costs 

capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market 

conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results for longlived assets we consider whether any impairment indicators are present if impairment indicators are identified we test the recoverability of the longlived assets if this recoverability test is failed we determine the fair value of the longlived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than its carrying value 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant areas of judgment include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments include a qualitative assessment of factors that may indicate a potential for impairment such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market changes our overall financial performance changes in share price and an assessment of other events or changes in circumstances that could negatively impact us if that qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative assessment is then required including an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous 

company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates our most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2020 and are therefore not currently exposed to interest rate risk

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in four  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts 

for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   140  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs

implementation and training 

most of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 20 of the respective product’s software license fee the subsequent years service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as 

additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests we believe this process confirms that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

hardware systems 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation fulfilled directly and through ibm distributors and many other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers w e currently sell ibm power systems lenovo dell and hp servers and workstations canon digital check epson and panini check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

electronic payment solutions 

electronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing attract profitable retail and commercial accounts increase operating efficiencies comply with regulatory mandates and proactively mitigate and manage paymentrelated risk 

jack henry identifies four components of electronic payment solutions 

 backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2019  totaled 7852 million  consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of 776 million  and outsourcing services of 7076 million  approximately 5140 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2019 is not expected to be realized 

during fiscal 2020 due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2018 totaled 6762 million  consisting of 763 million for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and 5999 million for outsourcing services 

our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2020  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships existing inhouse customers electing to migrate to the outsourced model and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  were 964 million  903 million  and 848 million  respectively we recorded capitalized software in fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  of 1111 million  966 million  and 896 million  respectively 

sales and marketing

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and finastra profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks systems and data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses ransomware or malware cyberattacks and other means to date none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers suppliers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state federal and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and 

consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments realtime payments through faster payment networks and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services if we are unable to obtain such services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

failures of third party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss we rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations we also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers while we have selected these third party vendors carefully we do not control their actions a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to customers such a failure could lead to damages claims loss of customers and reputational harm depending on the duration and severity of the failure third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the software and services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of software and services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion new regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions substantial research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

compliance with new and existing privacy laws regulations and rules may adversely impact our expenses development and strategy  concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cybersecurity program along with other compliance requirements the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies has created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all of the mandates in an efficient manner and may increase costs to deliver affected products and services as those requirements are established 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and our related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions because our business is concentrated in financial institutions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers we could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks or changes made by the networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard zelle the clearing house’s rtp network and all rules governing the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations changes made by the networks even if complied with may result in reduction in revenues and increased cost of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately   5363  commercial and savings banks and more than   5480  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs and liabilities unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations   our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2019  on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows 

results of operations 

fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2019  revenues increased 6  or 81894  compared to fiscal 2018  deconversion fees decreased 15941  compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from fiscal 2019  acquisitions totaled 1052  excluding these factors total revenue increased 7  with growth in each of our revenue streams as discussed in detail below 

operating expenses increased 8  year over year primarily due to increased salaries and benefits in fiscal 2019  partly due to increased headcount compared to fiscal 2018  costs related to our new card payment processing platform bonuses provided by the company in response to the lower tax rate resulting from the tcja the ensenta acquisition increased rent expense related to new facilities and increased amortization expense 

the tcja had a large impact on our fiscal 2018  provision benefit for income taxes and net income which impacted yearoveryear comparison as discussed below 

we move into fiscal 2020  following a strong performance in fiscal 2019  significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability efficiency and security we believe our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2019  follows fiscal years 2018  and 2017  have been recast to reflect our retrospective adoption of accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers and related amendments collectively referred to as accounting standards codification asc 606 

revenue 



services and support includes outsourcing and cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception product delivery  services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses implementation services deconversion fees consulting and hardware and inhouse support revenue which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms 

in the fiscal year ended   june 30 2019  services and support revenue grew 4  over the prior fiscal year excluding deconversion fees which totaled 30230  in fiscal 2019  and 46171  in fiscal 2018  and excluding revenue from fiscal 2019  acquisitions totaling 944  services and support revenue grew 6  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in outsourcing and cloud revenue resulting from organic growth in hosting and data processing fees complemented by added revenue from ensenta inhouse support revenue also contributed to the increase primarily from higher software usage revenue resulting partially from the addition of new customers these increases were partially offset by decreased product delivery and services revenue due to reduced license and inhouse implementation revenue as more customers opted for outsourced delivery 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and automated clearing house ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

processing revenue increased 8  for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2019  as compared to the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  with strong organic growth in each component complemented by added remittance revenue from ensenta

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased 7  primarily due to increased salary and benefit expenses in part due to a 3  increase in headcount but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue excluding the bonuses provided by the company in response to the lower tax rate following the tcja and costs attributable to companies acquired in fiscal 2019 research and development expense increased 4  



selling general and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts commissions finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs excluding bonuses provided by the company in response to the lower tax rate resulting from the tcja selling general and administrative expense increased 6  these expenses increased primarily due to increased commissions salaries and benefits

interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense decreased in fiscal 2019  due mainly to lower amounts borrowed on our revolving credit facility during the year 



the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the significant tax benefit recognized in the prior fiscal year as a result of the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities upon enactment of the tcja on december 22 2017 that increase in the provision benefit for income taxes is partially offset by the reduced us federal corporate tax rate of 21  effective for the current year and increased excess tax benefits from sharebased payments recognized during fiscal 2019    excluding the fiscal 2018 tcja tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities provision benefit for income taxes decrease d 23  

net income 

net income decreased 26  to 271885  or 352  per diluted share in fiscal 2019  from 365034  or 470  per diluted share in fiscal 2018  the significant decrease is primarily attributable to the tcja impacts on the prior year provision benefit for income taxes as well as decreased deconversion revenue in fiscal 2019  

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

in fiscal 2018  revenues increased 6  or 82507  compared to fiscal 2017  deconversion fees increased 7343  compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from fiscal 2018  acquisitions totaled 17368  fiscal 2017  included 10897  of revenue from divested companies excluding these factors total revenue increased 5  with growth in each of our revenue streams as discussed in detail below 

operating expenses increased 6  due to increased headcount driving increased salaries and benefits costs related to fiscal 2018  acquisitions and professional services expenses incurred due to contracting with outside experts in preparation for our adoption of the new accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue standard excluding costs related to deconversion fees from each year expenses related to fiscal 2018 acquisitions fiscal 2017 costs related to divestitures and gains on the disposal of businesses from each year operating expenses increased 5  

the tcja had a large impact on our provision benefit for income taxes and net income which are discussed below 

revenue 



services and support revenue grew 4  in fiscal 2018  excluding deconversion fees revenue from fiscal 2018  acquisitions totaling 9074  and fiscal 2017  revenue related to divestitures of 10745  services and support revenue grew 4  the growth was due mainly to increased outsourcing and cloud revenue as well as growth within our inhouse support revenue component due to higher software usage revenue 



processing revenue increased 9  in fiscal 2018  with strong growth in each of its three components ensenta contributed to the growth with added remittance revenue excluding 8294  of revenue from fiscal 2018  acquisitions and excluding fiscal 2017  revenue related to divestitures totaling 152  processing revenue increased 7  for the year with significant increases in each of its three components 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue for fiscal 2018  increased 6  compared to fiscal 2017  in line with the revenue increase and remained a consistent percentage of total revenue in each year 



research and development expenses increased primarily due to a 4 increase in headcount but were consistent 

with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 



selling general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2018  primarily due to increased commissions salaries and benefits and higher professional services expenses incurred due to contracting with outside experts in preparation for our adoption of the asc 606 revenue standard 

gain on disposal of businesses 

in fiscal 2018  we recognized gains on disposal of businesses totaling 1894  due to the sales of our atm manager and jhadirect product lines 

in fiscal 2017  we recognized gains on the disposal of businesses totaling 3270  2136 was related to the fiscal 2016 sale of alogent and 1134 related to the sale of our regulatory filing products to fed reporter on may 1 2017 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense increased in fiscal 2018 due mainly to increased borrowing which was primarily used for the acquisition of ensenta corporation and has now been repaid 



the significant decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of the tcja enacted december 22 2017 which included a reduction to the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 a blended 28 us federal statutory income tax rate was applied to fiscal 2018 we recorded a net tax benefit of 106801  related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities and 21551  related to the impacts on current year operations 

net income 

net income increased 59  to 365034  or 470  per diluted share in fiscal 2018  from 229561  or 293  per diluted share in fiscal 2017  the significant increase is primarily attributable to the tcja 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations   

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 jha changed its reportable segment structure from two customercentric segments bank and credit union to four productcentric segments the change was made based on the view of our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker that the company could be more effectively managed using a productcentric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration 

the company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments core payments complementary and corporate and other the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and maintain centralized customermember information the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services including atm debit and credit card processing services online and mobile bill pay solutions ach origination and remote deposit capture processing and risk management products and services the complementary segment 

provides additional software processing platforms and services that can be integrated with our core solutions or used independently the corporate  other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments   

the fiscal 2017  period presented below has been retroactively recast to conform to the new segment structure adopted july 1 2017 both prior year periods presented have also been recast to reflect the companys retrospective adoption of asc 606 



in fiscal 2019  revenue in the core segment increased 5  compared to fiscal 2018  driven by increases in outsourcing and cloud revenue and inhouse support revenue excluding deconversion fees which totaled 14907  and 22161  for fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively and excluding revenue of 923  from fiscal 2019  acquisitions revenue in the core segment increased 6  due to increased outsourcing and cloud and inhouse support revenue cost of revenue remained a consistent percentage of revenue for fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  

in fiscal 2018  revenue in the core segment increased 7  primarily due to increased revenue within each component of our services and support revenue stream cost of revenue increased 6  for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  but remained consistent as a percentage of revenue 



in fiscal 2019  revenue in the payments segment increased 8  compared to fiscal 2018  excluding deconversion revenue of 8603  and 13004  respectively revenue increased 9  in the payments segment due to organic growth within remittance and card processing as well as added revenue from ensenta cost of revenue increased   11  partially due to increased headcount and amortization expenses related to ensenta as well as increased spending related to the ongoing project to expand our credit and debit card platform cost of revenue increased   2  as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  

in fiscal 2018  revenue in the payments segment increased compared to fiscal 2017  due primarily to increased card and remittance processing revenue the increases were partially due to the acquisition of ensenta cost of revenue increased 10  and increased 1 as a percentage of revenue 



revenue in the complementary segment increased 6  for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2019  compared to the prior year after excluding deconversion revenue from each period which totaled 6672  and 10855  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  and 2018  respectively and excluding revenue of 126  from fiscal 2019  acquisitions revenue increased 7  the increase was driven by increases in outsourcing and cloud revenue and inhouse support within our services and support revenue stream as well as transaction and digital processing revenue within our processing revenue stream cost of revenue increased   7  for the year and increased   1  as a percentage of revenue 

in fiscal 2018  revenue in the complementary segment increased 5  due to higher outsourcing and cloud revenue within services and support as well as increased transaction and digital processing revenue cost of revenue increased 6  for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  but remained a consistent percentage of revenue 



the decrease in revenue in the corporate and other segment for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2019  was due to decreased services and support revenue this is in part due to the sale of our jhadirect product line which was sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2018  

the decreased revenue in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  in the corporate and other segment is largely due to the loss of revenue following the sale of our jhadirect product fiscal 2017  included revenue from jhadirect totaling 6571  

cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments the increased cost of revenue in fiscal 2019  is primarily related to bonuses provided by the company in response to the lower tax rate resulting from the tcja and increased rent and maintenance contract expenses related to new facilities 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys cash and cash equivalents increased to 93628  at june 30 2019  from 31440  at june 30 2018  cash at the end of fiscal 2018  was lower due primarily to the acquisition of ensenta and higher repayment of debt in fiscal 2018  

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

capital requirements and resources 

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures totaling 53598  and 40135  for fiscal years ended june 30 2019  and june 30 2018  respectively were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities these additions 

were funded from cash generated by operations at june 30 2019  the company had an estimated 2673  of outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment 

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facilities the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2019  there were 26508  shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3483  additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2019  is 1110124  during fiscal 2019  the company repurchased 400  treasury shares for 54864  at june 30 2018  there were 26108  shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 3883  additional shares 

revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to 300000  which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to 600000  the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to a a rate based on libor or b an alternate base rate the highest of i the prime rate for such day ii the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus 050  and iii the eurocurrency rate for a onemonth interest period on such day for dollars plus 10  plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the companys leverage ratio the credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement as of june 30 2019  the company was in compliance with all such covenants the revolving credit facility terminates february 20 2020  and at june 30 2019  there was no  outstanding balance prior to termination the company plans to renew the current credit facility or replace it with a similar credit facility 

other lines of credit 

the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on may 1 2019  which provides for funding of up to 5000  and bears interest at the prime rate less 1  the credit line was renewed through april 30 2021  at june 30 2019  no  amount was outstanding 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

at june 30 2019  the company’s total offbalance sheet contractual obligations were 665107  this balance consists of 71633  of longterm operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2020  to 2030  and 593474  of purchase commitments in fiscal 2017 jha entered a strategic services agreement with first data® and pscu® to provide fullservice debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers as well as expand its card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base this agreement includes a purchase commitment of 555754  over the remaining term of the contract the remainder of the purchase commitments relate mainly to open purchase orders the contractual obligations table below excludes 12009  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 



the operating lease obligations included on this table will be recorded on the balance sheet beginning in fiscal 2020 due to the companys adoption of asu no 201602 issued by the fasb in february 2016 and effective for the company on july 1 2019 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  in may 2014 this standard and related amendments collectively referred to as “asc 606” is part of an effort to create a common revenue standard for us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the new standard has superseded much of the authoritative literature for revenue recognition the new model enacts a fivestep process for achieving the core principle which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity 

expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard was effective for the company on july 1 2018 entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods full retrospective or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption modified retrospective 

the company adopted the new standard using the full retrospective transition approach using certain practical expedients the company has not disclosed the amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application also the company did not separately consider the effects of contract modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented but reflects the aggregate effect of all modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented as a result all fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 financial information has been adjusted for the effects of applying asc 606 the details of the significant changes are disclosed below 

software revenue recognition 

the company previously recognized software license and related services within the scope of asc topic 985605 which required the establishment of vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value in order to separately recognize revenue for each softwarerelated good or service due to the inability to establish vsoe the company had previously deferred all revenue on softwarerelated goods and services on a master contract until all the goods and services had been delivered under asc 606 vsoe is no longer required for separation of otherwise distinct performance obligations within a revenue arrangement this change has resulted in earlier recognition of revenue for the company’s softwarerelated goods and services leading to a decrease in deferred revenue balances within its adjusted consolidated balance sheets 

impacts on financial statements 

see tables in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the impacts asc 606 had on prior period financial statements 

asu 201615 issued by the fasb in august 2016 clarifies cash flow classification of eight specific cash flow issues and is effective for our annual reporting period beginning july 1 2018 the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial statements 

not yet adopted 

the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases in february 2016 this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases specifically the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straightline basis asu no 201602 will be effective for jhas annual reporting period beginning july 1 2019 the company established a crossfunctional team to implement this standard and evaluated arrangements that would be subject to the standard implemented software to meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of the standard and assessed the impact of the standard on its processes and internal controls the company will adopt the new standard using the optional transition method in asu 201811 under this method the company will not adjust its comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new standard or make the new expanded required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date the company will recognize a cumulativeeffect adjustment as necessary to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal 2020 upon adoption of the standard 

we will take advantage of the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard which among other things allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification in addition we will make an accounting policy election that will keep leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off of the balance sheet the company also elected the practical expedient not to separate the nonlease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate 

upon adoption of the standard the company will record rightofuse assets of approximately   70000  to 73000  and lease obligations of approximately   73000  to 75000  on the its balance sheet as of july 1 2019 adoption of the standard is not expected to significantly impact the companys net income and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys compliance with the financial covenants under its credit facility 

in august of 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201815 intangibles goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic 35040 which broadens the scope of subtopic 35040 to include costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract the costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which they are incurred consistent with costs for internaluse software the amendments in this update can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption the asu will be effective for the company on july 1 2020 with early adoption permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on its financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from data processing transaction processing software licensing and related services professional services and hardware sales 

significant judgments in application of the guidance 

identification of performance obligations 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  that is if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer 

determination of transaction price 

the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer our contracts with our customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration we estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method based on both historical and current information where appropriate we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are longterm and include uncertain transactional volumes 

taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue we include reimbursements from customers for expenses incurred in providing services such as for postage travel and telecommunications costs in revenue while the related costs are included in cost of revenue 

technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer this assessment is made at the performance obligation level 

allocation of transaction price 

the transaction price once determined is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices the standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service for items that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available including reference to historical pricing data 

the following describes the nature of our primary types of revenue 

processing 

processing revenue is generated from transactionbased fees for electronic deposit and payment services electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services and pricing may include tiered pricing structures amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed customers are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month we evaluate tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists if after that evaluation we determine a material right does exist we assign value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right 

outsourcing and cloud 

outsourcing and cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services and pricing may include tiered pricing structures amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed data and item processing services are typically billed monthly we evaluate tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists if after that evaluation we determine a material right does exist we assign value to the material right based upon standalone selling price 

product delivery and services 

product delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery software licenses along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct are recognized as they are delivered to the customer hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification therefore we recognize these fees over the remaining modified contract term 

inhouse support 

inhouse support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage which includes a license and ongoing client support our arrangements for these services typically require us to “standready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis the fees for these services may be fixed or variable based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services software maintenance fees are typically billed to the customer annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term software usage is typically billed annually in advance with the license delivered and recognized at the outset and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term accordingly we utilize the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less 

contract costs 

we incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered these costs consist primarily of sales commissions which are incurred only if a contract is obtained and customer conversion or implementationrelated costs 

capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results for longlived assets we consider whether any impairment indicators are present if impairment indicators are identified we test the recoverability of the longlived assets if this recoverability test is failed we determine the fair value of the longlived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than its carrying value 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant areas of judgment include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized 

determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments include a qualitative assessment of factors that may indicate a potential for impairment such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market changes our overall financial performance changes in share price and an assessment of other events or changes in circumstances that could negatively impact us if that qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative assessment is then required including an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates our most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on 

outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no  outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2019  and are therefore not currently exposed to interest rate risk

mission statement 

our mission is to protect and increase the value of our stockholders investment by providing quality solutions and industryleading service to our customers in accomplishing this we feel that it is important to 

 business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

 acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 31 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

 we have completed three  acquisitions in the last 3 years after 42  years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends 

our three most recent acquisitions were 



solutions 

our proprietary solutions are marketed through three primary business brands 



be delivered inhouse or through outsourced delivery model and are also backed by our companywide commitment to provide exceptional personal service symitar currently supports nearly   830  credit union customers 

 we will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels regularly updating and improving those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process ensuring compliance with relevant regulations updated with proven advances in technology and consistent with jha’s reputation as a premium product and service provider 

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in three  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs 

jha regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities mitigating and controlling operational risks andor containing costs the company’s industry research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings and manages the introduction of new product offerings jha’s new complementary products and services are developed internally acquired or provided through strategic alliances 

electronic payment solutions 

electronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing attract profitable retail and commercial accounts increase operating efficiencies comply with regulatory mandates and proactively mitigate and manage paymentrelated risk 

jack henry identifies four components of electronic payment solutions 

 hardware systems 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation fulfilled directly and through ibm distributors and many other hardware providers that allow jha to 

purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers w e currently sell ibm power systems lenovo dell and hp servers and workstations canon digital check epson and panini check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

implementation and training 

most of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 of the respective product’s software license fee the subsequent years service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests we believe this process confirms that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2018  totaled 6762 million  consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of approximately 763 million  and 5999 million for outsourcing services approximately 4640 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2018 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2019 due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as 

of june 30 2017 totaled 6303 million  consisting of 789 million for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and 5514 million for outsourcing services 

the inhouse backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of june 30 2018  and 2017  

our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2019  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships existing inhouse customers electing to migrate to the outsourced model and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  were 903 million  848 million  and 812 million  respectively we recorded capitalized software in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  of 966 million  896 million  and 964 million  respectively 

sales and marketing 

jha serves established well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and crosssales opportunities 

the marketing and sales initiatives within the jack henry banking and symitar business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions profitstars sells specialized core agnostic niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters 

dedicated sales forces support each of jha’s three primary marketed brands sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services our sales professionals receive base salaries and performancebased commission compensation brandspecific sales support staff provide a variety of services including product and service demonstrations responses to prospectissued requestsforproposals and proposal and contract generation our marketing department supports all of our brands with lead generation and brandbuilding activities including participation in statespecific regional and national trade shows print and online advertising telemarketing customer newsletters ongoing promotional campaigns and media relations jha also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services 

jha has sold select products and services in the caribbean canada europe and south america international sales accounted for less than   1  of jha’s total revenue in the fiscal years 2018  and 2017  and were approximately   1  of total revenue in fiscal 2016  

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and finastra profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our company’s source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

regulatory compliance 

jha maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given jha’s compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience and a thorough working knowledge of jha and our solutions these compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements including regular discussions on emerging topics with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations 

jha has a process to inform internal departments of new and revised regulatory requirements upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the company’s development teams through monthly regulatory compliance meetings and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle jha publishes newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations periodically customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes 

internal audits of our systems networks operations business recovery plans and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems processes plans and security ensuring that confidential information remains private is a high priority and jha’s initiatives to protect confidential information include regular thirdparty application reviews intended to better secure information access additional thirdparty reviews are performed throughout the organization such as vulnerability tests intrusion tests and system and organizations controls soc 1 or soc 2 reports the ffiec conducts annual reviews throughout the company and issues reports that are reviewed by the jha risk and compliance committee of the board of directors 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation all financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers including but not limited to those mandated by federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules the privacy of consumer financial information regulations usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the grammleachbliley act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the compliance of jha’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design the classification of customers and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services the impact of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act continues to evolve as the regulations are written to implement the various provisions of the law we cannot predict the impact these regulations any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future 

jha is not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions however operating as a service provider to financial institutions jha’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions and subject to periodic reviews by ffiec regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks systems and data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses ransomware or malware cyberattacks and other means to date none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state federal and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present 

and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services if we are unable to obtain such services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

failures of third party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss jha relies on third party service providers to support key portions of its operations jha also relies on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services it delivers to customers while we have selected these third party vendors carefully we do not control their actions a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon jha’s delivery of its services to customers such a failure could lead to damages claims loss of customers and reputational harm depending on the duration and severity of the failure third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the third party vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations some of which are still being written the bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb was established which is implementing numerous new regulations applicable to “supervised service providers” such as the company these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cyber security program along with other compliance requirements the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies has created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all of the mandates in an efficient manner 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate 

resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions because our business is concentrated in financial institutions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard and similar organizations including the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications 

could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law could have an adverse impact to us unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately   5630  commercial and savings banks and more than   5680  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the past including the acquisition of ensenta corporation in december 2017 and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations   our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2018  on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  follows 

revenue 



services and support includes outsourcing and cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception product delivery  services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses implementation services consulting and hardware and inhouse support revenue which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms 

in the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  services and support revenue grew 7  over the prior fiscal year excluding deconversion fees which totaled 45537  in fiscal 2018  and 39516  in fiscal 2017  revenue from fiscal 2018  acquisitions totaling 8851  and fiscal 2017  revenue related to divestitures of 9188  services and support revenue grew 6  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in outsourcing and cloud revenue along with an increase in product delivery and services revenue resulting from completion of revised contractual obligations on several of our bundled arrangements 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and automated clearing house ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

processing revenue increased 9  for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  as compared to the fiscal year ended   june 30 2017  excluding 8294  of revenue from fiscal 2018  acquisitions and excluding fiscal 2017  revenue related to divestitures totaling 153  processing revenue increased 7  for the year with significant increases in each of its three components 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue increased compared to fiscal 2017  but remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue the increase was primarily due to a 6  expansion in headcount at june 30 2018  compared to june 30 2017  driving increased salaries and benefits other factors to the increase include higher amortization related to capitalized software higher direct costs of product and increased spending related to our strategic partnership with first data and pscu to expand our credit and debit card platform we also had other onetime expenses included in cost of revenue which totaled 3782  included in fiscal 2018  cost of sales fiscal 2017  cost of sales included an impairment loss of 3275  the company continues to focus on cost management 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased salary and benefit expenses in part due to a 4  increase in headcount but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 



selling general and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts commissions finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs these expenses increased primarily due to increased commissions salaries and professional service expenses due to contracting with outside experts in preparation for our adoption of the new accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue standard 

gains on disposal of businesses 

in fiscal 2018  we recognized gains on the disposal of businesses totaling 1894  due to the sales of our atm manager and jhadirect product lines in fiscal 2017  we recognized gains on the disposals of businesses totaling 3270  with 2136 related to the fiscal 2016 sale of alogent and 1134 related to the sale of our regulatory filing products 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense increased in fiscal 2018  due mainly to increased borrowing which was primarily used for the acquisition of ensenta corporation and has now been repaid 



the significant decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of the tcja enacted december 22 2017 which included a reduction to the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21  effective january 1 2018 a blended 28  us federal statutory income tax rate was applied to fiscal 2018  we recorded a net tax benefit of 94549  related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities and 23818  related to the impacts on current year operations 

net income 

net income increased 53  to 376660  or 485  per diluted share in fiscal 2018  from 245793  or 314  per diluted share in fiscal 2017  the significant increase is primarily attributable to the tcja excluding the 118367  of tax benefit recorded as a result of the tcja net income increased 5   and diluted earnings per share increased 6  for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

in fiscal 2017  revenues increased 6  or 76471  compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to strong growth in services and support revenue as discussed below 

operating expenses increased 7  partially due to the gain on the sale of our alogent business alogent in fiscal 2016  which is discussed below in the operating expenses section 

provision for income taxes increased 9  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  due a lower effective tax rate in the earlier year which is described in the following discussion 

the above changes resulted in a 1  decrease in net income for fiscal 2017  compared to the prior fiscal year 

revenue 



services and support includes outsourcing and cloud fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception product delivery  services revenue which includes revenue from the sales of licenses 

implementation services consulting and hardware and inhouse support revenue which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms 

fiscal 2017  services and support revenue grew 5  in fiscal 2017  despite alogent revenue totaling 28421  being included in fiscal 2016  excluding that headwind support and services grew 9  due mainly to an increase in outsourcing and cloud revenue along with an increase in product delivery and services revenue resulting from completion of revised contractual obligations on several of our bundled arrangements 



processing revenue includes remittance revenue from payment processing remote capture and automated clearing house ach transactions card fees including card transaction processing and monthly fees and transaction and digital revenue which includes transaction and mobile processing fees 

processing revenue increased 6  in fiscal 2017  with strong growth in each of its three components 

operating expenses 



cost of revenue for fiscal 2017  increased 6  compared to fiscal 2016  in line with the revenue increase and remained a consistent percentage of total revenue in each year 



research and development expenses increased primarily due to a 4 increase in headcount but were consistent 

with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 



selling general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2017  primarily due to increased commissions and headcount but decreased as a percentage of total revenue 

gain on disposal of businesses 

in fiscal 2017  we recognized gains on disposal of businesses totaling 3270  2136 was related to the sale of alogent and 1134 related to the sale of our regulatory filing products to fed reporter on may 1 2017 

in fiscal 2016  we sold our alogent business to antelope acquisition co an affiliate of battery ventures resulting in a gain of 19491  



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense remained low for both the current and prior years in line with our average debt balances in both years 



the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due fiscal 2016 s tax rate being reduced by the tax basis in excess of book basis in alogent stock at disposal 

net income 

net income decreased 1  to 245793  or 314  per diluted share in fiscal 2017  from 248867  or 312  per diluted share in fiscal 2016  this decrease was due to factors discussed above including the prior year alogent gain and lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2016  

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations   

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 jha changed its reportable segment structure from two customercentric segments bank and credit union to four productcentric segments the change was made based on the view of our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker that the company could be more effectively managed using a productcentric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration   

the company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments core payments complementary and corporate and other the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and maintain centralized customermember information the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services including atm debit and credit card processing services online and mobile bill pay solutions and risk management products and services the complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our core solutions or used independently the corporate  other segment includes hardware revenue and costs as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments   

the prior periods presented have been retroactively recast to conform to the new segment structure adopted july 1 2017 



in fiscal 2018  revenue in the core segment increased 10  compared to fiscal 2017  driven primarily by increases in both product delivery and services revenue and outsourcing and cloud revenue the increase in product delivery and services revenue was mainly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several longterm contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements cost of revenue for the core segment increased 10  for the yeartodate period 

in fiscal 2017  revenue in the core segment increased 12  due to increased support and service revenue driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream the increased product delivery and services revenue was partly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of 

revised contractual obligations on several longterm contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements cost of revenue increased 8  for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  



in fiscal 2018  revenue in the payments segment increased 7  compared to fiscal 2017  cost of revenue increased 9  for the fiscal yeartodate period partially due to increased headcount and amortization expenses related to ensenta as well as increased spending related to our strategic partnership with first data and pscu to expand our credit and debit card platform excluding deconversion fees from each period and ensenta revenue from fiscal 2018  along with related costs revenue increased 5  and costs of revenue also increased 5 

in fiscal 2017  revenue in the payments segment increased due primarily to increased card and remittance processing revenue compared to fiscal 2016  cost of revenue increased 4  



revenue in the complementary segment increased 7  for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  compared to the prior year the increase was driven by increased outsourcing and cloud services as well as increased transaction and digital processing excluding deconversion fees from each period and vanguard software group revenue from fiscal 2018  revenue increased 6  cost of revenue increased 6  but was a consistent percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  

in fiscal 2017  revenue in the complementary segment increased 10  the increase was primarily in our support and service revenue and was driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream the increased product delivery and services revenue was due in part to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several longterm contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements cost of revenue increased 7  for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  



revenue in the corporate and other segment for the fiscal year ended   june 30 2018  decreased mainly due to a loss of revenue from our jhadirect product line which was disposed near the beginning of fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2017  revenue from jhadirect totaled 6536 revenue classified in the corporate and other segment includes revenue from hardware and other products not specifically attributed to any of the other three segments 

the decreased revenue in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  in the corporate and other segment is largely due to alogent revenue of 28422  included in fiscal 2016  

cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 31440  at june 30 2018  from 114765  at june 30 2017  the decrease is primarily due to our acquisitions of vanguard software group and ensenta the latter of which was partially funded by borrowing on our revolving credit facility which has now been repaid 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities increased 15  compared to fiscal 2017  cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends repurchase stock and for capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018  totaled 291826  and included 137562  net of cash acquired for the purchases of ensenta corporation and vanguard software group 96647  for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 40135  mainly for the purchase of computer equipment 13138  for the purchase and development of internal use software and 5000  for the purchase of preferred stock of automated bookkeeping inc this was partially offset by 350  of proceeds from the sale of businesses and 306  of proceeds from asset sales 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017  totaled 141586  and included 89631  for the development of software capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 41947  mainly for the purchase of computer equipment and 16608  for the purchase and development of internal use software these expenditures were partially offset by 5632  of proceeds from the sale of businesses and 968  of proceeds from the sale of assets 

financing activities used cash of 203641  for fiscal 2018  cash used was 175000  for repayment on our revolving credit facility dividends paid to stockholders of 105021  and 48986  for the purchase of treasury shares these uses were partially offset by borrowings of 125000  on our revolving credit facility and 366  of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation 

financing activities used cash in fiscal 2017  of 171281  cash used was 130140  for the purchase of treasury shares dividends paid to stockholders of 91707  and repayments of the revolving credit facility and capital leases totaling 30200  this was partially offset by borrowings of 80000  and 766  of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation 

at june 30 2018  the company had negative working capital of 19360  however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 355538  which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements and deferred bundled product and service arrangements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we have access to remaining lines of credit in excess of 300000  we continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition 

capital requirements and resources 

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures totaling 40135  and 41947  for the twelve  months ending june 30 2018  and june 30 2017  respectively were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities these additions were funded from cash generated by operations at june 30 2018  the company had 2076  of material outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014 this standard is part of an effort to create a common revenue standard for us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition the new model enacts a fivestep process for achieving the core principle which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 the fasb also issued asu no 201514 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year but allows early application as of the original effective date we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early so the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201608 which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard additional updates including asu no 201610 asu no 201612 and asu no 201620 also address specific aspects of the new standard and are being considered entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods full retrospective or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption modified retrospective we plan to adopt the new standard using the full retrospective method     

the company has taken the following steps in evaluating and planning for the implementation of the new standard 



 determinations that have been made regarding the effect of the new standard are as follows 

 significant implementation matters still being addressed include 

 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases in february 2016 this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements specifically the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straightline basis asu no 201602 will be effective for jhas annual reporting period beginning july 1 2019 and early adoption is permitted at transition a modified retrospective approach must be utilized to measure leases as of the beginning of the earliest period presented however the fasb has provided certain practical expedients which the company is currently evaluating the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and when we will adopt it   

the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting in march 2016 the new standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting and presentation of sharebased payment transactions including reporting of excess tax benefits and shortfalls statutory minimum withholding considerations and classification within the statement of cash flows the standard allows a onetime accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate them asu no 201609 was effective for the company’s annual reporting period beginning july 1 2017 management elected to early adopt this standard as of july 1 2016 and has elected to continue our current practice of estimating forfeitures the adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements 



shares used to determine diluted earnings per share us gaap require us to use the treasury stock method the new standard requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in additional paidin capital these changes were applied on a prospective basis 

 asu 201615 issued by the fasb in august 2016 clarifies cash flow classification of eight specific cash flow issues and is effective for our annual reporting period beginning july 1 2018 we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early we do not expect any significant impact to our financial statements as a result of this standard 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with us gaap and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the sec the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license arrangements for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 

for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established 

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction 

for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control 

for our software licenses and related services including the software elements of multipleelement software and nonsoftware arrangements us gaap generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for standalone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation if the hours can be reasonably estimated vsoe of fair value is determined for postcontract support pcs based upon the price charged when sold separately for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements we have determined that vsoe cannot be established therefore revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs at that point the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products  services revenue within support  service revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

for arrangements that include specified upgrades such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered 

support and service fee revenue nonsoftware  maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year 

outsourced data processing and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross as we are the primary obligor in the contract with the customer the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers gross hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

revenuebased taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis ie excluded from revenues 

deferred costs 

costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties which are prepaid are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract generally one to five years with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues 

direct and incremental fulfillment costs associated with arrangements subject to asc 985605 for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985605 consist primarily of certain upfront costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 57 years these costs include commissions costs of thirdparty licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any longlived assets and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant estimates and assumptions include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no  outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2018  and are therefore not currently exposed to interest rate risk

 business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

 acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions including 29 acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

 we have completed one  acquisition in the last 3 years after 41  years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions

solutions 

our proprietary solutions are marketed through three business brands

 we will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels regularly updating and improving those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process ensuring compliance with relevant regulations updated with proven advances in technology and consistent with jha’s reputation as a premium product and service provider 

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in three  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs

electronic payment solutions 

electronic payment solutions provides our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovations with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing attract profitable retail and commercial accounts increase operating efficiencies comply with regulatory mandates and proactively mitigate and manage paymentsrelated risk 

jack henry identifies three components of electronic payment solutions 

 hardware systems 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation fulfilled directly and through ibm distributors and many other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers w e currently sell ibm power systems lenovo dell and hp servers and workstations canon digital check epson and panini check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

  

implementation and training 

the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 of the respective product’s software license fee the subsequent years service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2017  totaled 6303 million  consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of approximately 789 million  and 5514 million for outsourcing services approximately 4260 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2017 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2018 due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2016 totaled 6206 million  consisting of 956 million for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and 5250 million for outsourcing services 

the inhouse backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of june 30 2017  and 2016  

our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2018  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and the majority of our complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  were 848 million  812 million  and 715 million  respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  was 896 million  964 million  and 769 million  respectively 

sales and marketing 

jha serves established well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and crosssales opportunities 

the marketing and sales initiatives within the jack henry banking and symitar business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions profitstars sells specialized core agnostic niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters 

dedicated sales forces support each of jha’s three marketed brands sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services our sales professionals receive base salaries and performancebased commission compensation brandspecific sales support staff provide a variety of services including product and service demonstrations responses to prospectissued requestsforproposals and proposal and contract generation our marketing department supports all three brands with lead generation and brandbuilding activities including participation in statespecific regional and national trade shows print and online advertising telemarketing customer newsletters ongoing promotional campaigns and media relations jha also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services 

jha has sold select products and services in the caribbean canada europe and south america international sales account for less than   1  of jha’s total revenue in the year ended june 30 2017  and were approximately   1  of total revenue in fiscal years 2016  and 2015  

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various third parties to provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations some of which are still being written the consumer financial protection bureau was established which is implementing numerous new regulations applicable to “supervised service providers” such as the company these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions because our business is concentrated in financial institutions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard and similar organizations including the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of more than   5870  commercial and savings banks and more than   6000  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the past and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel 

and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations   our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30 2017  on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

from our revenue arrangements less predictable software license fees and hardware sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer which are not part of a bundled arrangement we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

nonbundled license revenue decreased due mainly to a reduction in standalone license sales in our bank segment with alogent headwinds accounting for 570  of that decrease excluding the alogent headwind license revenue decreased 3  such license fees will fluctuate as nonbundled license sales are sporadic in nature 



support and service revenues are generated from supporting our inhouse customers in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training and revenue from our bundled software multielement agreements there was growth in most support and service revenue components in fiscal 2017  despite alogent revenue of 27673  included in the prior year excluding that headwind support and services grew 9  

inhouse support and other services revenue increased despite headwinds of 13062  created from the alogent sale excluding the alogent headwind inhouse support and other services revenue increased 5  the increase was due mainly to increased revenue from work orders and from customers consulting with our client services consulting group the groups operational assessments help banks and credit unions maximize their operating efficiency and productivity identify new revenue and market opportunities and reduce costs 

electronic payment services continued to show growth over the prior year the revenue increases are mainly attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card risk management and transaction processing services remote capture and ach processing and online bill payment services deconversion fees fees charged when customer agreements are terminated prior to the end of their contracted term for electronic payment services decreased 2901  compared to the prior year excluding these fees from both years electronic payment services revenue increased 6  

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future the increase in outsourcing revenue was mainly due to data processing deconversion fees within outsourcing services increased 4736  excluding these fees from both years outsourcing services revenue increased 12  

implementation services include implementation services for our electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services merger conversion services image conversion services and network monitoring services implementation services revenue decreased due partly to alogent headwinds of 4465  with the remainder of the decrease due mainly to a decline in standalone implementations in the bank segment revenue from these standalone services has decreased as implementation services related to our bundled arrangements have increased 

bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements including license implementation services and maintenance which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value bundled products and services revenue increased despite 10145  of alogent headwinds mostly due to terminations of pending products and services on certain contracts that have allowed for the release of revenue that was being deferred until contract completion in both our bank and credit union core and complementary arrangements as well as increased revenue being released due to completion of final installations and services on our bank multiple element arrangements 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers and suppliers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased due to decreases in revenue from power systems servers and other complementary hardware products delivered although there will be quarterly fluctuations we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the general deflationary trend of computer prices 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from thirdparty vendors associated with nonbundled application software licenses these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized 

cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs were recognized as they were incurred or for direct costs associated with obtaining and implementing our bundled arrangements they were deferred and recognized ratably as the related revenues for these arrangements are recognized typically beginning when post contract support pcs is the only remaining undelivered element and ending at the end of the initial bundled pcs term 

cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consists of the direct costs of thirdparty software that are a part of a nonbundled arrangement sales of these thirdparty software products decreased compared to the last year shifts in sales mix between the products that make up these costs cause fluctuations in the margins from period to period 

cost of support and service for fiscal 2016  includes 12332 related to alogent sales excluding those costs our cost of support and service increased 8 gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the current period margins were lower due to decreased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products compared to the prior year 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional and national sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses increased compared to fiscal 2016  due mainly to increased commission expense but remained a consistent percentage of total revenue in both periods 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to a 4 increase in headcount but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 



general and administrative costs included all expenses related to finance legal and human resources plus all administrative costs these expenses increased primarily due to a 4 increase in headcount but were a consistent percentage of revenue in each year 

gains on disposal of businesses 

in fiscal 2017  we recognized gains on the disposals of businesses totaling 3270  2136  was related to last years sale of alogent and 1134  related to the sale of our regulatory filing products to fed reporter on may 1 2017 in fiscal 2016  we had a gain totaling 19491  due to the sale of alogent 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense remained low for both the current and prior years in line with our average debt balances in both years 



the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due the prior years rate being reduced by the tax basis in excess of book basis in alogent stock at disposal 

net income 

net income decreased 1  to 245793  or 314  per diluted share in fiscal 2017  from 248867  or 312  per diluted share in fiscal 2016  this decrease was due to factors discussed above including the prior year alogent gain and lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2016  

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

in fiscal 2016  revenues increased 8  or 98456  compared to fiscal 2015  due primarily to strong growth in our support and service revenues particularly outsourcing services bundled services and electronic payment services cost of sales increased just 7  contributing to an 8  increase in gross profit 

net operating expenses increased 1  and the provision for income taxes increased 6  compared to fiscal 2015  the increased revenue and above changes resulted in a combined 18  increase in net income for fiscal 2016  compared to the prior fiscal year 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer which are not part of a bundled arrangement we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

nonbundled license revenue increased due mainly to an increase in standalone license sales in our bank segment such license fees will fluctuate as nonbundled license sales are sporadic in nature 





support and service revenues are generated from supporting our customers in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services implementation service including conversion installation configuration and training and revenue from our bundled software multielement agreements there was growth in most support and service revenue components in fiscal 2016  

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance renewal fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers’ assets grow and new customers began renewing their annual maintenance increased software usage revenue from alogent mobile remote deposits also contributed to the increase 

electronic payment services continued to show growth over the prior year although that growth slowed due to some of our large customers being acquired and price compression on contract renewals in our card services offerings the 

revenue increases are mainly attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card transaction processing services online bill payment services and ach processing deconversion revenue for electronic payment services increased 9616  over the prior year excluding these fees we had a 4  increase in electronic payment services revenue 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future 

implementation services include implementation services for our electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services merger conversion services image conversion services and network monitoring services implementation services revenue decreased due to a decrease in standalone implementations in the bank segment revenue from these standalone services has decreased as implementation services related to our bundled arrangements have increased 

bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements including license implementation services and maintenance which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value bundled products and services revenue increased over last year mainly due to increased revenues from our core and complementary credit union arrangements 26567  of the increase was due to terminations of minor pending products and services on certain contracts that have allowed for the release of revenue that was being deferred until contract completion in both our credit union and bank core and complementary arrangements 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in complementary hardware products delivered although there will be quarterly fluctuations we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the general deflationary trend of computer prices 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from thirdparty vendors through remarketing agreements associated with nonbundled application software licenses these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized 

cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs were recognized as they were incurred or for direct costs associated with obtaining and implementing our bundled arrangements they are deferred and recognized ratably as the related revenues for these arrangements are recognized typically beginning when pcs is the only remaining undelivered element and ending at the end of the initial bundled pcs term 

cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consisted of the direct costs of thirdparty software that was part of a nonbundled arrangement sales of these thirdparty software products increased slightly in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  shifts in sales mix between the products that make up these costs cause fluctuations in the margins from period to period 

gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year 

in general changes in cost of hardware trended consistently with hardware revenue for fiscal year 2016  margins were slightly higher due to increased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products than in the prior year 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conducted our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and were overseen by regional and national sales managers our sales executives were responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurtured longterm relationships with our client base and cross sold our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2016  increased slightly compared to fiscal 2015  due to increased salary expense but remained a consistent percentage of total revenue in both periods 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings 

research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2016  over the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 



general and administrative costs included all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs these costs increased in fiscal 2016  primarily due to increased headcount and related salaries but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue 

gain on disposal of businesses 

in fiscal 2016  we had a gain totaling 19491  due to the sale of our alogent business to antelope acquisition co an affiliate of battery ventures in fiscal 2015  we sold the teleweb™ suite of internet and mobile banking software products to data center inc dci resulting in a gain of 6874  



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense remained low for both years 



the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due a significant difference in the book versus tax basis in alogent stock as well as the retroactive permanent extension of the research and experimentation credit re credit to january 1 2015 during fiscal 2016 

net income 

net income increased from 211221  or 259  per diluted share in fiscal 2015  to 248867  or 312  per diluted share in fiscal 2016  this translates to an increase of 18  in net income 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations the company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments bank systems and services “bank” and credit union systems and services “credit union” the company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors including prospects for growth return on investment and return on revenue 



in fiscal 2017  revenue in the bank segment increased 6 compared to the prior fiscal year despite revenue headwinds of 28422  due to the sale of alogent the increase was due to a 7 increase in support and service revenue partially offset by decreased hardware and standalone license sales the increase in support and service revenue was driven by increases in the outsourcing services electronic payment services and bundled products and services revenue streams those increases were partly offset by decreased revenue from inhouse support and other services and 

implementation services due mainly to the alogent headwinds gross profit margin remained consistent with fiscal 2016  

in fiscal 2016  revenue in the bank segment increased 4  compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to a 12 increase in outsourcing services gross profit margins decreased only slightly compared to fiscal 2015  



in fiscal 2017  revenue in the credit union segment increased 5  due to increases in support  service revenue totaling 6 partially offset by decreased hardware and standalone license revenue support  service revenues grew through increases in bundled services inhouse maintenance renewals and outsourcing services partly offset by decreased electronic payment services and implementation services revenue the increase in bundled services was due to an increase in terminations of pending products and service obligations on certain contracts allowing for earlier recognition of revenue on our bundled arrangements the decrease in electronic payment services revenue was mainly due to decreased deconversion fees and decreased revenue from card manufacturing gross profit margin for the credit union segment increased 1  

in fiscal 2016  revenue in the credit union segment increased 22  due to increases in support  service revenue support  service revenues grew 22 through increases in electronic payment services inhouse maintenance renewals and bundled services gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased 2  mainly due to economies of scale realized from growing transaction volume in our payment processing services

recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014 this standard is part of an effort to create a common revenue standard for us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition the new model enacts a fivestep process for achieving the core principle which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 the fasb also issued asu no 201514 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year but allows early application as of the original effective date we do not intend to adopt the provisions of the new standard early so the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201608 which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard asu no 201610 asu no 201612 and asu no 201620 also address specific aspects of the new standard entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance including which transition approach will be applied and continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard we expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our revenue recognition currently subject to accounting standards codification asc topic 985 we are currently in the process of implementing and testing new software to assist in applying the fivestep model to our various revenue streams and comparing the results to our current accounting practices one of the most significant expected impacts relates to the recognition of license and implementation revenue on our multielement arrangements we expect to recognize license and install revenue at the time of the install completion rather than over the maintenance period of the software on our multielement agreements we expect revenue related to hardware outlink contracts payment processing and professional services to remain substantially unchanged   

the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases in february 2016 this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements asu no 201602 will be effective for jack henrys annual reporting period beginning july 1 2019 and early adoption is permitted the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements   

the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting in march 2016 the new standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting and presentation of sharebased payment transactions including reporting of excess tax benefits and shortfalls statutory minimum withholding considerations and classification within the statement of cash flows the standard allows a onetime accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate them asu no 201609 is effective for the company’s annual reporting period beginning july 1 2017 management elected to early adopt this standard as of july 1 2016 and has elected to continue our current practice of estimating forfeitures the adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our condensed consolidated financial statements   



would have been recognized in additional paidin capital these changes were applied on a prospective basis 

 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license arrangements for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 

for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established 

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction 

for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control 

for our software licenses and related services including the software elements of multipleelement software and nonsoftware arrangements us gaap generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for standalone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation if the hours can be reasonably estimated vsoe of fair value is determined for post 

contract support pcs based upon the price charged when sold separately for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements we have determined that vsoe cannot be established therefore revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs at that point the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products  services revenue within support  service revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

for arrangements that include specified upgrades such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered 

support and service fee revenue nonsoftware  maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year 

outsourced data processing and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross as we are the primary obligor in the contract with the customer the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers gross hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

revenuebased taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis ie excluded from revenues 

deferred costs 

costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties which are prepaid are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract generally one to five years with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues 

direct and incremental fulfillment costs associated with arrangements subject to accounting standards codification asc 985605 for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985605 consist primarily of certain upfront costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 57 years these costs include commissions costs of thirdparty licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any longlived assets and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant estimates and assumptions include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization 

period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value thirdparty valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2017  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase interest expense by 500  on an annual basis

 business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 



 acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions including 29 acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

 we have completed two acquisitions in the last 3 years after 40 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders such as repurchases of our stock and continued payment of dividends 

our five most recent acquisitions were 



solutions 

our proprietary solutions are marketed through three business brands 



operating environments and include proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth increasing security and mitigating operational risks andor controlling operating costs profitstars’ products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and diverse corporate entities with nearly   10200  domestic and international customers these distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems or needs and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends 

we will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels regularly enhancing those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process compliant with relevant regulations updated with proven advances in technology and consistent with jha’s reputation as a premium product and service provider 

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in three  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs 

jha regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities mitigating and controlling operational risks and containing costs the company’s industry research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings and manages the introduction of new product offerings jha’s new complementary products and services are developed internally acquired or provided through strategic alliances 

electronic payment services 

electronic payment services supports our customers with convenient and secure payment processing designed to help them simplify complex payment processing attract profitable retail and commercial accounts increase operating efficiencies comply with regulatory mandates and proactively mitigate and manage paymentsrelated risk and fraud while staying at the forefront of payments innovation 

jack henry identifies three components of electronic payment services 

 hardware systems 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation fulfilled directly and through ibm distributors avnet inc and other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers we currently sell the ibm power systems lenovo servers and workstations dell servers and workstations burroughs rdm panini digital check canon check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

implementation and training 

the majority of our new core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2016  totaled 6206 million  consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of approximately 956 million  and 5250 million for outsourcing services approximately 4060 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2016 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2017 due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2015 totaled 5278 million  consisting of 963 million for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and 4315 million for outsourcing services 

the inhouse backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of june 30 2016  and 2015  

our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2017  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and the majority of our complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  were 812 million  715 million  and 667 million  respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  was 964 million  769 million  and 622 million  respectively 

sales and marketing 

jha serves established well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and crosssales opportunities 

jack henry banking sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions primarily to domestic commercial banks with assets up to 30 billion  symitar sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions primarily to domestic credit unions of all asset sizes the marketing and sales initiatives within these business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions profitstars sells specialized niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters 

dedicated sales forces support each of jha’s three business brands sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services our sales professionals receive base salaries and performancebased commission compensation brandspecific sales support staff provide a variety of services including product and service demonstrations responses to prospectissued requestsforproposals and proposal and contract generation our marketing department supports all three business lines with lead generation and brandbuilding activities including participation in statespecific regional and national trade shows print and online advertising telemarketing customer newsletters ongoing promotional campaigns and media relations jha also hosts annual national user group meetings which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and dh corporation profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications 

for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our company’s source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

regulatory compliance 

jha maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by the federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given jha’s compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience and a thorough working knowledge of jha and our solutions these compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements including regular discussions on emerging topics with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations 

jha has a process to inform internal departments of new and revised regulatory requirements upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the company’s productspecific change control boards and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle a representative of jha’s compliance organization serves on every change control board to ensure that the regulatory perspective is addressed in proposed productservice changes we publish newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations periodically customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes 

internal audits of our systems networks operations business recovery plans and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems processes plans and security ensuring that confidential information remains private is a high priority and jha’s initiatives to protect confidential information include regular thirdparty application reviews intended to better secure information access additional thirdparty reviews are performed throughout the organization such as vulnerability tests intrusion tests and statement on standards for attestation engagements ssae 16 reviews the ffiec conducts annual reviews throughout the company and issues reports that are reviewed by the jha risk and compliance committee of the board of directors 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation all financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers including but not limited to those mandated by federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules the privacy of consumer financial information regulations usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the grammleachbliley act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the compliance of jha’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design the classification of customers and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services the impact of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act is still evolving as the regulations are written to implement the various provisions of the law we cannot predict the impact these regulations any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future 

jha is not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions however operating as a service provider to financial institutions jha’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions and subject to periodic reviews by ffiec regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we 

may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in june 2015   we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september 30 2014 for the years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 and 2013 the restated periods the determination to restate the financial statements for the restated periods was made upon the identification of errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multielement agreements in connection with the consolidated financial statements for the year ending june 30 2016 management believes that the identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting were fully remediated 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions because our business is concentrated in financial institutions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals we have recently completed a planned transition of chief executive officer from jack prim to david foss a senior executive with long company tenure if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations some of which are still being written the consumer financial protection bureau was established which is implementing numerous new regulations applicable to “supervised service providers” such as the company these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard and similar organizations including the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately 6100  commercial and savings banks and 6300  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the past and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer 

the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations   our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 38 of our total assets at june 30 2016 on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results

a significant proportion of our revenue is derived from recurring outsourcing fees and electronic payment transaction processing fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception support and service fees also include inhouse maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms implementation services revenue and bundled services revenue which is a combination of license implementation and maintenance revenue 

from our revenue arrangements less predictable software license fees and hardware sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

during the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 1017667  in fiscal 2012  to  1354646  in fiscal 2016  income from continuing operations has grown from 152040  in fiscal 2012  to 248867  in fiscal 2016  this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer which are not part of a bundled arrangement we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

nonbundled license revenue increased due mainly to an increase in standalone license sales in our banking segment such license fees will fluctuate as nonbundled license sales are sporadic in nature 



support and service revenues are generated from supporting our customers in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training and revenue from our bundled software multielement agreements there was growth in most support and service revenue components in fiscal 2016  

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance renewal fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers’ assets grow and new customers began renewing their annual maintenance increased software usage revenue from alogent mobile remote deposits also contributed to the increase 

electronic payment services continued to show growth over the prior year although that growth slowed due to some of our large customers being acquired and price compression on contract renewals in our card services offerings the revenue increases are mainly attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card transaction processing services online bill payment services and ach processing deconversion revenue for electronic payment services increased 9617 over the prior year excluding these fees we had a 4 increase in electronic payment services revenue 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future 

implementation services include implementation services for our electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services merger conversion services image conversion services and network monitoring services implementation services revenue decreased due to a decrease in standalone implementations in the banking segment revenue from these standalone services has decreased as implementation services related to our bundled arrangements have increased 

 bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements including license implementation services and maintenance which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value bundled products and services revenue increased over last year mainly due to increased revenues from our core and complementary credit union arrangements 26567 of the increase was due to terminations of minor pending products and services on certain contracts that have allowed for the release of revenue that was being deferred until contract completion in both our credit union and banking core and complementary arrangements 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers and suppliers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in complementary hardware products delivered although there will be quarterly fluctuations we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the general deflationary trend of computer prices 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors associated with nonbundled application software licenses these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized

cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consists of the direct costs of third party software that are a part of a nonbundled arrangement sales of these third party software products increased slightly compared to the last year shifts in sales mix between the products that make up these costs cause fluctuations in the margins from period to period 

gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year

operating expenses

selling and marketing expenses increased slightly compared to fiscal 2015  due to increased salary expense but remained a consistent percentage of total revenue in both periods 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue

interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense remained low for both the current and prior years in line with our debt balances in both years

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 70310  at june 30 2016  from 148313  at june 30 2015  the decrease from june 30 2015 is primarily due to repayments on our revolving credit facility and repurchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2016 partially offset by increased net income and proceeds from the disposal of a business 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities decreased 2  compared to this fiscal 2015  due mainly to increased income tax payments cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends repurchase stock and for capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016  totaled 135963  and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 56325  which was mainly for the purchase of computer equipment and aircraft 96411  for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product offerings 8275  for the acquisition of bayside business solutions net of cash acquired and 11826  for the purchase and development of internal use software this was

at june 30 2016  the company had negative working capital of 11803  however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 343525  which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements and deferred bundled product and service arrangements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we have access to remaining lines of credit in excess of 300000  we continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license arrangements for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 

for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established 

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction 

for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control 

for our software licenses and related services including the software elements of multipleelement software and nonsoftware arrangements us gaap generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for standalone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation if the hours can be reasonably estimated vsoe of fair value is determined for postcontract support pcs based upon the price charged when sold separately for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements we have determined that vsoe cannot be established therefore revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs at that point the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products  services revenue within support  service revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

for arrangements that include specified upgrades such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered 

support and service fee revenue nonsoftware  maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year 

outsourced data processing and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers gross hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

revenuebased taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis ie excluded from revenues 

deferred costs 

costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties which are prepaid are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract generally one to five years with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues 

direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements subject to accounting standards codification asc 985605 for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985605 consist primarily of certain upfront costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 57 years these costs include commissions costs of thirdparty licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any longlived assets and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant estimates and assumptions include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment cost incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 

for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life 

a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable 

income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2016  and are therefore not currently exposed to interest risk

the management’s report on internal control over financial reporting required by this item 9a is in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” the companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016  their report is included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation of prior period material weakness 

as of june 30 2015 we reported a material weakness in our controls over revenue recognition a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

there were a number of deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting that in the aggregate constituted a material weakness the material weakness resulted from a failure in the companys risk assessment process wherein the risk assessment process did not identify or evaluate the inherent risks and complexities associated with accounting for revenue arrangements with software elements to remediate the material weakness reported in the form 10k for the year ended june 30 2015 we designed and implemented new controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to apply proper revenue recognition accounting under asc 985 and asc 605 

the company successfully completed documentation and the testing of the new and enhanced controls and as of june 30 2016  has concluded that the material weakness has been remediated 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as noted in the remediation of prior period material weakness section above there has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

we have restated our prior consolidated financial statements which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10ka we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 and 2013 the restated periods the determination to restate the financial statements for the restated periods was made by our audit committee upon management’s recommendation following the identification of errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multielement agreements due to the errors our management concluded that the companys previously issued financial statements for the restated periods should no longer be relied upon our annual report on form 10k for the year ended june 30 2014 has been amended by this amendment no 1 on form 10ka to among other things reflect the restatement of our financial statements for the restated periods as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this amendment no 1 to form 10k 

as a result of these events we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the risk of potential stockholder litigation if lawsuits are filed we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of such litigation likewise such events might cause a diversion of our management’s time and attention if we do not prevail in any such litigation we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in addition the restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could if not remediated result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as disclosed in item 9a of this form 10ka management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting based upon our identification of certain errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multielement agreements a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2014 our annual report on form 10k for the year ended june 30 2014 has been amended by this amendment no 1 on form 10ka to among other things reflect the change in managements conclusion regarding the 

effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2014 as discussed in item 8 and item 9a of this form 10ka 

we are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect the companys business and results of operations or financial condition restrict its ability to access the capital markets require the company to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject it to fines penalties or judgments harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence 

  operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in 2012 we experienced a disruption to our operations at our lyndhurst nj processing center as a result of super storm sandy any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house  “ ach ”  payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software 

and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in december 2013 we entered into an agreement with the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal reserve bank of st louis which together regulate the companys operations as the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec in 2012 operations at the companys lyndhurst nj processing center were temporarily but significantly disrupted by super storm sandy impacting the financial institutions served by that facility until the company was able to return to normal operations the agreement commits the company to a process of assessing improving and monitoring its disaster recovery and business continuity plans and the management of related risks across the company the agreement also commits the company to a process of reporting on corrective actions and to monitoring of its compliance with applicable regulations and guidance from the regulators and the ffiec regular reports of progress have been made to clients and to the regulators the company has met all of the deadlines stipulated in the agreement and continues to mature the identified processes with the objective of achieving full compliance we are unable to predict what effect if any this agreement will have on our business failure to comply with the agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations many of which are still being written these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately 6800  commercial and savings banks and 6800  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the last decade and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory    and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with 

the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

in fiscal 2014  revenues increased 6  or 65649  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which has resulted in a 7  increase in gross profit 

operating expenses decreased 2  for the year mainly due to 12436  of expenses in the prior year related to the impact of hurricane sandy flooding on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center provision for income taxes increased over the prior year the prior year provision for income tax was low due to the tax impact of the lyndhurst new jersey expenses and the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits increased revenue and gross margin coupled with the above changes resulted in a combined 11  increase in net income for fiscal 2014  

we move into fiscal 2015 following record revenue achieved in fiscal 2014 significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer that are not part of a bundled arrangement we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

nonbundled license revenue decreased due mainly to a decrease in standalone license sales in our banking segment such license fees will fluctuate as nonbundled license sales are sporadic in nature 



support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training and revenue from our bundled software multielement agreements 

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance renewal fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers’ assets grow the increase compared to the prior year was consistent across all four fiscal quarters 

electronic payment services continue to experience the largest dollar growth the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card transaction processing services online bill payment services and ach processing the increase compared to the prior year was consistent across all four fiscal quarters 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services include implementation services for our outsourcing and electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services merger conversion services image conversion services and network monitoring services implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our credit union core products particularly in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 

bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements including license implementation services and maintenance which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value bundled products and services revenue decreased from last year mainly due to decreased revenues from our core and complementary banking products particularly image solutions throughout the fiscal year additionally the decrease was furthered due to a decrease in core credit union products in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased slightly although there will be continuing quarterly fluctuations we expect there to be an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the general deflationary trend of computer prices 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with nonbundled application software licenses these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs were recognized as they were incurred or for direct costs associated with obtaining and implementing our bundled arrangements deferred and recognized ratably as the related revenues for these arrangements are recognized which typically begins when pcs is the only remaining undelivered element and ends at the end of the initial bundled pcs term cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consists of the direct costs of third party software sales of third party software products increased compared to last year causing a decrease in gross profit margins 

gross profit margins in support and service increased due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues particularly in electronic payment services although margins fluctuated slightly throughout the quarters of the current fiscal year due to sales mix the trend in electronic payment services was consistent through all four quarters 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year margins are slightly lower due to decreased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for the year increased mainly due to higher commission expenses and a general increase in sales headcount and related salaries this is in line with increased sales volume of long term service contracts on which commissions are paid as a percentage of total revenue and was consistent across all quarters of the fiscal year 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased headcount and related salaries with all quarters in the fiscal year being driven by a 6 increase in headcount in the first quarter 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs 

general and administrative expenses in the current year includes 2900 in the second quarter for insurance recoveries of costs related to the impact of hurricane sandy flooding on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center whereas the prior year mostly the second quarter includes 12436  of expenses related to the same event general and administrative expenses excluding the lyndhurst expenses and subsequent insurance recoveries increased slightly yearoveryear due to additional headcount and related salaries

the provision for income taxes was 100855  or 351  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2014  compared with 77450  or 316  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2013  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the prior year following the close of an internal revenue service audit of fiscal years 2010 and 2011 as well as the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credit during the prior year 

net income 

net income increased from 167610  or 194  per diluted share in fiscal 2013  to 186715  or 219  per diluted share in fiscal 2014  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 revenues increased 9  or 89857  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which resulted in a 10  increase in gross profit 

operating expenses increased 13  for the year mainly due to expenses related to the impact of widespread flooding caused by hurricane sandy on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center expenses related to this event totaled 12475 for fiscal 2013 net of 2390 insurance recoveries received in the year 

increased revenue and gross margins partially offset by increased operating expenses resulted in a combined 10  increase in net income for fiscal 2013

bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements including license implementation services and maintenance which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value bundled products and services decreased from last year mainly due to decreased revenues from our core and complementary banking products consistent across all quarters of the fiscal year and decreased revenues from our suite of remote deposit capture particularly in the third and fourth quarters compared to the prior fiscal year 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

cost of license consisted of the direct costs of third party software sales of third party software products decreased compared to the prior year leading to lower related costs and increased gross profit margins 

gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year 

in general changes in cost of hardware trended consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year margins decreased slightly impacted by reduced sales of higher margin products related to hardware upgrades

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a provider of integrated computer systems that perform data processing available for inhouse installations or outsourced services for banks and credit unions the company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments bank systems and services “bank” and credit union systems and services “credit union” the company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors including prospects for growth return on investment and return on revenue 



in fiscal 2014 revenue increased 7  overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to increased support and service revenue within support and service revenue the increase was driven by 12 yearoveryear growth in electronic payment services revenues from transaction processing and a 10 increase in outsourcing services revenue gross profit margins remain consistent yearoveryear 

in fiscal 2013 revenue increased 8 overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to 17 growth in electronic transaction processing services and an 11 increase in outsourcing services gross profit margins remained consistent yearoveryear 



in fiscal 2014 revenue in the credit union segment increased 3  over the prior year driven by support  service revenue in particular electronic payment services increased due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and inhouse maintenance renewal revenues also increased gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due to economies of scale realized from growing transaction volume in our payment processing services 

in fiscal 2013 revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment increased due to increases in support  service revenue support  service revenues grew 13 through increases in all components particularly electronic payment services due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and outsourcing services gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due to increased support and service margins due to economies of scale realized 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future 

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 70377  at june 30 2014  from 127905  at june 30 2013  the decrease from june 30 2013 is primarily due to the banno acquisition and ongoing purchases of treasury stock 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities increased 11  compared to last year cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends repurchase stock and other capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 totaled 131780  and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 33185  which mainly included the purchase of aircraft and computer equipment other uses of cash included 27894  of payments for the acquisition of banno 62194  for the development of software and 16288  for the purchase and development of internal use software these expenditures have been partially offset by 7781  proceeds received primarily from sale of aircraft cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 totaled 97244 and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment totaled 46256 which included spending on our online bill payment data center migration and an aircraft purchase other uses of cash included 51332 for the development of software and 186 for the acquisition of customer contracts these expenditures were partially offset by 530 proceeds from sale of assets 

financing activities used cash of 267407  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 cash used was mainly dividends paid to stockholders of 71251  175699  for the purchase of treasury shares and repayments of capital leases of 22158 cash used was partially offset by 1701  net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation during the fourth quarter the company also borrowed 25000  against its revolving line of credit 

and the full amount of the borrowing was repaid in the same period financing activities used cash of 241338 during fiscal 2013 there were cash outflows to repay long and short term borrowings on our credit facilities of 145180 dividends paid to stockholders of 48202 and repurchases of treasury shares of 58126 cash used was partially offset by 10170 net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation 

at june 30 2014 the company had negative working capital of 56303  however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 337493  which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements and deferred bundled product and service arrangements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we continue to have access to unused lines of credit in excess of 150000  and continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition 

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures in the fiscal year were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities these additions were funded from cash generated by operations at june 30 2014 the company had 24223  of purchase commitments related to property and equipment we anticipate that these commitments will be funded by cash generated by operations 

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facilities the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2014  there were 19795  shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 5196  additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2014  is 577781  during fiscal 2014  the company repurchased 3041  treasury shares for 175699  at june 30 2013  there were 16754  shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 8237  additional shares 

on august 22 2014  the companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of 022 per share on its common stock payable on september 26 2014 to shareholders of record on september 5 2014  current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the companys financial picture continues to be favorable 

capital leases 

the company has entered into various capital lease obligations for the use of certain computer equipment long term capital lease obligations were entered into of which 7757  remains outstanding at june 30 2014  and 4028  will be maturing within the next twelve months the company also has short term capital lease obligations totaling 1379  at june 30 2014  included in property and equipment are assets under capital leases totaling 37316  which have accumulated depreciation totaling 7994  

other lines of credit 

the long term revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to 150000  which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to 250000  the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to a a rate based on libor or b an alternate base rate the greater of a the federal funds rate plus 05  b the prime rate or c libor plus 10  plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the companys leverage ratio the credit facility is secured by pledges of capital stock of certain subsidiaries of the company and also guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement as of june 30 2014  the company was in compliance with all such covenants the revolving loan terminates june 4 2015  and at june 30 2014  there was no  outstanding revolving loan balance 

the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on march 3 2014  which provides for funding of up to 5000  and bears interest at the prime rate less 1  the credit line was renewed through april 30 2017  at june 30 2014  no  amount was outstanding 

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

at june 30 2014  the company’s total off balance sheet contractual obligations were 55370  this balance consists of 31147  of longterm operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2015  to 2021  and 24223  of purchase commitments related to property and equipment the contractual obligations table below excludes 8620  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 



recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014 the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license arrangements for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 

for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established 

the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction 

for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within the vendor’s control 

for our software licenses and related services including the software elements of multipleelement software and nonsoftware arrangements us gaap generally require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for standalone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation if the hours can be reasonably estimated vsoe of fair value is determined for postcontract support pcs based upon the price charged when sold separately for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements we have determined that vsoe cannot be established therefore revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs at that point the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized to bundled products  services revenue within support  service revenue in the income statement 

for arrangements that include specified upgrades such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered 

support and service fee revenue nonsoftware  maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year 

outsourced data processing and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

revenuebased taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis ie excluded from revenues 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products significant estimates and assumptions include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an 

individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

 business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

 acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions including 28 material acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

 we have only completed one acquisition since fiscal year 2010 after 38 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position to the benefit of our shareholders such as repurchases of jkhy stock and payment of dividends 

our four most recent acquisitions were

 we will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels regularly enhanced using an interactive customer enhancement process compliant with relevant regulations updated with proven advances in technology and consistent with jha’s reputation as a premium product and service provider 

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two functionally distinct core credit union platforms are

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in three  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from two  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs 

jha regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities mitigating and controlling operational risks and containing costs the company’s industry research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings and manages the introduction of new product offerings jha’s new complementary products and services are developed internally acquired or provided through strategic alliances 

hardware systems 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation avnet inc and other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware at a discount and resell it directly to our customers we currently sell the ibm power systems and system x servers lenovo workstations dell servers and workstations burroughs rdm panini digital check canon check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

implementation and training 

the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their inhouse systems 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system being implemented our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

implementation and training services also are provided in connection with new customers outsourcing their information processing to jha 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 percent of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2014  totaled 5132 million  consisting of 1187 million  for inhouse products and services and 3945 million  for outsourcing services approximately 3000 million  of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2014  is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2015  due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2013  totaled 4988 million  consisting of 1058 million  for inhouse products and services and 3930 million  for outsourcing services 

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2014  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually 

evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  were 667 million  632 million  and 609 million  respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  was 622 million  513 million  and 379 million  respectively 

sales and marketing 

jha serves established well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and crosssales opportunities 

jack henry banking sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions to domestic commercial banks with assets up to 300 billion symitar sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions to domestic credit unions of all asset sizes the marketing and sales initiatives within these business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions profitstars sells specialized niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and dh corporation profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our company’s source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

regulatory compliance 

jha maintains a strict corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by the federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given jha’s comprehensive compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience and a thorough working knowledge of jha and our solutions these compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements including regular discussions on emerging topics with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations 

jha has a proven process to inform internal departments of new and revised regulatory requirements upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the company’s productspecific change control boards and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle a representative of jha’s compliance organization serves on every change control board to ensure that the regulatory perspective is addressed in proposed productservice changes we publish newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations periodically customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes such as recent changes mortgage servicing rules promulgated by the consumer financial protection bureau 

internal audits of our systems networks operations business recovery plans and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems processes plans and security ensuring that confidential information remains private is a high priority and jha’s initiatives to protect confidential information include regular thirdparty application reviews intended to better secure information access additional thirdparty reviews are performed throughout the organization such as vulnerability tests intrusion tests and ssae 16 reviews the ffiec conducts annual reviews throughout the company and issues reports that are reviewed by the jha audit committee of the board of directors 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation all financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision with increased attention to consumer regulations with the addition of the consumer financial protection bureau our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers including but not limited to those mandated by federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules the privacy of consumer financial information regulations usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the grammleachbliley act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the compliance of jha’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design the classification of customers and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services the impact of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act is still evolving as the regulations are written to implement the various provisions of the law we cannot predict the impact these regulations any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future 

jha is not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions however operating as a service provider to financial institutions jha’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions and subject to periodic reviews by ffiec regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

  operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in 2012 we experienced a disruption to our operations at our lyndhurst nj processing center as a result of super storm sandy any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house  “ ach ”  payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment 

worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations 

in december 2013 we entered into an agreement with the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal reserve bank of st louis which together regulate the companys operations as the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec in 2012 operations at the companys lyndhurst nj processing center were temporarily but significantly disrupted by super storm sandy impacting the financial institutions served by that facility until the company was able to return to normal operations the agreement commits the company to a process of assessing improving and monitoring its disaster recovery and business continuity plans and the management of related risks across the company the agreement also commits the company to a process of reporting on corrective actions and to monitoring of its compliance with applicable regulations and guidance from the regulators and the ffiec regular reports of progress have been made to clients and to the regulators the company has met all of the deadlines stipulated in the agreement and continues to mature the identified processes with the objective of achieving full compliance we are unable to predict what effect if any this agreement will have on our business failure to comply with the agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations many of which are still being written these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately 6800  commercial and savings banks and 6800  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the last decade and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory    and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial 

institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following section provides managements view of the financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

overview 

jack henry  associates inc jha is headquartered in monett missouri employs approximately 5600  associates nationwide and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations its solutions serve nearly   11300  customers and are marketed and supported through three primary brands jack henry banking® supports banks ranging from community to midtier multibillion dollar institutions with information and transaction processing solutions symitar® is a leading provider of information and transaction processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes profitstars® provides specialized products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry to mitigate and control risks optimize revenue and growth opportunities and contain costs jhas integrated solutions are available for inhouse installation and outsourced and hosted delivery 

each of our brands share the fundamental commitment to provide high quality business solutions service levels that consistently exceed customer expectations integration of solutions and practical new technologies the quality of our solutions our high service standards and the fundamental way we do business typically foster longterm customer relationships attract prospective customers and have enabled us to capture substantial market share 

through internal product development disciplined acquisitions and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new crosssales opportunities across our three business brands we provide compatible computer hardware for our inhouse installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced and hosted solutions we perform data conversions software implementations initial and ongoing customer training and ongoing customer support services 

our primary competitive advantage is customer service our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels we believe to be the highest in the markets we serve and generate high levels of customer satisfaction and retention we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and random surveys we receive in our everyday business dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience including product implementation education and consulting services 

the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring outsourcing fees and transaction processing fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception support and service fees also include inhouse maintenance fees on primarily annual contract terms less predictable software license fees and hardware 

sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

during the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 836586  in fiscal 2010  to 1210053  in fiscal 2014  income from continuing operations has grown from 117870  in fiscal 2010  to 201136  in fiscal 2014  this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion 

we have two reportable segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales 

we continue to focus on our objective of providing the best integrated solutions products and customer service to our clients we are cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect our clients to continue investing in our products and services to improve their operating efficiencies and performance we anticipate that consolidation within the financial services industry will continue regulatory conditions and legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act will continue to impact the financial services industry and could motivate some financial institutions to postpone discretionary spending 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  and compare fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2012  

results of operations 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013   

in fiscal 2014  revenues increased 7  or 80667  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which has resulted in a 9  increase in gross profit 

operating expenses decreased 2  for the year mainly due to 12436  of expenses in the prior year related to the impact of hurricane sandy flooding on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center provision for income taxes increased over the prior year the prior year provision for income tax was low due to the tax impact of the lyndhurst new jersey expenses and the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits increased revenue and gross margin coupled with the above changes resulted in a combined 14  increase in net income for fiscal 2014  

we move into fiscal 2015 following record revenue achieved in fiscal 2014 significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

license revenue decreased slightly due mainly to a decrease in license revenue from complementary products particularly our remote deposit capture suite of products 

while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital investment in license fees we expect this trend to continue in the long term 



support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services and implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training there was growth in all support and service revenue components in fiscal 2014 

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers’ assets grow and due to maintenance fees associated with new software implemented 

electronic payment services continue to experience the largest dollar growth the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card transaction processing services online bill payment services and ach processing 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our credit union core products 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased slightly although there will be continuing quarterly fluctuations we expect there to be an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the general deflationary trend of computer prices 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs were recognized as they were incurred cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consists of the direct costs of third party software sales of third party software products decreased slightly compared to last year causing a slight increase in gross profit margins 

gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year margins are slightly lower due to decreased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for the year increased mainly due to higher commission expenses and a general increase in sales headcount and related salaries this is in line with increased sales volume of long term service contracts on which commissions are paid as a percentage of total revenue 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased headcount and related salaries 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs 

general and administrative expenses in the current year includes 2900 of insurance recoveries of costs related to the impact of hurricane sandy flooding on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center whereas the prior year includes 12436  of expenses related to the same event general and administrative expenses excluding the lyndhurst expenses and subsequent insurance recoveries increased slightly yearoveryear due to additional headcount and related salaries 



interest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances interest expense decreased due to full repayment of our term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 110135  or 354  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2014  compared with 83205  or 320  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2013  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the prior year quarter following the close of an internal revenue service audit of fiscal years 2010 and 2011 as well as the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation credit during the prior year quarter 

net income 

net income increased from 176645  or 204  per diluted share in fiscal 2013  to 201136  or 236  per diluted share in fiscal 2014  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 revenues increased 10 or 102277 compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which resulted in a 13 increase in gross profit 

operating expenses increased 13 for the year mainly due to expenses related to the impact of widespread flooding caused by hurricane sandy on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center expenses related to this event totaled 12475 for fiscal 2013 net of 2390 insurance recoveries received in the year 

increased revenue and gross margins partially offset by increased operating expenses resulted in a combined 14 increase in net income for fiscal 2013 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

license revenue remained consistent with the prior year due to strong results from our core and complementary credit union products being offset by reduced revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions which reduced from a particularly strong prior year 

while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital investment in license fees we expect this trend to continue in the long term 





support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services and implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training there was growth in all components of support and service revenue in fiscal 2013 

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance fee increases as our customers’ assets grew revenue from our complementary products also grew as the total number of supported inhouse products grew 

electronic payment services continued to experience the largest growth the revenue increases were attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card processing services online bill payment services and ach processing 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continued to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our core banking and credit union platform products and related complementary products coupled with higher merger conversion revenues from our core banking platform and outsourcing products 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in the number of third party hardware systems and components delivered 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs were recognized as they were incurred cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred 



cost of license consisted of the direct costs of third party software sales of third party software products decreased compared to the prior year leading to lower related costs and slightly increased gross profit margins 

gross profit margins in support and service increased due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues particularly in electronic payment services 

in general changes in cost of hardware trended consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year margins decreased slightly impacted by reduced sales of higher margin products related to hardware upgrades 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conducted our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and were overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives were responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurtured longterm relationships with our client base and cross sold our many complementary products and services

interest income was unusually high in the prior year mainly from contractual interest income on previously uncollected deconversion revenues interest expense increased from the prior year due to costs related to the early payment of the term loan during fiscal 2013 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 83205 or 320 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2013 compared with 76684 or 331 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2012 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the completion of the internal revenue service audit of the tax returns for the fiscal years june 30 2010 and 2011 which resulted in the recognition of previouslyunrecognized tax benefits and the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation tax credit through december 31 2013 

net income 

net income increased from 154984 or 178 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 to 176645 or 204 per diluted share in fiscal 2013 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a provider of integrated computer systems that perform data processing available for inhouse installations or outsourced services for banks and credit unions the company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments bank systems and services “bank” and credit union systems and services “credit union” the company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors including prospects for growth return on investment and return on revenue   



in fiscal 2014 revenue increased 8  overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to increased support and service revenue within support and service revenue the increase was driven by 12 yearoveryear growth in electronic payment services revenues from transaction processing and a 10 increase in outsourcing services revenue gross profit margins remain consistent yearoveryear 

in fiscal 2013 revenue increased 9 overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to 17 growth in electronic transaction processing services and an 11 

increase in outsourcing services the slight increase in margin was driven mainly by increased support and service margins due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues particularly in electronic payment services 



in fiscal 2014 revenue in the credit union segment increased 6  over the prior year driven by all components of support  service revenue in particular electronic payment services increased due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and inhouse maintenance revenues also increased gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due to economies of scale realized from growing transaction volume in our payment processing services 

in fiscal 2013 revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment increased in all three of our revenue areas license support  service and hardware support  service revenues grew 13 through increases in all components particularly electronic payment services due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and outsourcing services gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due to increased license revenue from licenses with no related costs and increased support and service margins due to economies of scale realized 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future 

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 70377  at june 30 2014  from 127905  at june 30 2013  the decrease from june 30 2013 is primarily due to the banno acquisition and ongoing purchases of treasury stock 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities increased 11  compared to last year cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends repurchase stock and other capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 totaled 131780  and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 33185  which mainly included the purchase of aircraft and computer equipment other uses of cash included 27894  of payments for the acquisition of banno 62194  for the development of software and 16288  for the purchase and development of internal use software these expenditures have been partially offset by 7781  proceeds received primarily from sale of aircraft cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 totaled 97244 and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment totaled 46256 which included spending on our online bill payment data center migration and an aircraft purchase other uses of cash included 51332 for the development of software and 186 for the acquisition of customer contracts these expenditures were partially offset by 530 proceeds from sale of assets 

financing activities used cash of 267407  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 cash used was mainly dividends paid to stockholders of 71251  175699  for the purchase of treasury shares and repayments of capital leases of 22158 cash used was partially offset by 1701  net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation during the fourth quarter the company also borrowed 25000  against its revolving line of credit 

and the full amount of the borrowing was repaid in the same period financing activities used cash of 241338 during fiscal 2013 there were cash outflows to repay long and short term borrowings on our credit facilities of 145180 dividends paid to stockholders of 48202 and repurchases of treasury shares of 58126 cash used was partially offset by 10170 net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation 

at june 30 2014 the company had negative working capital of 44435  however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 312002  which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we continue to have access to unused lines of credit in excess of 150000  and continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition 

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures in the fiscal year were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities these additions were funded from cash generated by operations at june 30 2014 the company had 24223  of purchase commitments related to property and equipment we anticipate that these commitments will be funded by cash generated by operations 

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facilities the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2014  there were 19795  shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 5196  additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2014  is 577781  during fiscal 2014  the company repurchased 3041  treasury shares for 175699  at june 30 2013  there were 16754  shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 8237  additional shares 

on august 22 2014  the companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of 022 per share on its common stock payable on september 26 2014 to shareholders of record on september 5 2014  current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the companys financial picture continues to be favorable 

capital leases 

the company has entered into various capital lease obligations for the use of certain computer equipment long term capital lease obligations were entered into of which 7757  remains outstanding at june 30 2014  of which 4028  will be maturing within the next twelve months the company also has short term capital lease obligations totaling 1379  at june 30 2014  

other lines of credit 

the long term revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to 150000  which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to 250000  the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to a a rate based on libor or b an alternate base rate the greater of a the federal funds rate plus 05  b the prime rate or c libor plus 10  plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the companys leverage ratio the credit facility is secured by pledges of capital stock of certain subsidiaries of the company and also guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement as of june 30 2014  the company was in compliance with all such covenants the revolving loan terminates june 4 2015  and at june 30 2014  there was no  outstanding revolving loan balance 

the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on march 3 2014  which provides for funding of up to 5000  and bears interest at the prime rate less 1 the credit line was renewed through april 30 2017  at june 30 2014  no  amount was outstanding 

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

at june 30 2014  the company’s total off balance sheet contractual obligations were 55370  this balance consists of 31147  of longterm operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2015  to 2021  and 24223  of purchase commitments related to property and equipment the contractual obligations table below excludes 8620  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 



recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014 the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements   

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license fee revenue   for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately when we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized following the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 

support and service fee revenue   implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations 

revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours 

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 

outsourced data processing services and electronic payment services revenues are recognized based on the fair value of individual elements in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2014  and are therefore not currently exposed to interest risk

 business strategy 

our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions we execute this strategy by 

 acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions including 27 material acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999 we continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to 

 we have not completed an acquisition since fiscal year 2010 after 37 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues in addition we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions 

we have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction complement and accelerate our organic growth and generate longterm profitable growth for our shareholders until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position to the benefit of our shareholders such as repurchases of jkhy stock and payment of dividends 

our three most recent material acquisitions were

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 symitar’s two functionally distinct core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally 

license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four  data centers located in three  physical locations we also provide image item processing services from two  hostarchive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country we print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from two  regional printing and rendering centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than   100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs

implementation and training 

the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their inhouse systems 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system being implemented our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

implementation and training services also are provided in connection with new customers outsourcing their information processing to jha

including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 percent of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2013  totaled 4988 million  consisting of 1058 million  for inhouse products and services and 3930 million  for outsourcing services approximately 3117 million  of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2013  is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2014  due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2012  totaled 4353 million  consisting of 927 million  for inhouse products and services and 3426 million  for outsourcing services 

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2014  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  were 632 million  609 million  and 634 million  respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  was 513 million  379 million  and 270 million  respectively

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and harland financial solutions – ultradata profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our company’s source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss  the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house  “ ach ”  payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services 

in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers expose us to damage claims and   cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and   lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in 2010 significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations many of which are still being written these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful 

we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers   our primary market consists of approximately 7000  commercial and savings banks and 7100  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the last decade and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory    and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following section provides managements view of the financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

overview 

jack henry  associates inc jha is headquartered in monett missouri employs approximately 5200  associates nationwide and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations its solutions serve more than 11300  customers and are marketed and supported through three primary brands jack henry banking® supports banks ranging from community to midtier multibillion dollar institutions with information and transaction processing solutions symitar® is a leading provider of information and transaction processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes profitstars® provides specialized products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry to mitigate and control risks optimize revenue and growth opportunities and contain costs jhas integrated solutions are available for inhouse installation and outsourced and hosted delivery 

each of our brands share the fundamental commitment to provide high quality business solutions service levels that consistently exceed customer expectations integration of solutions and practical new technologies the quality of our solutions our high service standards and the fundamental way we do business typically foster longterm customer relationships attract prospective customers and have enabled us to capture substantial market share 

through internal product development disciplined acquisitions and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new crosssales opportunities across our three business brands we provide compatible computer hardware for our inhouse installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced and hosted solutions we perform data conversions software implementations initial and ongoing customer training and ongoing customer support services 

our primary competitive advantage is customer service our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels we believe to be the highest in the markets we serve and generate high levels of customer satisfaction and retention we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and random surveys we receive in our everyday business dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience including product implementation education and consulting services 

the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring outsourcing fees and transaction processing fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater support and service fees also include inhouse maintenance fees on primarily annual contract terms less predictable software license fees and hardware sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

during the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 745593  in fiscal 2009  to 1129386  in fiscal 2013  income from continuing operations has grown from 103102  in fiscal 2009  to 176645  in fiscal 2013  this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions 

we have two reportable segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales 

we continue to focus on areas of our company to accomplish our ongoing objective of providing the best integrated solutions products and customer service available to our clients we are currently cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect our clients to continue investing in our products and services that are needed to improve their operating efficiencies and performance we anticipate consolidation within the financial services industry to continue including some reduced amount of bank failures and an increasing amount of merger and acquisition activity regulatory conditions and legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act will continue to impact the financial services industry and potentially motivate some financial institutions to postpone discretionary spending 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2012  and compare fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2011  

results of operations 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

in fiscal 2013  revenues increased 10  or 102277  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which has resulted in a 13  increase in gross profit 

operating expenses increased 13  for the year mainly due to expenses related to the impact of widespread flooding caused by hurricane sandy on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center expenses related to this event totaled 12475  for fiscal 2013 net of 2390  insurance recoveries received in the year insurance claims have been made by jha to recover the portions of the remaining expenses incurred related to hurricane sandy these open insurance recovery claims have not been finalized and no amounts have been recorded in the financial results for the year ended june 30 2013 the amount recovered will likely be less than the amount of the expense 

increased revenue and gross margins partially offset by increased operating expenses resulted in a combined 14  increase in net income for fiscal 2013 

we move into fiscal 2014 following record revenue achieved in fiscal 2013 significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

license revenue has remained consistent to last year due to strong results from our core and complementary credit union products being offset by reduced revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions which reduced from a particularly strong prior year 

while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital investment in license fees we expect this trend to continue in the long term 





support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services and implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training there was growth in all components of support and service revenue in fiscal 2013  

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance fee increases as our customers’ assets grow revenue from our complementary products has also grown as the total number of supported inhouse products has grown 

electronic payment services continue to experience the largest growth the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across debitcredit card processing services online bill payment services and ach processing 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our core banking and credit union platform products and related complementary products coupled with higher merger conversion revenues from our core banking platform and outsourcing products 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in the number of third party hardware systems and components delivered although there will be continuing fluctuations we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the deflationary trend of computer prices generally 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred 



cost of license consists of the direct costs of third party software sales of third party software products decreased compared to last year leading to lower related costs and slightly increased gross profit margins 

gross profit margins in support and service increased due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues particularly in electronic payment services 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year margins have decreased slightly being impacted by reduced sales of higher margin products related to hardware upgrades 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for the year have increased mainly due to higher commission expenses this is in line with increased sales volume of long term service contracts on which commissions are paid as a percentage of total revenue 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased salary costs 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expenses increased compared to last year due mainly to 12475  of expenses net of 2390  insurance recoveries received related to the impact of widespread flooding caused by hurricane sandy on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center 



interest income was unusually high in the prior year mainly from contractual interest income on previously uncollected deconversion revenues interest expense increased from the prior year due to costs related to the early payment of the term loan during fiscal 2013 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 83205  or 320  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2013  compared with 76684  or 331  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2012  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the completion of the internal revenue service audit of the tax returns for the fiscal years june 30 2010 and 2011 which resulted in the recognition of previouslyunrecognized tax benefits and the retroactive extension of the research and experimentation tax credit through december 31 2013 

net income 

net income increased from 154984  or 178  per diluted share in fiscal 2012  to 176645  or 204  per diluted share in fiscal 2013  

fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

in fiscal 2012 revenues increased 6 or 60212 compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services as well as continued revenue growth in all three of our components of revenue license support and service and hardware during fiscal 2012 the company continued to focus on cost management and also reduced interest cost through our sustained repayment of longterm debt these changes have resulted in a 13 increase in net income 

the current condition of the us financial markets continues to impact the overall demand and spending for new products and services by some of our customers the profitability of many financial institutions continues to improve but in many cases remains low and this appears to have resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services during the past four years a number of financial institutions have closed or merged due to regulatory action we believe that regulatory closings will continue to decline through fiscal 2013 absent a significant downturn in the economy furthermore the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations has been to some extent offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

the increase in license revenue is due to strong results from our silverlake® and episys® core systems and related complementary products including 4sight™ item imaging and our profitstar® financial management and budgeting solutions the increase was partially offset by reduced revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions and our argo products our suite of retail solutions including branch sales automation which have both reduced slightly from a particularly strong prior year 

while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital investment in license fees we expect this trend to continue in the long term 





support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services and implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training there was strong growth in support and service revenue in fiscal 2012 

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance fee increases as our customers’ assets have grown and increased revenues from our system conversion services revenue from our complementary products has also grown as the total number of supported inhouse products has grown 

electronic payment services continue to experience the largest growth the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across our electronic payment products particularly from debitcredit card processing services online bill payment services and ach processing 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased episys® credit union core product implementation revenues as well as higher online bill payment services implementation revenues 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue increased slightly due to an increase in the number of third party hardware systems and components delivered as existing customers upgraded their hardware systems although there will be continuing fluctuations we expect there to be an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the deflationary trend of computer prices generally 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred 



cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year sales of third party software products has increased slightly compared to last year but has decreased as a percentage of total license revenue leading to lower related costs and slightly increased gross profit margins 

cost of support and service increased commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue as evidenced by the consistent gross profit margins 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year increased sales of higher margin products related to hardware upgrades has driven higher hardware margins compared to last year 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for the year have increased mainly due to higher commission expenses this is in line with increased sales volume of long term service contracts on which commissions are paid as a percentage of total revenue 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once 

per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses decreased primarily due to increased capitalization of costs for ongoing software development projects which has also driven the decreases in the percentage of total revenue 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expenses decreased due mainly to decreased legal expenses compared to the same period last year 

interest income expense 



the significant increase in interest income in the current year relates mainly to contractual interest income on previously uncollected deconversion revenues of 782 following a favorable legal judgment the related deconversion revenue not previously recognized of 1593 is included in support and services revenue in the current fiscal year 

interest expense decreased due mainly to decreases in the outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and term loan through fiscal 2012 which have reduced interest costs this year compared to last year 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 76684 or 331 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2012 compared with 70041 or 338 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2011 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the completion of the internal revenue service audit of the tax returns for the fiscal years june 30 2008 and 2009 partially offset by the research and experimentation tax credit not being extended effective december 31 2011 

net income 

net income increased moving from 137471 or 159 per diluted share in fiscal 2011 to 154984 or 178 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a provider of integrated computer systems that perform data processing available for inhouse installations or outsourced services for banks and credit unions the company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments bank systems and services “bank” and credit union systems and services “credit union” the company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors including prospects for growth return on investment and return on revenue   



in fiscal 2013 revenue increased 9  overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to 17 growth in electronic transaction processing services and an 11 increase in outsourcing services the slight increase in margin is driven mainly by increased support and service margins due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues particularly in electronic payment services 

in fiscal 2012 revenue increased 4  overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to 12 growth in electronic transaction processing services and a 4 increase in outsourcing services the increasing proportion of support and service revenue at 40 gross margin has driven the small decrease in gross margin compared to last year 



in fiscal 2013 revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment has increased in all three of our revenue areas license support  service and hardware support  service revenues grew 13 through increases in all components particularly electronic payment services due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and outsourcing services gross profit margins for the credit union segment have increased mainly due to increased license revenue from licenses with no related costs and increased support and service margins due to economies of scale realized from increased revenues 

in fiscal 2012 revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment has increased in all three of our revenue areas license support  service and hardware support  service revenues grew 14 through increases in all components particularly electronic payment services due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and implementation services due to increased episys® installations gross profit margins for the credit union segment have increased mainly due to increased license revenue achieving 93 margin and increased electronic payment services margins from incremental transactionbased revenues 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future 

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 127905  at june 30 2013  from 157313  at june 30 2012  this is primarily due to repayment of the remaining 127500  on the term loan 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities increased 17  compared to last year cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends repurchase stock and fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures the increase compared to last year reflects increased earnings driven by continued strong revenue growth and ongoing cost control 

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  totaled 97244  and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment totaled 46256  which included spend on our online bill payment data center migration and an aircraft purchase other uses of cash included 51332  for the development of software and 186  for the acquisition of customer contracts these expenditures have been partially offset by 530  proceeds from sale of assets cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  totaled 76262  this included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 41441  37873  for the development of software and 2772  proceeds from sale of assets mainly from an aircraft sale 

financing activities used cash of 241338  during the current year there were cash outflows to repay long and short term borrowings on our credit facilities of 145180  dividends paid to stockholders of 48202  and repurchases of treasury shares of 58126  cash used was partially offset by 10170  net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation during fiscal 2012  net cash used by financing activities was 94100  and

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu no 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning july 1 2013 and we do not anticipate that this update will materially impact the financial statements   

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 income taxes the amendments update guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning january 1 2014 and we do not anticipate that this update will materially impact the financial statements   

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license fee revenue   for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately when we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized following the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 

support and service fee revenue   implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours 

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 

outsourced data processing services and electronic payment services revenues are recognized based on the fair value of individual elements in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these 

factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments  we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we d o not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2013  and are therefore not currently exposed to interest risk

 focused diversification acquisition strategy

historically our acquisition strategy focused on companies that 

 in 2004 we adopted our focused diversification acquisition strategy and began acquiring companies and highly specialized products that are

 these products and services enable us to expand our reach well beyond our traditional markets with solutions that are appropriate for virtually any financial services organization including thousands of institutions that we previously did not sell to 

following are the acquisitions that have been made in the last five fiscal years to support jha’s focused diversification 



solutions

 we will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels regularly enhanced using an interactive customer enhancement process compliant with relevant regulations updated with proven advances in technology and consistent with jha’s reputation as a premium product and service provider 

core software systems 

core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit loan and general ledger transactions and to maintain centralized customermember information 

jack henry banking markets three core software systems to banks and symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions these core systems are available for inhouse installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to jha based on the core processing solution most compatible with their specific operational requirements 

jack henry banking’s three core banking platforms are 

 7 

 symitar’s two functionally distinct core credit union platforms are 

 customers electing to install our solutions inhouse license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees the large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees we also remarket the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions and we contract to perform software implementation data conversion training ongoing support and other related services inhouse customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location 

customers can eliminate the significant upfront capital expenditures required by inhouse installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to jha our outsourcing services are provided through a national network of data centers in five  physical locations and four  imageenabled item processing centers customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five  or more years that include transactionbased processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period 

we support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products the ongoing integration of practical new technologies and regulatory compliance initiatives jha also serves each core customer as a single point of contact support and accountability 

complementary products and services 

we provide more than 100  complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers and selectively sold by our profitstars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems 

these complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customermember demands expedite speedtomarket with competitive offerings increase operating efficiency address specific operational issues and generate new revenue streams the highly specialized solutions sold by profitstars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities increase security and mitigate operational risks and control operating costs as part of profitstars ipay technologies our most recent acquisition provides a configurable electronic payments platform and turnkey online bill payment solutions that can integrate with any online banking platform

hardware systems 

hardware sales support our software systems and include nonjha products that we remarket 

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation avnet inc and other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware at a discount and resell it directly to our customers we currently sell the ibm power systems and system x servers lenovo workstations dell servers and workstations burroughs rdm panini digital check canon check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions 

implementation and training 

while it is not essential the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation 

and training services in connection with their inhouse systems 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system being implemented our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed 

implementation and training services also are provided in connection with new customers outsourcing their information processing to jha 

we also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers knowitall education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education the curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of jha’s core and complementary products to optimize ongoing system enhancements and to fully understand dynamic yearend legislative and regulatory requirements each basic intermediate and advanced course is delivered by system experts supported by professional materials and training tools and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach knowitall education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels including classroombased courses offered in jha’s regional training centers internetbased live instruction elearning courses onsite training and trainthetrainer programs 

support and services 

we serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide the company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates 

 jha’s experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform also provides highly effective change management and control processes 

most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 percent of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 60 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees 

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each year by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period 

backlog as of june 30 2012  totaled 4353 million  consisting of 927 million  for inhouse products and services and 3426 million  for outsourcing services approximately 2683 million  of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2012  is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2013  due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2011  totaled 3588 million  consisting of 791 million  for inhouse products and services and 2797 million  for outsourcing services 

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2013  the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities 

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  were 609 million  634 million  and 508 million  respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  was 379 million  270 million  and 256 million  respectively

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future 

jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc open solutions inc and harland financial solutions – ultradata profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the company’s operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired 

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions  we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we may be particularly exposed to the current difficult and unsettled economic climate if the economic environment remains poor it may result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their financial failure 

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income  we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete 

security problems could damage our reputation and business  we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in a financial loss  the volume and dollar amount 

of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in a financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business  the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues 

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers  our primary market consists of approximately 7300  commercial and savings banks and 7300  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations  the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability 

an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to lose customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could damage our relationship with customers and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers 

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such 

acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  we have acquired a number of businesses in the last several years and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets 

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages  we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 

we may not be able to manage growth  we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks  some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business  our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five  or more years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following section provides managements view of the financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

overview 

jack henry  associates inc jha is headquartered in monett missouri employs approximately 4900  associates nationwide and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations its solutions serve more than 11900  customers and are marketed and supported through three primary brands jack henry banking® supports banks ranging from community to midtier multibillion dollar institutions with information and transaction processing solutions symitar® is a leading provider of information and transaction processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes profitstars® provides specialized products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry to mitigate and control risks optimize revenue and growth opportunities and contain costs jhas integrated solutions are available for inhouse installation and outsourced and hosted delivery 

each of our brands share the fundamental commitment to provide high quality business solutions service levels that consistently exceed customer expectations integration of solutions and practical new technologies the quality of our solutions our high service standards and the fundamental way we do business typically foster longterm customer relationships attract prospective customers and have enabled us to capture substantial market share 

through internal product development disciplined acquisitions and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new crosssales opportunities across our three marketed brands we provide compatible computer hardware for our inhouse installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced and hosted solutions we perform data conversions software implementations initial and ongoing customer training and ongoing customer support services 

our primary competitive advantage is customer service our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels we believe to be the highest in the markets we serve and generate high levels of customer satisfaction and 

retention we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and random surveys we receive in our everyday business dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience including product implementation education and consulting services 

the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring outsourcing fees transaction processing fees and support and service fees that generally have contract terms of five years or greater less predictable software license fees and hardware sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins 

during the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 742926  in fiscal 2008  to 1027109  in fiscal 2012  income from continuing operations has grown from 105287  in fiscal 2008  to 154984  in fiscal 2012  this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions 

our three most recent acquisitions were completed in fiscal 2010 all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 

we have two reportable segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales 

we are cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect to continue investing in the products and services our clients need to improve their operating efficiencies and performance we anticipate consolidation within the financial services industry to continue including bank failures and increased merger and acquisition activity regulatory conditions and legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform act and consumer protection act will continue to impact the financial services industry and potentially motivate some financial institutions to postpone discretionary spending 

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2011  and compare fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2010  

results of operations 

fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

in fiscal 2012  revenues increased 6  or 60212  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services as well as continued revenue growth in all three of our components of revenue license support and service and hardware during fiscal 2012  the company continued to focus on cost management and also reduced interest cost through our sustained repayment of longterm debt these changes have resulted in a 13  increase in net income 

the current condition of the us financial markets continues to impact the overall demand and spending for new products and services by some of our customers the profitability of many financial institutions continues to improve but in many cases remains low and this appears to have resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services during the past four years a number of financial institutions have closed or merged due to regulatory action we believe that regulatory closings will continue to decline through fiscal 2013 absent a significant downturn in the economy furthermore the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations has been to some extent offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions 

we move into fiscal 2013 with cautious optimism following strong fourth  quarter fiscal 2012  results significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and increases in backlog coupled with a healthy sales pipeline are also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution 

the increase in license revenue is due to strong results from our silverlake® and episys® core systems and related complementary products including 4sight™ item imaging and our profitstar® financial management and budgeting solutions the increase was partially offset by reduced revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions and our argo products our suite of retail solutions including branch sales automation which have both reduced slightly from a particularly strong prior year 

while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital investment in license fees we expect this trend to continue in the long term 





support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software electronic payment services outsourced data processing services and implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training there was strong growth in support and service revenue in fiscal 2012  

inhouse support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance fee increases as our customers’ assets have grown and increased revenues from our system conversion services revenue from our complementary products has also grown as the total number of supported inhouse products has grown 

electronic payment services continue to experience the largest growth the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across our electronic payment products particularly from debitcredit card processing services online bill payment services and ach processing 

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues 

implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased episys® credit union core product implementation revenues as well as higher online bill payment services implementation revenues 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue increased slightly due to an increase in the number of third party hardware systems and components delivered as existing customers upgraded their hardware systems although there will be continuing fluctuations we expect there to be an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the deflationary trend of computer prices generally 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred 



cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year sales of third party software products has increased slightly compared to last year but has decreased as a percentage of total license revenue leading to lower related costs and slightly increased gross profit margins 

cost of support and service increased commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue as evidenced by the consistent gross profit margins 

in general changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue for the fiscal year increased sales of higher margin products related to hardware upgrades has driven higher hardware margins compared to last year 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

selling and marketing expenses for the year have increased mainly due to higher commission expenses this is in line with increased sales volume of long term service contracts on which commissions are paid as a percentage of total revenue 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses decreased primarily due to increased capitalization of costs for ongoing software development projects which has also driven the decreases in the percentage of total revenue 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expenses decreased due mainly to decreased legal expenses compared to the same period last year 



the significant increase in interest income in the current year relates mainly to contractual interest income on previously uncollected deconversion revenues of 782 following a favorable legal judgment the related deconversion revenue not previously recognized of 1593 is included in support and services revenue in the current fiscal year 

interest expense decreased due mainly to decreases in the outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and term loan through fiscal 2012 which have reduced interest costs this year compared to last year 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 76684  or 331  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2012  compared with 70041  or 338  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2011  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the completion of the internal revenue service audit of the tax returns for the fiscal years june 30 2008 and 2009 partially offset by the research and experimentation tax credit not being extended effective december 31 

2011 

net income 

net income increased moving from 137471  or 159  per diluted share in fiscal 2011  to 154984  or 178  per diluted share in fiscal 2012  

fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010   

in fiscal 2011  revenues increased 16  or 130311  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong organic growth and the prior year acquisitions of goldleaf financial solutions inc “gfsi” pemco technology services inc “ptsi” and ipay technologies holding company llc “ipay” during fiscal 2011  the company’s management continued to focus on cost management that when combined with the growth in revenue resulted in a 17  increase in net income 

slow recovery from the us financial crisis remains a primary concern as it continues to threaten our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions remain low and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services during the past two years a number of financial institutions have failed or been subject to government intervention to date such actions have not materially impacted our revenue or results of operations 

in each of the past two years approximately 1 of all financial institutions in the united states have closed or merged due to regulatory action we believe that the number of regulatory actions will continue to decline through fiscal 2012 absent a significant downturn in the economy the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations has been offset to some extent by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions a consolidation can benefit us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform or elects to move to one of our platforms and can negatively impact us when a competing platform is elected consolidations and acquisitions also positively impact our financial results in the shortterm due to early termination fees which are generally provided for in multiyear outsourced contracts these fees are primarily generated when an existing outsourced client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action or from a customer that has selected inhouse processing 

despite the difficult economic climate we remain cautiously optimistic with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and an encouraging sales pipeline our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we continue to have a strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise as the economic recovery strengthens our cautious optimism was expressed through our acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay during fiscal 2010 and these acquisitions the three largest in our company’s history combined with our existing solutions present us with opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders 

revenue 



license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 

the increase in license revenue for the current year is primarily due to increased organic revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions and an additional quarter of revenues from gfsi acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

this increase has been partially offset by decreases in our core software and imaging software license revenues for which the average deal size was smaller compared to a year ago we believe our customers are continuing to postpone major capital investments in technology including software due to the slowly recovering economy in addition our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license 

agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees 





support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and electronic payment services there was strong growth in all support and service revenue components in fiscal 2011 

inhouse support and other services revenue increased as the acquisition of gfsi contributed additional revenue of 5648 compared to a year ago additionally annual maintenance fees have increased as our customers’ assets have grown and revenue from our complementary products has grown as the total number of supported inhouse customers has grown 

electronic payment services includes atm debit and credit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and transaction processing services with revenues being primarily derived from transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers electronic payment services continued to experience the largest percentage revenue growth the revenue growth is attributable to the acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay which combined to add 68663 during the current year and organic revenue growth within electronic payment services excluding the effects of the acquisitions continues to be strong with an increase of 12 over the prior fiscal year 

outsourcing services are performed through our data and item processing centers with revenues primarily derived from monthly usage or transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future 

the increase in implementation services revenue is primarily related to acquisition related revenues of 2683 for gfsi acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and increased revenue from merger conversions of 3754 for existing customers that acquired other financial institutions 



the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers 

hardware revenue decreased slightly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered compared to last year hardware revenue has been generally commensurate with the trends in license revenue however we expect the overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the trend towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware 

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated 

with license fee revenue these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred 



cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year these costs have increased as a percentage of license revenue as complementary software sales that have associated third party vendor costs have increased 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue support and service gross profit has increased over the prior year as a result of the acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay which combined to contribute additional support and service gross profit of 38177 over last year support and service gross profit margin remained consistent year over year with the additional combined margins for gfsi and ipay of 45 being offset by lower margins achieved for ptsi of 30 

cost of hardware has fluctuated in line with hardware revenue for the current year 

operating expenses 



dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two reportable segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2011 fiscal year selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increasing personnel costs including commission expenses for the additional employees acquired in the fiscal 2010 acquisitions which added 6001 to this line during the current year selling and marketing expenses have remained consistent as a percentage of total 

revenue due to the continued focus on cost management throughout the company 



we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased due to the acquisitions in fiscal 2010 and increased personnel consultant and independent contractor costs compared to the same period a year ago this also caused the increase from 6 of total revenue in fiscal 2010 to 7 in fiscal 2011 



general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs 

general and administrative expenses increased slightly for the year due to additional personnel and other costs from the prior year acquisitions this increase was partially offset by onetime acquisition transaction costs incurred in fiscal 2010 of 4237 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2011 

interest income expense 

interest income decreased 22  from 161  to 125  due primarily to lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased from 1618  to 8930  due to increased borrowings made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to consummate the acquisition of ipay 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 70041  or 338  of income before income taxes in fiscal 2011  compared with 62926  or 348  of income before income taxes fiscal 2010  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the extension of the research and experimentation credit “re credit” effective january 1 2010 as well as the increase in the applicable deduction percentage for domestic production activities irc section 199 effective for fiscal 2011 

net income 

net income increased moving from 117870  or 138  per diluted share in fiscal 2010  to 137471  or 159  per diluted share in fiscal 2011  

reportable segment discussion 

the company is a provider of integrated computer systems that perform data processing available for inhouse installations or outsourced services for banks and credit unions the company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments bank systems and services “bank” and credit union systems and services “credit union” the company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors including prospects for growth return on investment and return on revenue   



in fiscal 2012 revenue increased 4  overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due mainly to 12 growth in electronic transaction processing services and a 4 increase in outsourcing services the increasing proportion of support and service revenue at 40 gross margin has driven the small decrease in gross margin compared to last year 

in fiscal 2011 revenue increased 11 overall in the bank systems and services reportable segment compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the acquisitions of gfsi and ipay which added 40150 of additional revenue in fiscal 2011 mainly in support and services in the bank systems and services reportable segment which increased 14 over the prior year coupled with electronic payment services organic revenue growth of nearly 12 over the prior year gross profit margin remained consistent year over year with gfsi and ipay margins performing within expectations 



in fiscal 2012 revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment has increased in all three of our revenue areas license support  service and hardware support  service revenues grew 14 through increases in all components particularly electronic payment services due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debitcredit card processing services and implementation services due to increased episys® installations gross profit margins for the credit union segment have increased mainly due to increased license revenue achieving 93 margin and increased electronic payment services margins from incremental transactionbased revenues 

in fiscal 2011 revenues in the credit union systems and services reportable segment increased 34 from fiscal 2010 all components of revenue increased particularly support and service revenue which increased by 38 over the prior year this was due primarily to the acquisitions of ptsi and ipay which added revenue of 38482 to current year revenue and electronic payment services which experienced 11 organic revenue growth gross profit margins have remained constant as a result of strong ipay margins being offset by slightly lower margins from the ptsi products 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future 

the companys cash and cash equivalents increased to 157313  at june 30 2012  from 63125  at june 30 2011  the cash balance at june 30 2011  was lower than the balance at june 30 2012  primarily due to repayments of the 100000 bullet loan and the 120000 revolving credit facility during last fiscal year 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 



cash provided by operating activities increased 10  compared to last year cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt pay dividends and fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures the increase compared to last year reflects increased earnings driven by continued strong revenue growth ongoing cost control and decreased interest costs 

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  totaled 76262  the largest use of of cash included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 41441  including buildout of our allen tx facility computer equipment purchases and related purchased software other major uses of cash included 37873  for the development of software and 720  for the acquisition of customer contracts this expenditure has been partially offset 

by 2772  proceeds from sale of assets mainly from an aircraft sale cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  was 59038  and included capital expenditures for facilities and equipment of 32085  and 26954  for the development of software 

financing activities used cash of 94100  during the current year there were cash outflows to repay long and short term borrowings on our credit facilities of 35280  dividends paid to stockholders of 38128  and repurchases of treasury shares of 34371  cash used was partially offset by 13679  net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation during fiscal 2011  net cash used by financing activities was 243487  and included 229854  repayments on our lines of credit and 34391  in dividend payments to shareholders partially offset by 20359  of net proceeds from the issuance of stock and tax related to stockbased compensation 

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures in the fiscal year were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities these additions were funded from cash generated by operations 

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facilities the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2012  there were 15452  shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 4539  additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2012  is 343956  during fiscal 2012  the company repurchased 1045  treasury shares for 34371  there were no repurchases of treasury stock in fiscal 2011  

on august 24 2012  the companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0115  per share on its common stock payable on september 28 2012  to shareholders of record on september 7 2012  current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the companys financial picture continues to be favorable

recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201104 fair value measurement in may 31 2011 which became effective for the company on january 1 2012 the updated explanatory guidance on measuring fair value did not have a significant impact on our fair value calculations and no additional fair value measurements were required as a result of the update   

the fasb also issued asu no 201105 comprehensive income in june 2011 which is effective for the company beginning july 1 2012 and will be applied retrospectively the updated guidance requires nonowner changes in stockholders equity to be reported either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements rather than as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity no changes in disclosure are anticipated as a result of the update   

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 testing goodwill for impairment which is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 although early adoption is permitted the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning july 1 2012   

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu no 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning july 1 2013   

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact 

the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 

license fee revenue   for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately when we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized following the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 

support and service fee revenue   implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours 

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 

outsourced data processing services and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered 

hardware revenue   hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis 

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment for commercial software products determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable 

income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2012  a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in fiscal 2013  by less than 1300

our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms we have established remarketing agreements with ibm corporation avnet inc and other hardware providers that allow jha to purchase hardware at a discount and resell it directly to our customers we currently sell the ibm power systems and system x servers lenovo workstations dell servers and workstations burroughs rdm panini digital check canon check scanners and other devices that complement our software solutions

jha has maintained a longterm strategic relationship with ibm dating back to the development of our first core software applications over 30 years ago this relationship has resulted in ibm naming jha as a “premier business partner every year since 1993 

implementation and training 

while it is not essential the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their inhouse systems 

a complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning project management data conversion and testing our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the jha system being implemented our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed

jha’s experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform also provides highly effective change management and control processes 

most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 percent of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 60 days prior to contract expiration 

high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees

jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each year by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations 

backlog 

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period

backlog as of june 30 2011 totaled 3588 million consisting of 791 million for inhouse products and services and 2797 million for outsourcing services approximately 2172 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2011 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2012 due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2010 totaled 3288 million consisting of 782 million for inhouse products and services and 2506 million for outsourcing services 

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2012 the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities

research and development 

we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 were 634 million 508 million and 429 million respectively capitalized software for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was 270 million 256 million and 247 million respectively

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future

jack henry banking symitar and ipay technologies compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc open solutions inc and harland financial solutions – ultradata profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the company’s operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we may be particularly exposed to the current difficult and unsettled economic climate if the economic environment remains poor it may result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their financial failure

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete

security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 7600 commercial and savings banks and 7600 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability

the doddfrank act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business t he doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” and requires the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations at this time it is difficult to predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients to the extent the regulations negatively impact the business operations or financial condition of our customers our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because among other matters our customers could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our customers we may not be able to update our existing products and services or develop new ones to satisfy our customers’ needs any of these events if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

failures associated with payment transactions could result in a financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in a financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us

an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could damage our relationship with customers and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers

we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the last several years and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

if our strategic relationship with ibm were terminated it could have a negative impact on the continuing success of our business we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers under an ibm business partner agreement and resell maintenance on ibm hardware products to our customers much of our software is designed to be compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally modify our strategic relationship our relationship with our customers and our revenues and earnings could suffer we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign existing products or develop new products for new hardware platforms 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the “selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

overview 

jha provides integrated computer systems for inhouse and outsourced data processing to commercial banks credit unions and other financial institutions we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market together with compatible computer hardware to these financial institutions we also perform data conversion and software implementation services for our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented for our customers who prefer not to make an upfront capital investment in software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our six data centers in five physical locations and six itemprocessing centers located throughout the united states

we derive revenues from three primary sources 

§

software license fees 

§

ongoing outsourcing fees transaction processing fees and support and service fees which include implementation services and

§

hardware sales which include all nonsoftware remarketed products

over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 666467 in fiscal 2007 to 966897 in fiscal 2011 income from continuing operations has grown from 105644 in fiscal 2007 to 137471 in fiscal 2011 this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services for approximately 11300 customers who utilize our software systems or services as of june 30 2011

our three most recent acquisitions were completed in fiscal 2010 all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 

we have two business segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 and compare fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009

results of operations 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2011 revenues increased 16 or 130311 compared to the prior year due primarily to strong organic growth and the prior year acquisitions of goldleaf financial solutions inc “gfsi” pemco technology services inc “ptsi” and ipay technologies holding company llc “ipay” during fiscal 2011 the company’s management continued to focus on cost management that when combined with the growth in revenue resulted in a 17 increase in net income 

slow recovery from the us financial crisis remains a primary concern as it continues to threaten our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions remain low and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services during the past two years a number of financial institutions have failed or been subject to government intervention to date such actions have not materially impacted our revenue or results of operations

in each of the past two years approximately 1 of all financial institutions in the united states have closed or merged due to regulatory action we believe that the number of regulatory actions will continue to decline through fiscal 2012 absent a significant downturn in the economy the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations has been offset to some extent by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions a consolidation can benefit us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform or elects to move to one of our platforms and can negatively impact us when a competing platform is elected consolidations and acquisitions also positively impact our financial results in the shortterm due to early termination fees which are generally provided for in multiyear outsourced contracts these fees are primarily generated when an existing outsourced client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action or from a customer that has selected inhouse processing

despite the difficult economic climate we remain cautiously optimistic with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and an encouraging sales pipeline our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we continue to have a strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise as the economic recovery strengthens our cautious optimism was expressed through our acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay during fiscal 2010 and these acquisitions the three largest in our company’s history combined with our existing solutions present us with opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders

revenue 

 

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

the increase in license revenue for the current year is primarily due to increased organic revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions and an additional quarter of revenues from gfsi acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010

this increase has been partially offset by decreases in our core software and imaging software license revenues for which the average deal size was smaller compared to a year ago we believe our customers are continuing to postpone major capital investments in technology including software due to the slowly recovering economy in addition our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees

 

support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and electronic payment services there was strong growth in all support and service revenue components in fiscal 2011

inhouse support and other services revenue increased as the acquisition of gfsi contributed additional revenue of 5648 compared to a year ago additionally annual maintenance fees have increased as our customers’ assets have grown and revenue from our complementary products has grown as the total number of supported inhouse customers has grown

electronic payment services includes atm debit and credit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and transaction processing services with revenues being primarily derived from transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers electronic payment services continued to experience the largest percentage revenue growth the revenue growth is attributable to the acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay which combined to add 68663 during the current year and organic revenue growth within electronic payment services excluding the effects of the acquisitions continues to be strong with an increase of 12 over the prior fiscal year

outsourcing services are performed through our data and item processing centers with revenues primarily derived from monthly usage or transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future

the increase in implementation services revenue is primarily related to acquisition related revenues of 2683 for gfsi acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and increased revenue from merger conversions of 3754 for existing customers that acquired other financial institutions

 

the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue decreased slightly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered compared to last year hardware revenue has been generally commensurate with the trends in license revenue however we expect the overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the trend towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with license fee revenue these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers electronic payment services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 

cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year these costs have increased as a percentage of license revenue as complementary software sales that have associated third party vendor costs have increased 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue support and service gross profit has increased over the prior year as a result of the acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay which combined to contribute additional support and service gross profit of 38177 over last year support and service gross profit margin remained consistent year over year with the additional combined margins for gfsi and ipay of 45 being offset by lower margins achieved for ptsi of 30

cost of hardware has fluctuated in line with hardware revenue for the current year

operating expenses 

 

dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2011 fiscal year selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increasing personnel costs including commission expenses for the additional employees acquired in the fiscal 2010 acquisitions which added 6001 to this line during the current year selling and marketing expenses have remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue due to the continued focus on cost management throughout the company

 

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased due to the acquisitions in fiscal 2010 and increased personnel consultant and independent contractor costs compared to the same period a year ago this also caused the increase from 6 of total revenue in fiscal 2010 to 7 in fiscal 2011

 

general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs 

general and administrative expenses increased slightly for the year due to additional personnel and other costs from the prior year acquisitions this increase was partially offset by onetime acquisition transaction costs incurred in fiscal 2010 of 4237 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2011

interest income expense 

interest income decreased 22 from 161 to 125 due primarily to lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased from 1618 to 8930 due to increased borrowings made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to consummate the acquisition of ipay

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 70041 or 338 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2011 compared with 62926 or 348 of income before income taxes fiscal 2010 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the extension of the research and experimentation credit “re credit” effective january 1 2010 as well as the increase in the applicable deduction percentage for domestic production activities irc section 199 effective for fiscal 2011

net income 

net income increased moving from 117870 or 138 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 to 137471 or 159 per diluted share in fiscal 2011

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 revenues increased 12 or 90993 compared to the prior year due primarily to the current year acquisition of gfsi ptsi and ipay during fiscal 2010 the company’s management engaged in various costcutting efforts that when combined with the growth in revenue resulted in a 14 increase in net income 

the us financial crisis is a primary concern at this time as it affects our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions have decreased and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services we remain cautiously optimistic however with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and an encouraging sales pipeline in specific areas our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we face these times with a strong balance sheet and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise when the economic rebound strengthens our cautious optimism has been expressed through our acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay during the year ended june 30 2010 these are the three largest acquisitions in our company’s history and present us with opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders

revenue 

 

license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

the decrease in license revenue for the current year is due mostly to decreases in complementary product license revenue compared to the prior year overall license revenue from our core software products were up 16 from the prior year in addition our acquisition of gfsi in october added 5638 in license revenue during fiscal 2010 these gains were more than offset by decreases in license revenue for most of our complementary software products these decreases in complementary software product license revenue result from the recent economic downturn as we have seen some of our customers postpone making nonessential capital investments in technology including software in addition our customers are often electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees or hardware

 

 

support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services

there was strong growth in all support and service revenue components in fiscal 2010 inhouse support and other services increased mostly as a result of the acquisition of gfsi which added revenue of 15527 since acquisition

eft support experienced the largest percentage growth most of the revenue growth in eft is attributable to the acquisition of gfsi ptsi and ipay combined the acquisitions added 55020 to this line during the current year however organic revenue growth within eft support continues to be strong with an increase of 8 over the prior fiscal year

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future

the increase in implementation services revenue is primarily related to the acquisition of gfsi which added 4452 in implementation revenue for the current year

 

the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered in the current year compared to a year ago hardware revenue has been generally commensurate with the trends in license revenue however while hardware revenue has benefitted from the acquisition of gfsi it has not benefitted to the same degree as license revenue gfsi added hardware revenue of 1301 since its acquisition

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 

the current year decrease in cost of license is generally commensurate with the related trends in license revenue cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year these costs have decreased as a percentage of license revenue as complementary software sales that have associated third party vendor costs have decreased 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue combined the companies acquired during fiscal 2010 added 50480 to this line support and services gross profit margin has increased for the year due to cost control measures undertaken by the company and as eft support services with higher margins than other components of support and services revenue have become a larger percentage of that revenue line

cost of hardware has fluctuated in line with hardware revenue for the current year with slightly leaner margins resulting from a shift in sales mix

operating expenses 

 

dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2010 fiscal year selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to current year acquisitions which added 10272 to this line during the current year the acquisitionrelated increases were partially offset by decreases in selling and marketing personnel costs throughout the rest of the company which were the result of costcutting measures undertaken by management

 

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased for the current year due primarily to current year acquisitions which added 8126 in expense during fiscal 2010 

 

general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expenses increased for the year due to current year acquisitions including costs directly related to the acquisition transactions combined the acquired companies added 7700 of general and administrative costs during fiscal 2010 including 4237 of onetime acquisition transaction costs

interest income expense 

interest income decreased 79 from 781 to 161 due primarily to lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased 19 from 1357 to 1618 due to primarily to borrowings made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to consummate the acquisition of ipay

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 62926 or 348 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2010 compared with 54208 or 345 of income before income taxes fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to the expiration of the research and experimentation credit “re credit” effective january 1 2010 as well as increases in the rate at which deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in future years these increases were mostly offset by additional benefits received through an extensive analysis of the domestic production activities deduction irc section 199

net income 

net income increased moving from 103102 or 122 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 to 117870 or 138 per diluted share in fiscal 2010

 

business segment discussion 

 

in fiscal 2011 revenue increased 11 overall in the bank systems and services business segment compared to the prior year the increase is due primarily to the acquisitions of gfsi and ipay which added 40150 of additional revenue in fiscal 2011 mainly in support and services in the bank systems and services business segment which increased 14 over the prior year coupled with electronic payment services organic revenue growth of nearly 12 over the prior year gross profit margin remained consistent year over year with gfsi and ipay margins performing within expectations

in fiscal 2010 revenue increased 9 overall in the bank systems and services business segment compared to the prior year most of the increase is due to the acquisition of gfsi which added 44794 of revenue in fiscal 2010 in addition eft support experienced organic revenue growth of nearly 10 over the prior year and data center maintenance had organic growth of 12 within the bank systems and services business segment gross profit margin increased from the prior year primarily due to cost control measures particularly related to personnel costs undertaken by management during fiscal 2010

 

in fiscal 2011 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 34 from fiscal 2010 all components of revenue increased particularly support and service revenue which increased by 38 over the prior year this was due primarily to the acquisitions of ptsi and ipay which added revenue of 38482 to current year revenue and electronic payment services which experienced 11 organic revenue growth gross profit margins have remained constant as a result of strong ipay margins being offset by slightly lower margins from the ptsi products 

in fiscal 2010 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 28 from fiscal 2009 support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced strong growth in most revenue components in particular eft support experienced 163 revenue growth over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of ptsi which added revenue of 33839 to fiscal 2011 revenue gross profit margins decreased from the prior year as license revenue which carries the largest margins decreased as a percentage of total revenue 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 63125 at june 30 2011 from 125518 at june 30 2010 the decrease is primarily due to the repayment of long and short term debt in the year

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

 

cash provided by operations increased 10 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in net income which grew through continued strong organic growth and the incremental earnings provided by the fiscal 2010 acquisitions

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2011 included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of 32085 including computer equipment purchases and the final costs relating to the construction of our new branson missouri and springfield missouri facilities other major uses of cash included 26954 for the development of software cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2010 was 505715 and includes a net cash outlay for acquisitions of 426652 capital expenditures of 54509 and capitalized software development of 25586 

net cash from financing activities for the current fiscal year includes 229455 net repayment on our credit facilities and the payment of dividends of 34391 cash used was partially offset by net proceeds of 20359 from the exercise of stock options the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises during fiscal 2010 net cash from financing activities for the current fiscal year was 294284 and includes 303160 net borrowing on our credit facilities proceeds of 28522 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and 661 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises cash from financing activities was partially offset by the payment of dividends of 30461 and debt acquisition costs of 7598

at june 30 2011 the company had negative working capital of 26561 however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 276837 which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we continue to have access to unused lines of credit in excess of 160000 and continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition

us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments over the last three years in the mortgage markets and the general economy while the effects of these events continue to impact our customers we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit

the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements capital expenditures in the fiscal year were made primarily for additional equipment new facilities and the improvement of existing facilities these additions were funded from cash generated by operations

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves of shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facility the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2011 there were 14407 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 5584 additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2011 is 309585 there were no repurchases of treasury stock in fiscal 2011 or 2010 

on august 19 2011 the company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0105 per share on its common stock payable on september 28 2011 to stockholders of record on september 8 2011 current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the company’s financial picture continues to be favorable

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements which is effective for arrangements beginning or changed during fiscal years starting after june 15 2010 this new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of revenue recognition and requires the allocation of consideration to each deliverable using the relative selling price method this new guidance did not have a material impact on revenue recognition because nearly all of the company’s revenue arrangements are subject to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 985 such arrangements are considered out of scope for this asu

in october 2009 the fasb also issued asu no 200914 software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements which is also effective for arrangements beginning or changed during fiscal years starting after june 15 2010 this revision to software topic 985 drops from its scope all tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that operate together to deliver the products functions the majority of the company’s software arrangements are not tangible products with software components therefore this update did not materially impact the company

the fasb issued asu no 201104 fair value measurement in may 2011 which is effective for the company beginning july 1 2012 and is to be applied prospectively the updated explanatory guidance on measuring fair value will be adopted by the company at that time and is not expected to have a significant impact on our fair value calculations no additional fair value measurements are required as a result of the update

the fasb also issued asu no 201105 comprehensive income in june 2011 which is effective for the company beginning january 1 2012 and will be applied retrospectively the updated guidance requires nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity to be reported either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements rather than as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity no changes in disclosure will be required as a result of the update

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements

license fee revenue for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately when we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized following the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted

support and service fee revenue implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates

outsourced data processing services and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered

hardware revenue hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment for commercial software products determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2011 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in fiscal 2012 by approximately 1500

backlog as of june 30 2010 totaled 3288 million consisting of 782 million for inhouse products and services and 2506 million for outsourcing services approximately 1892 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2010 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2011 due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2009 totaled 2894 million and consisted of 668 million for inhouse products and services and 2225 million for outsourcing services

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2011 the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities

competition 

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the company’s operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we may be particularly exposed to the current global economic recession if the economic environment remains poor it may result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their financial failure

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data tapes can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business

we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the last several years and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public without additional acquisitions we may not be able to grow and to develop new products and services as quickly as we have in the past to meet the competition if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

consolidation of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 7900 commercial and savings banks and 7800 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union association and the office of thrift supervision among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability

as technology becomes less expensive and more advanced purchase prices of hardware are declining and our revenues and profits from remarketing arrangements may decrease computer hardware technology is rapidly developing hardware manufacturers are producing less expensive and more powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into the future as computer hardware becomes less expensive revenues and profits derived from our hardware remarketing may decrease and become a smaller portion of our revenues and profits 

an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could damage our relationship with customers and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers

if our strategic relationship with ibm were terminated it could have a negative impact on the continuing success of our business we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers under an ibm business partner agreement and resell maintenance on ibm hardware products to our customers much of our software is designed to be compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally modify our strategic relationship our relationship with our customers and our revenues and earnings could suffer we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign existing products or develop new products for new hardware platforms 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the “selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

overview 

background and overview

we provide integrated computer systems for inhouse and outsourced data processing to commercial banks credit unions and other financial institutions we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market together with compatible computer hardware to these financial institutions we also perform data conversion and software implementation services for our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented for our customers who prefer not to make an upfront capital investment in software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our eight data centers in six physical locations and 10 itemprocessing centers located throughout the united states

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 and compare fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008

we derive revenues from three primary sources 



software licenses 



support and service fees which include implementation services and



hardware sales which includes all nonsoftware remarketed products

over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 590877 in fiscal 2006 to 836586 in fiscal 2010 income from continuing operations has grown from 90863 in fiscal 2006 to 117870 in fiscal 2010 this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services for approximately 11200 customers who utilize our software systems or services as of june 30 2010

since the start of fiscal 2008 we have completed 5 acquisitions all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 

support and services fees are generated from implementation services contracted with us by the customer ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software and from providing outsourced data processing services and electronic funds transfer “eft” support services which includes atm and debit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and transaction processing services outsourcing services are performed through our data and item processing centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and eft support services are primarily derived from monthly usage or transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers 

cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with license fee revenue 

cost of services represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item processing centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft services and direct operation costs 

we have entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services to our customers cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers 

we have two business segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales

results of operations 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 revenues increased 12 or 90993 compared to the prior year due primarily to the current year acquisition of goldleaf financial solutions inc “gfsi” pemco technology services inc “ptsi” and ipay technologies holding company llc “ipay” during fiscal 2010 the company’s management engaged in various costcutting efforts that when combined with the growth in revenue resulted in a 14 increase in net income 

the us financial crisis is a primary concern at this time as it affects our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions have decreased and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services we remain cautiously optimistic however with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and an encouraging sales pipeline in specific areas our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we face these times with a strong balance sheet and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise when the economic rebound strengthens our cautious optimism has been expressed through our acquisitions of gfsi ptsi and ipay during the year ended june 30 2010 these are the three largest acquisitions in our company’s history and present us with opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders

revenue 

 license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

the decrease in license revenue for the current year is due mostly to decreases in complementary product license revenue compared to the prior year overall license revenue from our core software products were up 16 from the prior year in addition our acquisition of gfsi in october added 5638 in license revenue during fiscal 2010 these gains were more than offset by decreases in license revenue for most of our complementary software products these decreases in complementary software product license revenue result from the recent economic downturn as we have seen some of our customers postpone making nonessential capital investments in technology including software in addition our customers are often electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees or hardware

 

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services

there was strong growth in all support and service revenue components in fiscal 2010 inhouse support and other services increased mostly as a result of the acquisition of gfsi which added revenue of 15527 since acquisition

eft support experienced the largest percentage growth most of the revenue growth in eft is attributable to the acquisition of gfsi ptsi and ipay combined the acquisitions added 55020 to this line during the current year however organic revenue growth within eft support continues to be strong with an increase of 8 over the prior fiscal year

outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future 

the increase in implementation services revenue is primarily related to the acquisition of gfsi which added 4452 in implementation revenue for the current year

 the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered in the current year compared to a year ago hardware revenue has been generally commensurate with the trends in license revenue however while hardware revenue has benefitted from the acquisition of gfsi it has not benefitted to the same degree as license revenue gfsi added hardware revenue of 1301 since its acquisition

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 the current year decrease in cost of license is generally commensurate with the related trends in license revenue cost of license depends greatly on third party reseller agreement software vendor costs during the current year these costs have decreased as a percentage of license revenue as complementary software sales that have associated third party vendor costs have decreased 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with the increase in support and services revenue combined the companies acquired during fiscal 2010 added 50480 to this line support and services gross profit margin has increased for the year due to cost control measures undertaken by the company and as eft support services with higher margins than other components of support and services revenue have become a larger percentage of that revenue line

cost of hardware has fluctuated in line with hardware revenue for the current year with slightly leaner margins resulting from a shift in sales mix

operating expenses 

 dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2010 fiscal year selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to current year acquisitions which added 10272 to this line during the current year the acquisitionrelated increases were partially offset by decreases in selling and marketing personnel costs throughout the rest of the company which were the result of costcutting measures undertaken by management

 we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses increased for the current year due primarily to current year acquisitions which added 8126 in expense during fiscal 2010 

 general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expenses increased for the year due to current year acquisitions including costs directly related to the acquisition transactions combined the acquired companies added 7700 of general and administrative costs during fiscal 2010 including 4237 of onetime acquisition transaction costs

interest income expense 

interest income decreased 79 from 781 to 161 due primarily to lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased 19 from 1357 to 1618 due to primarily to borrowings made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to consummate the acquisition of ipay

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 62926 or 348 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2010 compared with 54208 or 345 of income before income taxes fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to the expiration of the research and experimentation credit “re credit” effective january 1 2010 as well as increases in the rate at which deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in future years these increases were mostly offset by additional benefits received through an extensive analysis of the domestic production activities deduction irc section 199

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations increased moving from 103102 or 122 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 to 117870 or 138 per diluted share in fiscal 2010

discontinued operations 

there was no gain or loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2010 or 2009 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2009 revenues remained fairly even compared to the prior year as growth in support and services revenue was offset by decreases in license and hardware revenue this continuing shift in sales mix resulted in slightly leaner gross and operating margins as a result revenue that was consistent with the prior year yielded income from continuing operations that was down 2 in comparison to fiscal 2008

the us financial crisis is a primary concern at this time as it threatens our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions have decreased and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services we remain cautiously optimistic however with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and encouraging sales pipeline in specific areas our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we face these uncertain times with a strong balance sheet and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise when the economic rebound occurs 

revenue 

 license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

as a result of the current economic downturn we have seen some of our customers postpone making large capital investments in technology including software in addition our customers are often electing to contract for our products via an outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees or hardware during fiscal 2009 our core software products either had a decrease in license revenue or they remained even compared to the prior year in particular episys® our flagship core solution for credit unions experienced a decrease episys revenue has decreased as we have seen a decrease in the average size of contracts delivered during the year those contracts were smaller on average since they were made with smaller credit unions our license revenues for most of our complementary software solutions are also down compared to the prior year with the exception of certain of our item and document imaging solutions particularly synergy enterprise content management which has experienced 31 growth over the prior year

 

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services

there was strong growth in most support and service revenue components in fiscal 2009 inhouse support and other services increased partially as a result of license agreements for which the implementations were completed during the latest twelve months in addition because annual maintenance fees are based on supported institutions’ asset size inhouse support revenues increase as our customers’ assets grow 

eft support including atm and debit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and transaction processing services experienced the largest percentage growth as we have seen strong growth in our bill pay and enterprise payment solutions in addition we have seen continuing expansion of our customer basis for eft support as a whole

overall outsourcing services revenue grew only slightly however our core data processing revenue increased over 8 yeartodate compared to last year as our customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions these gains have been largely offset by a decrease in deconversion revenue and in item processing revenue we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue however we also expect itemprocessing revenue to continue to decline as fewer paper checks are processed in favor of check images and remote deposit capture 

the decrease in implementation services revenue is related to fewer convertmerger implementations for our bank customers due to the slowdown in bank merger and acquisition activity in the current market environment 

 the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered in the current year compared to a year ago hardware revenue has been negatively impacted by the decrease in the number of implementations of licensed core systems and the increase in outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware additionally during the prior fiscal year hardware revenue was increased by increased ibm system i upgrades which have not occurred at the same level in the current fiscal year

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 cost of license increased for the fiscal year due to greater third party reseller agreement software vendor costs these costs have led to gross profit margin on license revenue being lower than the prior year we expect this impact of third party software to continue to result in license gross profit margins that are lower than in prior years as third party software becomes a larger portion of our total license revenue 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with an increase in support and service revenue which led to gross profit margin consistent with that realized in the prior year

cost of hardware decreased for the year in line with the decrease in hardware revenue hardware gross profit margin remained at 27 for both years

operating expenses 

 dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2009 fiscal year the selling and marketing expenses decrease was due to lower marketing expenses including lower product promotion and trade show expenses than were incurred in the prior year overall selling and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue in comparison to a year ago commission expense has remained level compared to last year due to lower license and hardware revenues partially offset by growth in support and service revenue

 we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses decreased slightly for fiscal year 2009 primarily due to cost control measures undertaken by the company these measures included a reduction in the use of consultants and independent contractors compared to last year as a result of these efforts research and development expenses have remained level at 6 of total revenue

 general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expense have remained level for the current year compared to prior year as cost control measures have slowed the growth in personnel costs and reduced travel and other operating expenses general and administrative expenses have remained a consistent 6 of total revenue for both years

interest income expense 

interest income decreased 64 from 2145 to 781 due primarily to lower average invested balances coupled with lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense decreased 30 from 1928 to 1357 due to lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings on the revolving bank credit facilities

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 54208 or 345 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2009 compared with 59139 or 360 of income before income taxes fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the renewal of the research and experimentation credit “re credit” during fiscal year 2009 retroactive to january 1 2008 renewal of this credit had a significant tax benefit in fiscal year 2009 since retroactive renewal required the recording of an additional six months of credit during fiscal year 2009 related to fiscal year 2008 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations decreased slightly moving from 105287 or 117 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 to 103102 or 122 per diluted share in fiscal 2009

discontinued operations 

there was no gain or loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 loss on discontinued operations net of taxes was 1065 for fiscal 2008 the loss included a loss on the sale of banc insurance services inc and banc insurance agency inc of 2718 and a 1457 loss on the operations of the two companies the income tax benefit on the loss amount was 3110 

business segment discussion 

 in fiscal 2010 revenue increased 9 overall in the bank systems and services business segment compared to the prior year most of the increase is due to the acquisition of gfsi which added 44794 of revenue in the current year in addition eft support experienced organic revenue growth of nearly 10 over the prior year and data center maintenance had organic growth of 12 within the bank systems and services business segment gross profit margin increased from the prior year primarily due to cost control measures particularly related to personnel costs undertaken by management during fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2009 revenue remained essentially even in the bank systems and services business segment compared to the prior year support and service revenue increased for most lines particularly eft support which experienced 9 revenue growth and inhouse support which experienced 8 revenue growth the growth in these components was offset by a 14 decrease in license revenue and a 15 decrease in hardware revenue gross profit margin decreased as the mix of revenue shifted away from license revenue which carries the largest margins toward support and service revenue hardware profit margins remained even compared to fiscal 2008 

 in fiscal 2010 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 28 from fiscal 2009 support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced strong growth in most revenue components in particular eft support experienced 163 revenue growth over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of ptsi which added revenue of 33839 to current year revenue gross profit margins have decreased from the prior year as license revenue which carries the largest margins have decreased as a percentage of total revenue 

in fiscal 2009 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 1 from fiscal 2008 support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced strong growth in all revenue components and 18 percent growth overall in particular eft support experienced 32 revenue growth over the prior year the growth in support and service revenue was offset by decreases in both license and hardware revenue gross profit in this business segment remained even in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future

the companys cash and cash equivalents increased to 125518 at june 30 2010 from 118251 at june 30 2009 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

 cash provided by operations increased 12110 to 218698 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 as compared to 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 this increase is primarily attributable to increase in net income

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2010 was 505715 and includes a net cash outlay for acquisitions of 426652 capital expenditures of 54509 and capitalized software development of 25586 during fiscal 2009 cash used in investing activities was 59227 and included contingent consideration paid on prior years’ acquisitions of 3027 capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were 31562 and cash used in the development of software was 24684

net cash from financing activities for the current fiscal year was 294284 and includes 303160 net borrowing on our credit facilities proceeds of 28522 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and 661 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises cash from financing activities was partially offset by the payment of dividends of 30461 and debt acquisition costs of 7598 during fiscal 2009 net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for 58405 the payment of dividends of 26903 and 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and 349 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises

at june 30 2010 the company had negative working capital of 53883 however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 264219 which primarily relates to our annual inhouse maintenance agreements the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance in addition we continue to have access to unused lines of credit in excess of 40000 and continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition

us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments over the last two years in the mortgage markets and the general economy while the effects of these events continue to impact our customers we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves of shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facility the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2010 there were 14407 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 5584 additional shares the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2010 is 309585 

on august 23 2010 the company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0095 per share on its common stock payable on september 22 2010 to stockholders of record on september 7 2010 current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the company’s financial picture continues to be favorable

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement on financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” which replaces sfas no 141 and has since been incorporated into the accounting standards codification “asc” as asc 80510 asc 80510 establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and the goodwill acquired the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination relative to sfas 141r the fasb issued fsp 141r1 on april 1 2009 which is now incorporated in asc 80520 asc 80520 eliminates the requirement under fas 141r to record assets and liabilities at the acquisition date for noncontractual contingencies at fair value where it is deemed “morelikelythannot” that an asset or liability would result under asc 80520 such assets and liabilities would only need to be recorded where the fair value can be determined during the measurement period or where it is probable that an asset or liability exists at the acquisition date and the amount of fair value can be reasonably determined asc 80510 was effective for the company on july 1 2009 the adoption of asc 80510 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1423 “ determination of the useful life of intangible assets” which is now incorporated into asc 35030 this position amends asc 350 regarding the factors that should be considered in developing the useful lives for intangible assets with renewal or extension provisions asc 35030 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions when determining the useful life of an intangible asset in the absence of such experience an entity shall consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension adjusted for entityspecific factors asc 35030 also requires an entity to disclose information regarding the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with an intangible asset are affected by the entity’s intent andor ability to renew or extend the agreement asc 35030 is effective for qualifying intangible assets acquired by the company on or after july 1 2009 the application of fsp1423 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements upon adoption

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 168 “ the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 162” which is now incorporated as asc 10510 and establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” asc 10510 explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants asc 10510 was effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 but it did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements

license fee revenue for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately in the event that we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted

support and service fee revenue implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates

outsourced data processing services and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered

hardware revenue hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period

depreciation and amortization expense 

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment for commercial software products determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

forward looking statements 

except for the historical information contained herein the matters discussed in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other portions of this report contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws actual results are subject to risks and uncertainties including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry which could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated the risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the matters detailed in “risk factors” in item 1a of this report undue reliance should not be placed on the forwardlooking statements the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements

potential risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect the company include the financial health of the financial services industry our ability to continue or effectively manage growth adapting our products and services to changes in technology changes in our strategic relationships price competition loss of key employees consolidation in the banking or credit union industry increased government regulation network or internet security problems operational problems in our outsourcing facilities and others listed in “risk factors” at item 1a




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 

based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june 30 2010 a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in fiscal 2011 by less than 3000

providing commercial banks and credit unions with core software systems that provide excellent functionality and support inhouse and outsourced operating environments with identical functionality 

expanding each core customer relationship by crossselling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems 

maintaining a companywide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers expectations and generates rewarding levels of customer retention 

capitalizing on our focused diversification acquisition strategy 

focused diversification acquisition strategy 

jhas acquisition strategy which complements and accelerates our organic growth focuses on successful companies that provide indemand products and services excellent customer relationships and strong management teams and employee bases 

historically our acquisition strategy focused on companies that 

expanded our base of core financial institution customers 

expanded our suite of complementary products and services that were cross sold almost exclusively to existing customers 

enabled our entry into adjacent markets within financial services industry andor 

provided additional outsourcing capabilitiesopportunities 

in 2004 we adopted our focused diversification acquisition strategy and began acquiring companies and highly specialized products that are

sold to existing core customers 

sold outside jhas base of core bank and credit union customers to financial services organizations of all charters and asset sizes 

selectively sold outside the financial services industry to diverse corporate entities and 

selectively sold internationally 

since our focused diversification strategy was adopted jha has completed 16 acquisitions that support it and assembled three distinct product suites that enable users to

generate additional revenue and growth opportunities 

increase security and mitigate operational risks and or 

control operating costs 

these products and services enable us to expand our reach well beyond our traditional markets with solutions that are appropriate for virtually any financial services organization including thousands of institutions that we previously did not sell to

most of the acquired companies and their respective products and services have been consolidated into our profitstars brand today profitstars products and services collectively represent more than 7500 domestic and international implementations outside of our core solution customer base 

following are some of the acquisitions that have been made in the last six fiscal years to support jhas focused diversification

most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 percent to 20 percent of the respective products software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 60 days prior to contract expiration

backlog

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period

backlog as of june 30 2009 totaled 2894 million consisting of 668 million for inhouse products and services and 2225 million for outsourcing services approximately 1639 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2009 is not expected to be realized during fiscal year 2010 due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2008 totaled 2574 million and consisted of 631 million for inhouse products and services and 1943 million for outsourcing services

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal year 2010 the backlog is expected to remain relatively constant due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities

competition

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jhas current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future

jack henry banking competes with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks including fidelity national information services inc and fiserv inc symitar competes with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc open solutions inc and harland financial solutions  ultradata profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our companys source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology

 item 1a risk factors

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired

our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry given this concentration we may be particularly exposed to the current global economic recession if the economic environment remains poor it may result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their financial failure

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data tapes can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business

we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the last few years and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public without additional acquisitions we may not be able to grow and to develop new products and services as quickly as we have in the past to meet the competition if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

consolidation of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 8200 commercial and savings banks and 8100 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union association and the office of thrift supervision among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability

as technology becomes less expensive and more advanced purchase prices of hardware are declining and our revenues and profits from remarketing arrangements may decrease computer hardware technology is rapidly developing hardware manufacturers are producing less expensive and more powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into the future as computer hardware becomes less expensive revenues and profits derived from our hardware remarketing may decrease and become a smaller portion of our revenues and profits 

an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could damage our relationship with customers and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers

if our strategic relationship with ibm were terminated it could have a negative impact on the continuing success of our business we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers under an ibm business partner agreement and resell maintenance on ibm hardware products to our customers much of our software is designed to be compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally modify our strategic relationship our relationship with our customers and our revenues and earnings could suffer we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign existing products or develop new products for new hardware platforms 

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may decrease overall margins we continue to experience a trend of a greater proportion of our products being sold as outsourcing services rather than inhouse licenses we realize lower margins on service revenues than on license revenues thus if service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be impacted 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

overview 

background and overview

we provide integrated computer systems for inhouse and outsourced data processing to commercial banks credit unions and other financial institutions we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market together with compatible computer hardware to these financial institutions we also perform data conversion and software implementation services for our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented for our customers who prefer not to make an upfront capital investment in software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our eight data centers in six physical locations and 12 itemprocessing centers located throughout the united states

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 and compare fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007

we derive revenues from three primary sources 

 software licenses 

 support and service fees which include implementation services and

 hardware sales which includes all nonsoftware remarketed products

over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 535191 in fiscal 2005 to 745593 in fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations has grown from 76050 in fiscal 2005 to 103102 in fiscal 2009 this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services for approximately 9800 customers who utilize our software systems as of june 30 2009

since the start of fiscal 2007 we have completed 3 acquisitions all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 

support and services fees are generated from implementation services contracted with us by the customer ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software and from providing outsourced data processing services and electronic funds transfer eft support services  outsourcing services are performed through our data and item processing centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and eft support services are primarily derived from monthly usage or transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers 

cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with license fee revenue 

cost of services represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item processing centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft services and direct operation costs 

we have entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services to our customers cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers 

we have two business segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales

results of operations

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008

in fiscal 2009 revenues remained fairly even compared to the prior year as growth in support and services revenue was offset by decreases in license and hardware revenue this continuing shift in sales mix resulted in slightly leaner gross and operating margins as a result revenue that was consistent with the prior year yielded income from continuing operations that was down 2 in comparison to fiscal 2008

the us financial crisis is a primary concern at this time as it threatens our customers and our industry the profits of many financial institutions have decreased and this has resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services we remain cautiously optimistic however with increasing portions of our business coming from recurring revenue increases in backlog and encouraging sales pipeline in specific areas our customers will continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times have an even greater need for some of our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency we face these uncertain times with a strong balance sheet and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service and we believe that we are well positioned to address current opportunities as well as those which will arise when the economic rebound occurs 

revenue 

 license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

as a result of the current economic downturn we have seen some of our customers postpone making large capital investments in technology including software in addition our customers are often electing to contract for our products via an outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license agreement our outsourced delivery does not require our customers to make a large upfront capital investment in license fees or hardware during fiscal 2009 our core software products either had a decrease in license revenue or they remained even compared to the prior year in particular episys® our flagship core solution for credit unions experienced a decrease episys revenue has decreased as we have seen a decrease in the average size of contracts delivered during the year those contracts were smaller on average since they were made with smaller credit unions our license revenues for most of our complementary software solutions are also down compared to the prior year with the exception of certain of our item and document imaging solutions particularly synergy enterprise content management which has experienced 31 growth over the prior year

  

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services

there was strong growth in most support and service revenue components in fiscal 2009 inhouse support and other services increased partially as a result of license agreements for which the implementations were completed during the latest twelve months in addition because annual maintenance fees are based on supported institutions asset size inhouse support revenues increase as our customers assets grow 

eft support including atm and debit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and transaction processing services experienced the largest percentage growth as we have seen strong growth in our bill pay and enterprise payment solutions in addition we have seen continuing expansion of our customer basis for eft support as a whole

overall outsourcing services revenue grew only slightly however our core data processing revenue increased over 8 yeartodate compared to last year as our customers continue to choose outsourcing for the delivery of our solutions these gains have been largely offset by a decrease in deconversion revenue and in item processing revenue we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue however we also expect itemprocessing revenue to continue to decline as fewer paper checks are processed in favor of check images and remote deposit capture 

the decrease in implementation services revenue is related to fewer convertmerger implementations for our bank customers due to the slowdown in bank merger and acquisition activity in the current market environment 

 the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in the number of hardware systems and components delivered in the current year compared to a year ago hardware revenue has been negatively impacted by the decrease in the number of implementations of licensed core systems and the increase in outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware additionally during the prior fiscal year hardware revenue was increased by increased ibm system i upgrades which have not occurred at the same level in the current fiscal year

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 cost of license increased for the fiscal year due to greater third party reseller agreement software vendor costs these costs have led to gross profit margin on license revenue being lower than the prior year we expect this impact of third party software to continue to result in license gross profit margins that are lower than in prior years as third party software becomes a larger portion of our total license revenue 

cost of support and service increased for the year commensurate with an increase in support and service revenue which led to gross profit margin consistent with that realized in the prior year

cost of hardware decreased for the year in line with the decrease in hardware revenue hardware gross profit margin remained at 27 for both years

operating expenses

 dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2009 fiscal year the selling and marketing expenses decrease was due to lower marketing expenses including lower product promotion and trade show expenses than were incurred in the prior year overall selling and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue in comparison to a year ago commission expense has remained level compared to last year due to lower license and hardware revenues partially offset by growth in support and service revenue

 we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses decreased slightly for fiscal year 2009 primarily due to cost control measures undertaken by the company these measures included a reduction in the use of consultants and independent contractors compared to last year as a result of these efforts research and development expenses have remained level at 6 of total revenue

 general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expense have remained level for the current year compared to prior year as cost control measures have slowed the growth in personnel costs and reduced travel and other operating expenses general and administrative expenses have remained a consistent 6 of total revenue for both years

interest income expense

interest income decreased 64 from 2145 to 781 due primarily to lower average invested balances coupled with lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense decreased 30 from 1928 to 1357 due to lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings on the revolving bank credit facilities

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes was 54208 or 345 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2009 compared with 59139 or 360 of income before income taxes fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the renewal of the research and experimentation credit re credit during fiscal year 2009 retroactive to january 1 2008 renewal of this credit had a significant tax benefit in fiscal year 2009 since retroactive renewal required the recording of an additional six months of credit during fiscal year 2009 related to fiscal year 2008 

income from continuing operations

income from continuing operations decreased slightly moving from 105287 or 117 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 to 103102 or 122 per diluted share in fiscal 2009

discontinued operations

there was no gain or loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 loss on discontinued operations net of taxes was 1065 for fiscal 2008 the loss included a loss on the sale of banc insurance services inc and banc insurance agency inc of 2718 and a 1457 loss on the operations of the two companies the income tax benefit on the loss amount was 3110 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007

fiscal 2008 showed strong growth in support and service revenues tempered somewhat by leaner gross and operating margins as a result an 11 increase in total revenue yielded income from continuing operations that was flat in comparison to fiscal 2007 

revenue 

 license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

license revenue decreased by 2850 compared to last fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in the number of new license agreements and an overall decrease in the average transaction size in comparison to the prior fiscal year when compared with last year many of our software solutions experienced a decrease in license revenue those products that had the most significant decreases included yellow hammer fraud detective™ our fraud detectionprevention solution silverlake ® our flagship core software solution for larger banks and synergy our enterprise content management solution  a significant portion of the decrease in license revenue can be attributed to the continuing shift in demand by banks and credit unions toward our outsourcing services from an inhouse delivery while many products had decreases in revenue during the current fiscal year some products did very well including episys® our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions and yellow hammer™ bsa our new compliance and risk mitigation solution

  

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services including atm and debit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and check 21 transaction processing services

there was strong growth in all of the support and service revenue components inhouse support and other services increased partially as a result of increased implementations of recently acquired products in addition because annual maintenance fees are based on supported institutions asset size inhouse support revenues increase as our customers assets grow eft support which includes atmdebit card processing online bill pay remote deposit capture and check 21 transaction processing services experienced the largest percentage growth due to increased customer activity and expansion of our customer base outsourcing services for banks and credit unions also continue to drive revenue growth at a strong pace as we add new bank and credit union customers and increase volume implementation services revenue increased during the year partially due to implementations of newly acquired or developed software products as well as an increase in merger conversions for existing customers that acquired other financial institutions

 the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue increased slightly in the current fiscal year because a small decrease in the sale of major hardware components was offset by slight increases in revenue from the sale of financial institution forms and supplies and from hardware maintenance contracts

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 cost of license increased for the fiscal year due to greater third party reseller agreement software vendor costs gross profit margin on license revenue decreased because a larger percentage of the revenue from licenses was attributable to these sales under reseller agreements where the gross margins are significantly lower than on our owned products cost of support and service increased for the year primarily due to additional personnel costs costs related to the expansion of infrastructure including depreciation amortization and maintenance contracts and increases in the direct costs of providing services such as transaction processing charges and the cost of third party maintenance as compared to last year these increases were commensurate with the increase in support and service revenue the gross profit margin decreased to 37 from 38 in support and service cost of hardware decreased for the year hardware gross profit margin increased slightly due to sales mix

operating expenses

 dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2008 fiscal year the selling and marketing expenses increase was due to growth in personnel costs particularly commission expenses on sales of services which resulted from increased services revenue selling and marketing expenses remained steady for both years at 8 of total revenue

 we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses grew primarily due to employee costs associated with an 11 increase in headcount for ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in addition recent acquisitions have research and development expenses that exceed the average for the remainder of the company which has contributed to the increase from the prior fiscal year research and development expenses increased slightly to 6 of total revenue from 5 in fiscal 2007

 general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expense increased primarily due to employee costs associated with a 4 increase in headcount and to an increase in professional services fees fees for accounting legal and business consultants also impacting the increase was growth in travel and lodging expenses including the cost of aircraft fuel general and administrative costs remained at 6 of total revenue for both fiscal years

interest income expense

interest income decreased 37 from 3406 to 2145 due primarily to lower average invested balances coupled with lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased 10 from 1757 to 1928 due to higher average outstanding borrowings on the revolving bank credit facilities

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes was 59139 or 360 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2008 compared with 56033 or 347 of income before income taxes fiscal 2007 the increase was due to the renewal of the research and experimentation credit re credit during fiscal year 2007 retroactive to january 1 2006 renewal of this credit had a significant tax benefit in fiscal year 2007 since retroactive renewal required the recording of an additional six months of credit during fiscal year 2007 related to fiscal year 2006 in addition the re credit expired as of december 31 2007 which also contributed to the increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2008

income from continuing operations

income from continuing operations remained relatively flat moving from 105644 or 115 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 to 105287 or 117 per diluted share in fiscal 2008

discontinued operations

loss on discontinued operations net of taxes was 1065 for fiscal 2008 the loss included a loss on the sale of banc insurance services inc and banc insurance agency inc of 2718 and a 1457 loss on the operations of the two companies the income tax benefit on the loss amount was 3110 the loss on operations of the disposed companies for fiscal 2007 included a loss from operations of 1474 netted with the income tax benefit of 511

business segment discussion 

 in fiscal 2009 revenue remained essentially even in the bank systems and services business segment compared to the prior year support and service revenue increased for most lines particularly eft support which experienced 9 revenue growth and inhouse support which experienced 8 revenue growth the growth in these components was offset by a 14 decrease in license revenue and a 15 decrease in hardware revenue gross profit margin decreased as the mix of revenue shifted away from license revenue which carries the largest margins toward support and service revenue hardware profit margins remained even compared to fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2008 the revenue increase in the bank systems and services business segment is primarily due to continued growth in support and service revenue particularly eft support which experienced 29 revenue growth and inhouse support which experienced 16 revenue growth the growth in these components was partially offset by a 13 decrease in license revenue gross profit margin decreased as the mix of revenue shifted away from license revenue which carries the largest margins toward support and service revenue hardware revenue decreased by 2 however a shift in sales mix during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 led to a slightly higher hardware margin 

 in fiscal 2009 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 1 from fiscal 2008 support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced strong growth in all revenue components and 18 percent growth overall in particular eft support experienced 32 revenue growth over the prior year the growth in support and service revenue was offset by decreases in both license and hardware revenue gross profit in this business segment remained even in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2008 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14 from fiscal 2007 all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys® our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions experienced strong sales throughout the year support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in inhouse support gross profit in this business segment increased 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to the increase in license revenue which carries the highest margins 

liquidity and capital resources

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future

the companys cash and cash equivalents increased to 118251 at june 30 2009 from 65565 at june 30 2008 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

 cash provided by operations increased 25587 to 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 200 9 as compared to 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of 21214 this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years further we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was 59227 and includes 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years acquisitions cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of 48109 plus 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years acquisitions capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were 31562 compared to 31105 for fiscal 2008 cash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was 24684 compared to 23736 during the prior year

net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for 58405 the payment of dividends of 26903 and 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises during fiscal 2008 net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for 100996 the payment of dividends of 24683 and 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises

beginning during fiscal 2008 us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets and particularly the markets for subprime mortgagebacked securities since that time these and other such developments have resulted in a broad global economic downturn while we as is the case with most companies have experienced the effects of this downturn we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves of shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facility the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2008 there were 11301 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3690 additional shares on august 25 2008 the companys board of directors approved a 5000 share increase to the stock repurchase authorization during fiscal 2009 the company repurchased 3106 treasury shares for 58405 the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2009 is 309585 at june 30 2009 there were 14407 shares in treasury stock and the company had the authority to repurchase up to 5584 additional shares

subsequent to june 30 2009 the companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0085 per share on its common stock payable on september 17 2009 to stockholders of record on september 4 2009 current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the companys financial picture continues to be favorable

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r  business combinations sfas 141r which replaces sfas no 141 sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquire and the goodwill acquired the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination relative to sfas 141r the fasb issued fsp 141r1 on april 1 2009 fsp 141r1 eliminates the requirement under fas 141r to record assets or liabilities at the acquisition date for noncontractual contingencies at fair value where it is deemed morelikelythannot that an asset or liability would result under fsp 141r1 such assets and liabilities would only need to be recorded where the fair value can be determined during the measurement period or where it is probable that an asset or liability exists at the acquisition date and the amount of fair value can be reasonably determined sfas 141r is effective for the company on july 1 2009 sfas 141r will have an impact on the companys accounting for business combinations on a prospective basis once adopted however the materiality of that impact cannot be determined at this time

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1423  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 1423 this pronouncement amends sfas no 142 regarding the factors that should be considered in developing the useful lives for intangible assets with renewal or extension provisions fsp 1423 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions when determining the useful life of an intangible asset in the absence of such experience an entity shall consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension adjusted for entityspecific factors fsp 1423 also requires an entity to disclose information regarding the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with an intangible asset are affected by the entitys intent andor ability to renew or extend the arrangement fsp 1423 will be effective for qualifying intangible assets acquired by the company on or after july 1 2009 the application of fsp 1423 is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial statements however it could impact future transactions entered into by the company

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 168  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 162 sfas 168 which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles sfas 168 explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants sfas 168 will become effective in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010 and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial statements 

critical accounting policies

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 104 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 0021 eitf 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements

license fee revenue for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or elements none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements sop 972 as amended by sop 989 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately in the event that we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized the residual method allowed by sop 989 under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted

support and service fee revenue implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customers employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates

outsourced data processing services and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered

hardware revenue hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under arrangements as defined by sop 972 to the extent hardware revenue is subject to sop 972 and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery for these transactions the company follows the guidance provided in emerging issues task force issue eitf no 9919  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  based upon the indicators provided within this consensus the company records the revenue related to our dropship transactions at gross and the related costs are included in cost of hardware the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period

depreciation and amortization expense

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the companys future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment for commercial software products determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately 18 percent to 20 percent of the respective products software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least 60 days prior to contract expiration

backlog

backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period

backlog as of june 30 2008 totaled 2574 million consisting of 631 million for inhouse products and services and 1943 million for outsourcing services approximately 1430 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of june 30 2008 is not expected to be realized during fiscal year 2009 due to the longterm nature of many outsourcing contracts backlog as of june 30 2007 totaled 2393 million and consisted of 681 million for inhouse products and services and 1712 million for outsourcing services

our inhouse backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal year 2008 the backlog is expected to remain constant due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities

competition

the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jhas current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references during the last decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future

jack henry banking competes with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks including fidelity information services inc fiserv inc and metavante symitar competes with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to credit unions including fidelity information services inc fiserv inc open solutions inc and harland financial solutions  ultradata profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities 

intellectual property patents and trademarks 

although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our companys source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation all financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision we must ensure that our products and services comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers including but not limited to those mandated by federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules the privacy of consumer financial information regulations usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the grammleachbliley act and the community reinvestment act the compliance of jhas products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design the classification of customers and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services it is not possible to predict the impact these regulations any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations could have on our business in the future

 item 1a risk factors

the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired

changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their financial failure

competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete

if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on standard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data tapes can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business

we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the last few years and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public without additional acquisitions we may not be able to grow and to develop new products and services as quickly as we have in the past to meet the competition if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets

the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

consolidation of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately 8400 commercial and savings banks and 8200 credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs 

the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union association and the office of thrift supervision among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined 

the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability

as technology becomes less expensive and more advanced purchase prices of hardware are declining and our revenues and profits from remarketing arrangements may decrease computer hardware technology is rapidly developing hardware manufacturers are producing less expensive and more powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into the future as computer hardware becomes less expensive revenues and profits derived from our hardware remarketing may decrease and become a smaller portion of our revenues and profits 

an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could damage our relationship with customers and may cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption in addition a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers

if our strategic relationship with ibm were terminated it could have a negative impact on the continuing success of our business we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers under an ibm business partner agreement and resell maintenance on ibm hardware products to our customers much of our software is designed to be compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally modify our strategic relationship our relationship with our customers and our revenues and earnings could suffer we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign existing products or develop new products for new hardware platforms

if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 

expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may decrease overall margins we continue to experience a trend of a greater proportion of our products being sold as outsourcing services rather than inhouse licenses we realize lower margins on service revenues than on license revenues thus if service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be impacted 

failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

overview 

background and overview

we provide integrated computer systems for inhouse and outsourced data processing to commercial banks credit unions and other financial institutions we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market together with compatible computer hardware to these financial institutions we also perform data conversion and software implementation services for our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented for our customers who prefer not to make an upfront capital investment in software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our eight data centers in six physical locations and 20 itemprocessing centers located throughout the united states

a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007 and compare fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006

we derive revenues from three primary sources 

 software licenses 

 support and service fees which include implementation services and

 hardware sales which includes all nonsoftware remarketed products

over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 467415 in fiscal 2004 to 742926 in fiscal 2008 net income has grown from 62315 in fiscal 2004 to 104222 in fiscal 2008 this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services for approximately 2300 customers who utilize our core software systems as of june 30 2008

since the start of fiscal 2004 we have completed 16 acquisitions all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 

support and services fees are generated from implementation services contracted with us by the customer ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software and from providing outsourced data processing services and electronic funds transfer eft support services  outsourcing services are performed through our data and item processing centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and eft support services are primarily derived from monthly usage or transaction fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers 

cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with license fee revenue 

cost of services represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item processing centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft services and direct operation costs 

we have entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services to our customers cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers 

we have two business segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales

results of operations

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007

fiscal 2008 showed strong growth in support and service revenues tempered somewhat by leaner gross and operating margins as a result an 11 increase in total revenue yielded income from continuing operations that was flat in comparison to fiscal 2007 

revenue 

 

license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

license revenue decreased by 2850 compared to last fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in the number of new license agreements and an overall decrease in the average transaction size in comparison to the prior fiscal year when compared with last year many of our software solutions experienced a decrease in license revenue those products that had the most significant decreases included yellow hammer fraud detective™ our fraud detectionprevention solution silverlake ® our flagship core software solution for larger banks and synergy our enterprise content management solution  a significant portion of the decrease in license revenue can be attributed to the continuing shift in demand by banks and credit unions toward our outsourcing services from an inhouse delivery while many products had decreases in revenue during the current fiscal year some products did very well including episys® our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions and yellow hammer™ bsa our new compliance and risk mitigation solution

 

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services including atm and debit card transaction processing online bill payment services remote deposit capture and check 21 transaction processing services

there was strong growth in all of the support and service revenue components inhouse support and other services increased partially as a result of increased implementations of recently acquired products in addition because annual maintenance fees are based on supported institutions asset size inhouse support revenues increase as our customers assets grow eft support which includes atmdebit card processing online bill pay remote deposit capture and check 21 transaction processing services experienced the largest percentage growth due to increased customer activity and expansion of our customer base outsourcing services for banks and credit unions also continue to drive revenue growth at a strong pace as we add new bank and credit union customers and increase volume implementation services revenue increased during the year partially due to implementations of newly acquired or developed software products as well as an increase in merger conversions for existing customers that acquired other financial institutions

 

the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue increased slightly in the current fiscal year because a small decrease in the sale of major hardware components was offset by slight increases in revenue from the sale of financial institution forms and supplies and from hardware maintenance contracts

cost of sales and gross profit 

cost of license represents the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements these costs are recognized when license revenue is recognized cost of support and service represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers eft processing services and direct operating costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue is recognized ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers are recognized as they are incurred

 cost of license increased for the fiscal year due to greater third party reseller agreement software vendor costs gross profit margin on license revenue decreased because a larger percentage of the revenue from licenses was attributable to these sales under reseller agreements where the gross margins are significantly lower than on our owned products cost of support and service increased for the year primarily due to additional personnel costs costs related to the expansion of infrastructure including depreciation amortization and maintenance contracts and increases in the direct costs of providing services such as transaction processing charges and the cost of third party maintenance as compared to last year these increases were commensurate with the increase in support and service revenue the gross profit margin decreased to 37 from 38 in support and service cost of hardware decreased for the year hardware gross profit margin increased slightly due to sales mix

operating expenses

 

dedicated sales forces inside sales teams technical sales support teams and channel partners conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers our sales executives are responsible for pursuing lead generation activities for new core customers our account executives nurture longterm relationships with our client base and cross sell our many complementary products and services 

for the 2008 fiscal year the selling and marketing expenses increase was due to growth in personnel costs particularly commission expenses on sales of services which resulted from increased services revenue selling and marketing expenses remained steady for both years at 8 of total revenue

 

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings typically we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customerdriven 

research and development expenses grew primarily due to employee costs associated with an 11 increase in headcount for ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in addition recent acquisitions have research and development expenses that exceed the average for the remainder of the company which has contributed to the increase from the prior fiscal year research and development expenses increased slightly to 6 of total revenue from 5 in fiscal 2007

 

general and administrative costs include all expenses related to finance legal human resources plus all administrative costs general and administrative expense increased primarily due to employee costs associated with a 4 increase in headcount and to an increase in professional services fees fees for accounting legal and business consultants also impacting the increase was growth in travel and lodging expenses including the cost of aircraft fuel general and administrative costs remained at 6 of total revenue for both fiscal years

interest income expense

interest income decreased 37 from 3406 to 2145 due primarily to lower average invested balances coupled with lower interest rates on invested balances interest expense increased 10 from 1757 to 1928 due to higher average outstanding borrowings on the revolving bank credit facilities

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes was 59139 or 360 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2008 compared with 56033 or 347 of income before income taxes fiscal 2007 the increase was due to the renewal of the research and experimentation credit re credit during fiscal year 2007 retroactive to january 1 2006 renewal of this credit had a significant tax benefit in fiscal year 2007 since retroactive renewal required the recording of an additional six months of credit during fiscal year 2007 related to fiscal year 2006 in addition the re credit expired as of december 31 2007 which also contributed to the increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2008

income from continuing operations

income from continuing operations remained relatively flat moving from 105644 or 115 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 to 105287 or 117 per diluted share in fiscal 2008

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006

fiscal 2007 showed strong growth in support and service revenues and improved gross and operating margins tempered somewhat by decreases in software license revenues this performance allowed us to leverage a 13 increase in total revenue to a 16 increase in net income 

revenue 

 

license revenue represents the delivery and acceptance of application software systems contracted by us with the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location

license revenue decreased by 7611 compared to last fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in the number of new license agreements and an overall decrease in the average transaction size in comparison to the prior fiscal year when compared with last year many of our software solutions experienced a decrease in license revenue those products that had the most significant decreases included yellow hammer fraud detective™ our fraud detectionprevention solution silverlake ® our flagship core software solution for larger banks netteller online banking™ our bankbranded internet banking solution and episys® our flagship core software solution for larger credit unions  a significant portion of the decrease in license revenue can be attributed to the continuing shift in demand from banks and credit unions toward our outsourcing services from an inhouse delivery which do not require software license agreements another contributing factor is the market penetration we have with several of our products including episys and netteller which has caused us to anticipate reduced license sales for these products compared to prior years

 

 support and service revenues are generated from implementation services including conversion installation configuration and training annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software outsourced data processing services and eft support services

there was strong growth in all of the support and service revenue components inhouse support and other services increased partially as a result of increased implementations of recently acquired products in addition because annual maintenance fees are based on supported institutions asset size inhouse support revenues increase as our customers assets grow eft support which includes atmdebit card processing online bill pay remote deposit capture and check 21 transaction processing services experienced the largest percentage and dollar growth outsourcing services for banks and credit unions also continue to drive revenue growth at a strong pace as we add new bank and credit union customers and increase volume implementation services revenue increased during the year primarily due to an increase in the number of inhouse implementations as well as an increase in merger conversions for existing customers that acquired other financial institutions

 

the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware hardware maintenance and related services to our customers revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

hardware revenue increased mainly due to an increase in the number of hardware systems and components delivered in the year compared to last fiscal year in particular there has been a significant increase in revenue from hardware components used in our remote deposit capture product for imaging and exchanging of checks

income from continuing operations

income from continuing operations increased 16 from 90863 or 097 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 to 105643 or 116 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 

business segment discussion 

 in fiscal 2008 the revenue increase in the bank systems and services business segment is primarily due to continued growth in support and service revenue particularly eft support which experienced 29 revenue growth and inhouse support which experienced 16 revenue growth the growth in these components was partially offset by a 13 decrease in license revenue gross profit margin decreased as the mix of revenue shifted away from license revenue which carries the largest margins toward support and service revenue hardware revenue decreased by 2 however a shift in sales mix during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 led to a slightly higher hardware margin 

in fiscal 2007 the revenue increase in the bank systems and services business segment was primarily due to continued growth in support and service revenue particularly eft support which experienced 40 revenue growth gross profit margin remained flat as growth generated by increasing eft support revenue which carries higher margins than other components of support and service revenue was offset by decreasing license profit margin profit from license revenue decreased due to both a decrease in revenue and to an increase in the number of sales that were subject to third party seller agreements hardware revenue increased by 11 however lower vendor rebates during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 led to a slightly lower hardware margin

 

in fiscal 2008 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14 from fiscal 2007 all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys® our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions experienced strong sales throughout the year support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced growth in eft support 34 and in inhouse support 10 gross profit in this business segment increased 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to the increase in license revenue which carries the highest margins 

in fiscal 2007 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased slightly from fiscal 2006 this increase is mainly due to growth in support and service revenue mostly offset by decreases in license and hardware revenue support and service revenue which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment experienced growth in eft support 26 and in outsourcing revenue 24 gross profit in this business segment remained flat in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006

liquidity and capital resources

we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements we expect this trend to continue in the future

the companys cash and cash equivalents decreased to 65565 at june 30 2008 from 88617 at june 30 2007 

the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

 

cash provided by operations increased 6754 to 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 200 8 as compared to 174247 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that do not have a corresponding cash outflow such as depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total net income

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of 48109 plus 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years acquisitions during fiscal 2007 payments for acquisitions totaled 34006 plus 5301 paid on earnouts and other acquisition adjustments capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were 31105 compared to 34202 for fiscal 2007 cash used for software development in fiscal 2008 was 23736 compared to 20743 during the prior year

net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for 100996 the payment of dividends of 24683 and 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises during fiscal 2007 net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of our common stock for 98413 and the payment of dividends of 21685 as in the current year cash used in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock of 29212 4640 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and 19388 net borrowings on revolving credit facilities

at june 30 2008 the company had negative working capital of 11418 however the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of 212375 the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance therefore we do not anticipate any liquidity problems to result from this condition

us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have recently been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets and particularly the markets for subprime mortgagebacked securities while we believe it is too early to predict what effect if any these developments may have we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit

the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock under this authorization the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves of shortterm borrowings on its existing credit facility the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time at june 30 2007 there were 7101 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 2890 shares on february 4 2008 the companys board of directors approved a 5000 share increase to the stock repurchase authorization on august 25 2008 subsequent to the fiscal year 2008 ending the companys board of directors approved an additional 5000 share increase to the stock repurchase authorization during fiscal 2008 the company repurchased 4200 shares for 100996 the total cost of treasury shares at june 30 2008 is 251180 at june 30 2008 there were 11301 shares in treasury stock and the company had the authority to repurchase up to 3690 additional shares

subsequent to june 30 2008 the companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of 075 per share on its common stock payable on september 19 2008 to stockholders of record on september 5 2008 current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the companys financial picture continues to be favorable

an unsecured revolving bank credit facility allows shortterm borrowings of up to 150000 which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to 225000 the unsecured revolving bank credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to a libor or b an alternate base rate the greater of a the federal funds rate plus 05 or b the prime rate plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the companys leverage ratio the unsecured revolving credit line terminates may 31 2012 at june 30 2008 the outstanding revolving bank credit facility balance was 70000 this outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average rate of 311 

the company has entered into various capital lease obligations for the use of certain computer equipment included in property and equipment are related assets of 1169 less accumulated depreciation of 651 at june 30 2008 201 was outstanding of which 177 was included in current maturities maturities of capital lease payments by fiscal year are 177 in fiscal 2009 and 24 in fiscal 2010

contractual obligations and other commitments 

at june 30 2008 the companys total off balance sheet contractual obligations were 30240 this balance consists of 28496 of longterm operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2008 to 2017 and the remaining 1744 is for purchase commitments related to property and equipment the company also has contingent earnout obligations of up to 12752 to the sellers in an acquisition completed during fiscal year 2005 and an acquisition completed in fiscal 2008 these amounts are payable over the next two years based upon net operating income achieved by the individual acquired business units the table excludes 4793 of liabilities under the financial accounting standards boards interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for the company beginning july 1 2008 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding and amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 sfas 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value under sfas 159 a company may elect to use fair value to measure its financial assets and liabilities if the use of fair value is elected any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value at the adoption date unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings subsequent to the adoption of sfas 159 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings sfas 159 is effective for the company beginning july 1 2008 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r  business combinations sfas 141r which replaces sfas no 141 sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquire and the goodwill acquired the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for the company on july 1 2009 sfas 141r will have an impact on the companys accounting for business combinations on a prospective basis once adopted however the materiality of that impact cannot be determined

critical accounting policies

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements

we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 989 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 104 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 0021 eitf 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements

license fee revenue for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or elements none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements sop 972 as amended by sop 989 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately in the event that we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized the residual method allowed by sop 989 under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted

support and service fee revenue implementation services are generally for installation training implementation and configuration these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours

maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates

outsourced data processing services and atm debit card and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered

hardware revenue hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under arrangements as defined by sop 972 to the extent hardware revenue is subject to sop 972 and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery for these transactions the company follows the guidance provided in emerging issues task force issue eitf no 9919  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  based upon the indicators provided within this consensus the company records the revenue related to our dropship transactions at gross and the related costs are included in cost of hardware the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period

depreciation and amortization expense

the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the companys future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

capitalization of software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment for commercial software products determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 

estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also fin 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results 

assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 

we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 

as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

 502 billion  in  calendar  2005  from  407  billion  in  calendar  2001
 representing a compound annual growth rate  of 6  in addition the  report
 indicated there was an increase in  industry spending of 95 from  december

 the federal  deposit  insurance  corporation fdic  reported  there  were
 approximately 9000 commercial and savings banks in the united states as  of
 december 31 2005  consolidation within the banking  and  savings  services
 industry has resulted in a  2 compound annual decline in the population  of
 commercial and savings banks  from calendar years 2001  to 2005  even  with
 the decline in the population aggregate assets of these banks increased  at
 an annual  compound  rate  of  8  between  calendar  year  2001  and  2005
 comparing calendar  year  2005  to  2004  new  bank  and  savings  charters

 core banking and credit union clients and selling additional  complementary
 products and services to those banks  and credit unions that were using  our
 core solutions  we did not  generally offer our complementary products  and
 services to banks  or credit  unions that  were not  using one  of our  core
 processing solutions  with our acquisitions  in recent  years  we are  now
 marketing and selling selected complementary products and solutions  through
 our profitstars brand to  banks and credit unions  regardless of which  core
 processing solution the financial institutions are using  thus we now have
 essentially two categories of complementary products 1 those that we offer
 only to those banks  or credit unions  that use one  of our core  processing
 solutions  and  2  those  that  we  offer  to  any  financial  institution
 regardless of core provider

 these fees generally increase as our customers asset base increases and  as
 they increase  the level  of functionality  of  their system  by  purchasing
 additional complementary  products  software  support  fees  are  generally
 billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year  with
 proration for new contracts that start during the year at the time of final
 conversion  hardware support fees are  also paid in advance for the  entire
 contract  period  that  ranges  from  one  to  five  years  most  contracts

 million  of the  1556  million amount  of  the  backlog  for  outsourcing
 service at june 30 2006 approximately 1143 million is not expected to be

 comprehensiveness  of   the   applications  features   and   functionality

 inc and metavante  a subsidiary of  marshall and  isley corporation  in
 addition we  compete with  a number  of providers  that offer  one or  more
 specialized products or services  there has been significant  consolidation
 over the last decade among providers of information technology products  and
 services to financial institutions and  we believe this consolidation  will
 continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks

 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology  we have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks  most of our technology is
 not patented  instead we rely  on a combination of contractual rights  and
 copyrights trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology  we generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees  consultants  resellers  customers  and   potential
 customers  we restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further limit  the  disclosure and  use  of other  proprietary  information
 despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized  parties
 may attempt to copy or otherwise  obtain or use our products or  technology
 we  cannot   be   certain  that  the  steps  taken  by  us  in  this  regard
 will be adequate to prevent misappropriation  of  our  technology  or  that
 our  competitors  will  not  independently  develop  technologies  that  are
 substantially equivalent or superior to our technology

 government regulation

 the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation  our current and prospective customers which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as  communityregional  banks  and  credit
 unions operate  in  markets  that are  subject  to  substantial  regulatory
 oversight and supervision  we  must ensure our  products and services  work
 within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to  our
 customers including but not  limited to those  under the federal  truthin
 lending and  truthinsavings  rules  the  privacy  of  consumer  financial
 information regulations usury laws the  equal credit opportunity act  the
 fair housing  act  the  electronic funds  transfer  act  the  fair  credit
 reporting act the bank secrecy act  the usa patriot act the  grammleach
 bliley act  and the  community  reinvestment  act  the compliance  of  our
 products and  services  with these  requirements  depends on  a  variety  of
 factors including the particular  functionality the interactive design  and
 the classification  of  customers and  the  manner in  which  the  customer
 utilizes the  system  our customers  must  assess  and  determine  what  is
 required of them under these regulations and they contract with us to assist
 them through our products and services in meeting their  regulatory  needs
 it is not possible to predict the impact any of these regulations could have
 on our business in the future

 we are not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board
 of governors  of  the federal  reserve  system  the national  credit  union
 administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions  the services provided by our outlink data  centers

 requirements as those imposed on financial institutions  we are subject  to
 periodic  review  by  federal  financial  institution  examination   council

 item 1a  risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous factors and uncertainties  some of which  are beyond our  control
 the  following  is  a  description  of  some  of  the  important  risks  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future periods to differ from those expected or desired

 changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our
 products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability
 and  revenue  growth  at  commercial banks  and  credit unions  unfavorable
 economic conditions  negatively  affect the  spending  of banks  and  credit
 unions   including  spending  on  computer  software  and  hardware   such
 conditions  could   reduce   both   our   sales   to   new   customers   and
 upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers

 we  may  not  be  able  to  manage  growth  we  have grown  both internally
 and through acquisitions  our  expansion has  and  will continue  to  place
 significant  demands  on  our  administrative  operational  financial  and
 management personnel and systems  we may not be able to enhance and  expand
 our product lines  manage costs adapt  our infrastructure  and modify  our
 systems to accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology  we
 could  lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business  the
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes  these  factors and  new  product  introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services  if we are unable  to  develop
 or acquire new products and services as planned  or if we fail to sell  our
 new or enhanced products and services  we may incur unanticipated  expenses
 or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 security problems could  damage our  reputation and  business  we  rely  on
 standard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we
 license from  third  parties to  provide  the security  and  authentication
 necessary to effect secure transmission of data  computer networks and  the
 internet are vulnerable to unauthorized  access computer viruses and  other
 disruptive  problems  individual personal  computers  can  be  stolen  and
 customer data  tapes can  be lost  in shipment  under  state  and  proposed
 federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs
 to remediate security  breaches can  be  substantial  advances in  computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  security risks
 may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from
 purchasing our products  we will continue to expend significant capital and
 other resources protecting against the threat  of security breaches and  we
 may need  to  expend  resources alleviating  problems  caused  by  breaches
 eliminating computer  viruses and  addressing  other security  problems  may
 result in interruptions  delays or cessation  of service to  users any  of
 which could harm our business

 our growth may be  affected if we  are unable to  find or complete  suitable
 acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of
 acquisitions and  we plan  to continue  to acquire  appropriate  businesses
 products and services  this strategy depends on  our  ability to  identify
 negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions  substantial recent merger  and
 acquisition activity  in  our industry  has  affected the  availability  and
 pricing  of  such  acquisitions  if  we  are  unable  to  acquire  suitable
 acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

 acquisitions may be costly and difficult  to integrate  we have acquired  a
 number of businesses  in the  last few years  and will  continue to  explore
 acquisitions in the future  we  may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired companies  we may encounter  problems with the integration of  new
 businesses including financial control  and computer system  compatibility
 unanticipated  costs  unanticipated  quality  or  customer  problems   with
 acquired products or services differing regulatory  and industry standards
 diversion of managements  attention adverse effects  on existing  business
 relationships with  suppliers  and customers  loss  of key  employees  and
 significant amortization expenses  related to acquired  assets  to  finance
 future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or
 debt securities to the public  without additional acquisitions we may  not
 be able to grow and to  develop new products and  services as quickly as  we
 have in the  past to  meet the competition  if  we  fail  to integrate  our
 acquisitions our business  financial condition and  results of  operations
 could be materially and adversely affected  failed acquisitions could  also
 produce material  and unpredictable  impairment charges  as we  periodically
 review our acquired assets

 competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or
 require price  reductions  or other  concessions  to customers  which  could
 result in lower  margins and reduce  income  we  vigorously compete with  a
 variety of software vendors in all of  our major product lines  we  compete
 on the  basis of  product quality  reliability performance  ease of  use
 quality of support integration  with other products and  pricing  some  of
 our competitors  may have  advantages over  us due  to their  size  product
 lines greater  marketing  resources  or  exclusive  intellectual  property
 rights  if competitors  offer  more  favorable  pricing payment  or  other
 contractual terms  warranties or  functionality  or if  general  economic
 conditions decline such that customers are  less willing or able to pay  the
 cost of our products we may need  to lower prices or offer favorable  terms
 in order to successfully compete

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend on
 the contributions and abilities of our  senior management  our company  has
 grown significantly in recent years and our management remains  concentrated
 in a small  number of key  employees  if  we lose one  or more  of our  key
 employees we  could  suffer a  loss  of sales  and  delays in  new  product
 development and management resources would have  to be diverted from  other
 activities   to  compensate  for  this  loss  we  do  not  have  employment
 agreements with any of our executive officers

 consolidation of financial institutions will  continue to reduce the  number
 of our customers and  potential customers  our  primary market consists  of
 approximately 9000 commercial  and savings banks  and 9000 credit  unions
 the number of commercial  banks and credit unions  has decreased because  of
 mergers and acquisitions over  the last several decades  and is expected  to
 continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder the development of portions of our business  or
 impose constraints on  the way  we conduct  our  operations  the  financial
 services industry  is subject  to extensive  and complex  federal and  state
 regulation  as a supplier of  services to financial institutions  portions
 of our  operations are  examined by  the office  of the  comptroller of  the
 currency the  federal  reserve  board and  the  federal  deposit  insurance
 corporation  among  other  regulatory  agencies  these  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations  in
 addition existing  laws  regulations and  policies  could be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on our existing operations  or that limits our  future growth or  expansion
 our customers  are  also  regulated  entities  and  actions  by  regulatory
 authorities could  determine both  the decisions  they make  concerning  the
 purchase  of  data  processing  and  other  services  and  the  timing   and
 implementation of these decisions  concerns are growing with respect to the
 use  confidentiality  and  security   of  private  customer   information
 regulatory  agencies  congress  and  state  legislatures  are   considering
 numerous regulatory  and statutory  proposals to  protect the  interests  of
 consumers and to require  compliance with standards  and policies that  have
 not been defined

 the software we  provide to  our customers  is also  affected by  government
 regulation  we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software
 solutions  that  comply  with  applicable  federal  and  state  regulations
 substantial software research and development and other corporate  resources
 have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products  to
 this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory  environment  our
 failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines  or
 consumer liability  on  our  customers  for  which  we  may  bear  ultimate
 liability

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware are  declining  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from  remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease   computer  hardware  technology   is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to  lose
 customers  damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations
 could damage  our relationship  with customers  and may  cause us  to  incur
 substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged  equipment  our
 backup systems  and  procedures  may not  prevent  disruption  such  as  a
 prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services  in the event
 that an interruption of our network extends for more than several hours  we
 may experience  data loss  or a  reduction  in revenues  by reason  of  such
 interruption  in addition a significant interruption of service could have
 a negative impact on our reputation and could lead our present and potential
 customers to choose other service providers

 if our strategic  relationship with  ibm were  terminated it  could have  a
 negative impact on the  continuing success of our  business  we market  and
 sell ibm  hardware and  equipment to  our customers  under an  ibm  business
 partner agreement and  resell maintenance on  ibm hardware  products to  our
 customers  much  of  our  software  is  designed  to be compatible with the
 ibm  hardware that  is run  by a  majority of  our  customers  if ibm  were
 to  terminate  or  fundamentally  modify  our  strategic  relationship  our
 relationship with our customers and our revenues and earnings could  suffer
 we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign existing
 products or develop new products for new hardware platforms

 if others claim that we have  infringed their intellectual property  rights
 we could be  liable for significant  damages  we  have agreed to  indemnify
 many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe
 on  the  proprietary rights  of others  we  anticipate that  the number  of
 infringement claims will increase  as the number  of our software  solutions
 and services increases and  the functionality of  our products and  services
 expands  any such claims whether  with or  without merit  could be  time
 consuming result in  costly litigation  and may  not be  resolved on  terms
 favorable to us

 expansion of services to  nontraditional customers could  expose us to  new
 risks some  of our  recent acquisitions  include  business lines  that  are
 marketed outside our traditional  regulated and litigationaverse base  of
 financial institution customers  these  nonregulated customers may  entail
 greater operational credit and litigation risks  than we have faced  before
 and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

 increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may  decrease
 overall margins  we continue to experience a trend of a greater  proportion
 of our  products being  sold as  outsourcing services  rather than  inhouse
 licenses  we  realize lower  margins on  service revenues  than on  license
 revenues  thus  if  service revenue  increases as  a percentage  of  total
 revenue our gross margins  will be lower and  our operating results may  be
 impacted

 failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could  negatively
 affect  our  outsourcing business  our  contracts  with our  customers  for
 outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years
 because of the rapid growth of  our outsourcing business over the last  five
 years we will experience greater numbers  of these contracts coming up  for
 renewal over the next few years  renewal time presents our  customers  with
 the  opportunity  to  consider  other  providers  or  to  renegotiate  their
 contracts with us  if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates
 upon favorable  terms  our outsourcing  revenues  and profit  margins  will
 suffer

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
          results of operations

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected financial  data and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report

  overview

 background and overview

 we provide  integrated computer  systems for  inhouse and  outsourced  data
 processing  to  commercial   banks  credit  unions   and  other   financial
 institutions  we have  developed  and  acquired banking  and  credit  union
 application software  systems  that  we  market  together  with  compatible
 computer hardware to these  financial institutions  we  also perform  data
 conversion and software implementation services for our systems and  provide
 continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented  for
 our customers  who prefer  not to  make an  upfront capital  investment  in
 software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on
 an outsourced  basis through  our six  data centers  and 23  itemprocessing
 centers located throughout the united states

 a detailed discussion of the major  components of the results of  operations
 follows  all amounts are in  thousands and discussions compare fiscal  2006
 to fiscal 2005 and compare fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2004

 we derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue

    software licenses

    support and service fees which include implementation services and

    hardware sales which includes all nonsoftware remarketed products

 over the last five  fiscal years our revenues  have grown from 396657  in
 fiscal 2002 to 592205 in fiscal 2006  net  income has grown from  57065
 in fiscal 2002 to 89924 in fiscal 2006 this growth has resulted primarily
 from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing  us
 to develop  and  acquire new products  and  services for approximately 2300
 customers who utilize our core software systems as of june 30 2006

 since  the  start  of fiscal 2002  we  have completed 17 acquisitions  all
 of these  acquisitions  were  accounted  for  using  the  purchase method of
 accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results  of
 operations of  the  acquired  companies from  their  respective  acquisition
 dates

 license revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted  with us  by the  customer  we license  our  proprietary
 software products under standard  license agreements that typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  nonexclusive  nontransferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location

 support  and  services  fees  are  generated  from  implementation  services
 contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  atm and  debit
 card processing services  outsourcing  services  are performed through  our
 data and item centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and
 atm and debit card processing services  are derived from monthly usage  fees
 typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers

 cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue

 cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 implementation  efforts  ongoing  support   for  our  inhouse   customers
 operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced
 customers  atm  and  debit card processing services  and  direct operation
 costs

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our customers  cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of
 purchasing  the  equipment  from  the  manufacturers  and  delivery  to  our
 customers

 we have two business  segments bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services  the respective segments include all related  license
 support and  service and  hardware sales  along with  the related  cost  of
 sales


 results of operations

 license revenue  represents  the  delivery  and  acceptance  of  application
 software systems  contracted  by  us  with  the  customer  we  license  our
 proprietary  software  products  under  standard  license  agreements   that
 typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable  right
 to use  the  software  on a  single  computer  and for  a  single  financial
 institution location

 license revenue increased by 1640 compared to last fiscal year mainly  due
 to growth in delivery and acceptance of software systems within the  banking
 segment partially offset by  a decrease in the  credit union segment  which
 had experienced record revenues in fiscal 2005 yeartodate license revenue

 the company has  entered into remarketing  agreements with several  hardware
 manufacturers under which  we sell computer  hardware hardware  maintenance
 and related services to our customers  revenue related to hardware sales is
 recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers

 hardware revenue continued to decrease as in prior years due to the  overall
 rising  equipment  processing  power  and  decreasing equipment prices  the
 company experienced  growth in  revenues related  to ibm  iseries  machines
 which was offset  by a  decrease in  revenues related  to pseries  machines
 these changes are consistent with the  changes experienced with our  license
 revenues  in addition the  company discontinued offering certain  services
 related to uninterruptible power supply  equipment during fiscal 2005  which
 led to a decrease sales of that equipment during fiscal 2006

 cost of  license decreased  for the  fiscal year  due to  fewer third  party
 reseller agreement software vendor  costs  gross  profit margin on  license
 revenue increased because  a smaller percentage  of the  revenue growth  was
 attributable  to  these reseller agreements  cost of  support  and  service
 increased  for  the  year  primarily  due  to  additional  personnel   costs
 including  a  9  increase in headcount and costs related to the expansion
 of infrastructure  including  depreciation amortization  and  maintenance
 contracts as compared to last year  the gross profit margin  increased  to
 36 from 33 in support and service primarily due to efficiencies gained as
 recent acquisitions have  become more  fully integrated  and to  a shift  in
 sales mix toward services with slightly higher margins such as our atm  and
 debit card processing services  cost of hardware decreased for the year in
 line with the  decrease in  hardware sales primarily  due to  the types  of
 equipment  sold  with  varying  vendor  incentives  in  the  current  year
 incentives  and  rebates  received  from  vendors  fluctuate  quarterly  and
 annually due to changing  thresholds established by  the  vendors  hardware
 gross profit margin decreased due to the number of hardware shipments sales
 mix and vendor rebates received throughout the year

 in the prior quarters of  the current fiscal year  gross  profit margin  on
 license revenue increased  slightly due to  the associated  costs for  third
 party software marketed through  reseller agreements  cost of  support  and
 service increased for the year in line with the support and service revenue
 increase primarily due to additional personnel costs and costs relating  to
 the expanding  infrastructure  including  depreciation  amortization  and
 maintenance contracts as compared to the same periods last year  the gross
 profit margin remained at 33 in support and service for both fiscal  years
 primarily due  to  increased  headcount relating  to  support  and  service
 facility costs related to new acquisitions and depreciation expense of  new
 equipment  cost of  hardware decreased  for  the year  in  line  with  the
 decrease in hardware sales  primarily due to the  types of equipment  sold
 with varying vendor incentives in the current year  incentives and  rebates
 received from  vendors  fluctuate quarterly  and  annually due  to  changing
 thresholds  established  by  the  vendors   hardware  gross  profit  margin
 increased minimally due to the number  of hardware shipments sales mix  and

 increase  gross  profit  in this  business  segment decreased  slightly  in
 fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 mainly  due to the decrease in hardware  margin

 critical accounting policies

 we  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  united  states  us
 gaap  the  significant  accounting  policies  are  discussed  in  note  1
 to  the consolidated financial  statements  the preparation of consolidated
 financial statements  in  accordance with  us  gaap requires  us  to  make
 estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets
 liabilities revenue  and  expenses as  well  as disclosure  of  contingent
 assets and liabilities  we base our estimates and judgments upon historical
 experience  and  other   factors  believed  to   be  reasonable  under   the
 circumstances  changes in  estimates  or  assumptions  could  result  in  a
 material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements

 we have identified  several critical  accounting  estimates  an  accounting
 estimate is considered critical if both  a the nature of the estimates or
 assumptions is  material due  to the  levels  of subjectivity  and  judgment
 involved and b  the impact of  changes in the  estimates and  assumptions
 would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

 revenue recognition

 we recognize  revenue in  accordance with  the  provisions of  statement  of
 position sop 972 software revenue recognition as amended by sop 98
 9 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and
 clarified by staff accounting bulletin  sab 101 revenue recognition  in
 financial statements sab 104  revenue recognition and emerging  issues
 task  force  issue  no  0021  eitf  0021  accounting  for   revenue
 arrangements  with  multiple  deliverables   the  application   of   these
 pronouncements requires judgment including  whether a  software arrangement
 includes multiple  elements  whether  any elements  are  essential  to  the
 functionality of any other  elements and whether  vendorspecific objective
 evidence  vsoe  of  fair  value  exists  for those  elements  customers
 receive certain elements of our products over time  changes to the elements
 in a  software arrangement  or in  our ability  to identify  vsoe for  those
 elements could materially impact the amount  of earned and unearned  revenue
 reflected in the financial statements

 license fee revenue  for software license agreements  that  do not  require
 significant modification  or  customization  of the  software  the  company
 recognizes  software  license  revenue   when  persuasive  evidence  of   an
 arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is
 fixed and determinable and collection is  probable  the companys  software
 license agreements  generally  include  multiple products  and  services  or
 elements  none  of  these elements are  deemed to  be  essential  to  the
 functionality of the  other  elements  sop 972  as amended  by sop  989
 generally  requires  revenue  earned  on  software  arrangements   involving
 multiple elements to be allocated to  each element based on vendor  specific
 objective evidence vsoe  of fair value  fair value  is  determined  for
 license  fees based  upon the  price charged when  sold  separately  in the
 event that we  determine that vsoe  does not exist  for one or  more of  the
 delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the
 undelivered elements revenue is recognized  the residual method allowed  by
 sop 989  under  the  residual  method  a  residual  amount of  the  total
 arrangement fee is recognized  as revenue for  the delivered elements  after
 the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted

 support and service fee revenue  implementation services are generally  for
 installation training implementation and  configuration  these  services
 are not considered essential to the  functionality of the related  software
 vsoe  of  fair  value  is  established  by pricing  used when these services
 are sold separately  generally revenue  is  recognized  when  services  are
 completed  on certain larger  implementations revenue is recognized  based
 on milestones during the implementation  milestones are triggered by  tasks
 completed or based on direct labor hours

 maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period
 typically one year  vsoe  of  fair value  is determined  based on  contract
 renewal rates

 outsourced  data  processing  services  and  atm  debit  card  and   other
 transaction processing services  revenues are  recognized in  the month  the
 transactions were processed or the services were rendered

 hardware revenue  hardware  revenue  is  recognized  upon delivery  to  the
 customer when title and risk of loss are transferred  in most cases we do
 not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for third
 party suppliers to dropship  the products to our  customers on our  behalf
 for these transactions the  company follows the  guidance provided in  eitf
 9919 reporting revenue  gross as  a principal  versus net  as an  agent
 based upon  the  indicators  provided within  this  consensus  the  company
 records the revenue related to our  dropship transactions at gross and  the
 related costs are included in cost of hardware  the company also  remarkets
 maintenance contracts on  hardware to our  customers  hardware  maintenance
 revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period

 depreciation and amortization expense

 the calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and
 intangible assets  which  have been  examined  for their  useful  life  and
 determined that no impairment  exists  we believe  it is unlikely that  any
 significant changes  to the  useful lives  of  our tangible  and  intangible
 assets will  occur in  the near  term but  rapid changes  in technology  or
 changes in market  conditions could result  in revisions  to such  estimates
 that could materially  affect the  carrying value  of these  assets and  the
 companys future consolidated operating results  all long lived assets  are
 tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis

 capitalization of software development costs

 we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products
 and to develop or purchase internaluse software significant estimates  and
 assumptions include  determining  the  appropriate  period  over  which  to
 amortize  the  capitalized  costs  based  on  the  estimated  useful  lives
 estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related
 future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment
 for commercial software products  determining the appropriate  amortization
 period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the  products
 we consider various  factors to project  marketability and future  revenues
 including an assessment  of alternative solutions  or products current  and
 historical demand for  the product  and anticipated  changes in  technology
 that may make  the product  obsolete a  significant change  in an  estimate
 related to one or more software  products could result in a material  change
 to our results of operations

 estimates used to determine deferred income taxes

 we make certain estimates  and judgments in  determining income tax  expense
 for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the
 calculation  of  certain  tax  assets  and  liabilities  which  arise  from
 differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax  and
 financial statement  purposes  we also  must  determine the  likelihood  of
 recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation  allowances
 accordingly considerations  include the  period of  expiration of  the  tax
 asset planned use of  the tax asset and  historical and projected  taxable
 income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the  tax
 asset relates valuation allowances are  evaluated periodically and will  be
 subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes  in
 one or more of these factors

 assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill

 we account for  our acquisitions using  the purchase  method of  accounting
 this  method  requires  estimates  to  determine  the fair  values of assets
 and liabilities  acquired  including  judgments to  determine  any acquired
 intangible  assets  such  as   customerrelated  intangibles  as  well   as
 assessments of  the fair  value  of existing  assets  such  as  property and
 equipment liabilities  acquired can  include  balances for  litigation  and
 other  contingency  reserves  established  prior  to  or  at  the  time   of
 acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value  third
 party valuation firms  may be  used to assist  in the  appraisal of  certain
 assets  and liabilities but  even  those  determinations would be based  on
 significant estimates provided by us such as forecasted revenues or profits
 on contractrelated intangibles numerous  factors are typically  considered
 in the  purchase  accounting assessments  which  are conducted  by  company
 professionals from  legal finance  human resources  information  systems
 program  management  and  other  disciplines  changes  in  assumptions  and
 estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes  to
 the fair values resulting in an  offsetting change to the goodwill  balance
 associated with the business acquired

 as goodwill is not amortized goodwill  balances are regularly assessed  for
 potential impairment  such  assessments require an  analysis of future cash
 flow  projections as well as a  determination  of  an  appropriate  discount
 rate  to  calculate  present  values  cash  flow  projections  are based on
 managementapproved estimates  which involve  the input of numerous company
 professionals from finance operations  and program management key  factors
 used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and  other
 direct costs on existing  contracts estimates of  overhead costs and  other
 indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected  win
 rates significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase
 accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the
 consolidated financial statements

 industry background

 according to the automation in banking 2005 report united states  financial
 institutions  including  commercial  banks  thrifts  and  credit   unions
 increased spending on hardware software services and telecommunications to
 459 billion  in  calendar  2004  from  383  billion  in  calendar  2000
 representing a compound annual growth rate of 5  there was an increase  in
 industry spending of 8 from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004

 the federal  deposit  insurance  corporation fdic  reported  there  were
 approximately 9000 commercial and savings banks in the united states as  of
 december 31 2004  our bank systems and services segment which represented
 approximately  80 of  our  total revenues  in  fiscal  2005  is  primarily
 commercial banks with less than 300 billion in assets of which there were
 approximately 8900 at december 31 2004  consolidation within the  banking
 and savings services industry has resulted  in a 3 compound annual  decline
 in the population  of  commercial  banks  from calendar years  2000 to 2004
 even with the  decline in the  population aggregate assets  of these  banks
 increased at an annual  compound rate of 8  between calendar year 2000  and
 2004  comparing calendar year 2004 to 2003 new bank charters increased  8
 and mergers increased 17

 financial institutions in order to  succeed and to maintain strong customer
 relationships we believe these banks and credit unions must

 our products and services

 changing  technologies  business  practices  and  financial  products  have
 resulted in issues  of compatibility scalability  and increased  complexity
 for the hardware  and  software  used  in  many  financial institutions  we
 have  responded  to  these  issues by developing a fully integrated suite of
 products and services  consisting  of core software systems  hardware  and
 complementary products and services

 we provide our full range of products and services to financial institutions

 while it is  our goal to  provide the full  suite of  solutions a  financial
 institution may  require we  recognize the  reality that  a number  of  our
 clients will  wish to  deploy some  technology solutions  provided by  other
 companies  accordingly we are deploying enhanced integration  capabilities
 with third party solutions  this  is particularly important as we  continue
 to expand  our presence  in the  midtier banking  space defined  as  banks

 complementary products and services

 in years past  our strategy has  been focused on  two fronts acquiring  new
 core banking and credit union clients and selling additional  complementary
 products and services to those banks  and credit unions that were using  our
 core solutions  we did not  generally offer our complementary products  and
 services to banks  or credit  unions that  were not  using one  of our  core
 processing  solutions  with our acquisitions  in recent years  we are  now
 marketing and selling selected complementary products and solutions to banks
 and  credit  unions  regardless  of  which  core  processing  solutions  the
 financial institutions are using  thus in todays environment we now  have
 essentially two categories of complementary products 1 those that we offer
 only  to those banks or credit unions  that use one  of our core  processing
 solutions  and  2  those  that  we  offer  to  any  financial  institution
 regardless of core provider which are primarily those products and services
 we acquired in 2004 and 2005

 sales force  markets specific  complementary products  and services  to  our
 existing customers  we  also have a dedicated  sales force responsible  for
 new customers for our acquired businesses targeted outside our core customer

 territory  the sales support teams  write business proposals and  contracts
 and prepare responses  to requestforproposals regarding  our software  and
 hardware solutions  all  of our sales professionals  receive a base  salary
 and performancebased commission compensation

 our marketing efforts consist of sponsorship and attendance at trade  shows
 email newsletters print media advertisement placements telemarketing and
 national and regional  marketing campaigns  we  also  conduct  a number  of
 national user group  meetings each year  which enable us  to keep in  close
 contact with  our customers  and demonstrate  new products  and services  to
 them

 we continue  to sell  and support  selected products  and solutions  in  the
 caribbean and  now have  installations in  europe and  south america  as  a
 result of our recent acquisitions  our international sales  have  accounted
 for less than 1 of our total revenues in each of the three years ended june
 30 2005 2004 and 2003

 backlog

 our backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services prior  to
 delivery and  the remaining  portion of  outsourcing contracts  which  are
 typically for fiveyear  periods and approximately  represents the  minimum
 guaranteed payments over the remainder of the contract period  our  backlog
 at june 30 2005  was 640 million for  inhouse products and services  and
 1351 million  for outsourcing  services with  a total  backlog of  1991
 million  of  the  1351  million amount  of  the backlog  for  outsourcing
 service at june 30 2005 approximately 980 million is not expected to  be
 realized in our current fiscal year due  to the longterm nature of many  of
 our outsourcing  service contracts   backlog  at june  30 2004  was  672
 million  for  inhouse  products  and   services  and  1241  million   for
 outsourcing services with a total backlog of 1913 million  our  inhouse
 backlog is subject to seasonal variations  and can fluctuate quarterly  our
 outsourcing  backlog  continues   to  experience  solid   growth  with   new
 contracting activity  and  as we  recognize  revenue throughout  the  coming
 fiscal year the backlog is expected  to remain constant due to the  revenue
 surpassing the new contracting activity

 competition

 the  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions is competitive and fragmented  and we expect continued  strong
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets  some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources
 the  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications features and  functionality
 flexibility and  ease of  use customer  support references  from  existing
 customers and price  we compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing  products  and  services  to  financial  institutions  including
 fidelity national financial inc fiserv inc and metavante in  addition
 we compete with  a number of  providers that offer  one or more  specialized
 products  or  services  there  has  been  significant  consolidation  among
 providers of  information  technology  products and  services  to  financial
 institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks

 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology  we have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks  most of our technology is
 not  patented  instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights  and
 copyrights trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology  we generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees  consultants  resellers  customers  and   potential
 customers  we restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further limit  the disclosure  and use  of  other  proprietary  information
 despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized  parties
 may attempt to copy  or otherwise obtain  or use our products or technology
 we  cannot  be  certain  that  the  steps taken  by us  in this  regard will
 be  adequate   to  prevent  misappropriation  of  our  technology  or  that
 our  competitors  will  not  independently  develop  technologies  that  are
 substantially equivalent or superior to our technology

 government regulation

 the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation  our current and prospective customers which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as  communityregional  banks  and  credit
 unions operate  in  markets  that are  subject  to  substantial  regulatory
 oversight and supervision  we  must ensure our  products and services  work
 within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to  our
 customers including but not  limited to those  under the federal  truthin
 lending and  truthinsavings  rules  the  privacy  of  consumer  financial
 information regulations usury laws the  equal credit opportunity act  the
 fair housing  act  the  electronic funds  transfer  act  the  fair  credit
 reporting act the bank secrecy act  the usa patriot act the  grammleach
 bliley act  and the  community reinvestment  act   the compliance  of  our
 products and  services  with these  requirements  depends on  a  variety  of
 factors including the particular  functionality the interactive design  and
 the classification of  customers  our customers  must assess and  determine
 what is required of them under  these regulations and they contract with  us
 to ensure that our products and services conform to their  regulatory  needs
 it is not possible to predict the impact any of these regulations could have
 on our business in the future

 we are not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board
 of governors  of  the federal  reserve  system the  national  credit  union
 administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions  the services provided by our outlink data  centers

 services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities

 identified in such reviews

                                risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous  factors and uncertainties  some of  which are beyond our control
 the following is  a description of  some of the  important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired

 changes within the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for
 our  products  in the current  environment of low  interest rates  revenue
 growth at many commercial banks and credit unions has stagnated  many banks
 and credit unions have been slow to resume their capital spending including
 spending on computer software and hardware affecting both our sales to  new
 customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers

 we  may  not  be  able  to  manage  growth   we have grown  both internally
 and through acquisitions  our  expansion has  and  will  continue  to place
 significant  demands  on  our  administrative  operational  financial  and
 management personnel and systems  we cannot assure you that we will be able
 to  enhance  and  expand  our  product   lines  manage  costs  adapt   our
 infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and  services  to  changes  in technology
 we  could  lose existing customers  and  be unable to  attract new business
 the markets  for  our  software  and  hardware  products  and  services  are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes  these  factors  and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on  our ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire  new products and services  if we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services we may incur
 unanticipated expenses lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 our growth may be  affected if we  are unable to  find or complete  suitable
 acquisitions  we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of
 acquisitions and  we plan  to continue  to acquire  appropriate  businesses
 products and services  this  strategy depends on  our ability to  identify
 negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions  substantial recent merger  and
 acquisition activity  in  our industry  has  affected the  availability  and
 pricing  of  such  acquisitions  if  we  are  unable  to  acquire  suitable
 acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth

 acquisitions may be costly and difficult  to integrate  we have acquired  a
 number of  businesses  in  the  last  year  and  will  continue  to  explore
 acquisitions  in the future  we may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired  companies  we  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services  diversion  of  managements
 attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets  without additional acquisitions
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to  meet  competitive challenges  if  our
 integration strategies fail  our  business financial condition and results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 if our strategic  relationship with  ibm were  terminated it  could have  a
 negative  impact  on  the  continuing  success  of  our  business  we  have
 developed a strategic relationship with ibm  as part of this  collaborative
 relationship we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  ibm  business partner  agreement  and resell  maintenance  on  ibm
 hardware products  to  our  customers  much  of  our  software  is designed
 to  be  compatible  with  the  ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our
 customers  if ibm were to  terminate or fundamentally modify our  strategic
 relationship our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings could  suffer   we could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers

 competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services  we expect  that competition in the markets we  serve
 will  remain  vigorous   we  compete  on  the  basis  of  product  quality
 reliability performance ease of use quality of support integration  with
 other products and pricing  we cannot  guarantee that  we  will be able  to
 compete  successfully  with  our  existing  competitors  or  with  companies
 entering our markets in the future  certain of our competitors have  strong
 financial marketing  and  technological resources  and  in some  cases  a
 larger customer base than we do  they may be able to adapt more quickly  to
 new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion
 and sale of their products and services

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management  our  company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated  in a small number of key employees  if  we
 lose one or more of our key employees  we could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss  we do not  have
 employment agreements with any of our  executive officers  we do  however
 have a management succession plan in place

 consolidation of financial institutions will  continue to reduce the  number
 of our customers and  potential customers  our  primary market consists  of
 approximately 9000 commercial  banks includes savings  loans  and  9200
 credit unions  the  number  of  commercial  banks  and  credit  unions  has
 decreased because of mergers and acquisitions over the last several  decades
 and  is  expected  to  continue  to  decrease  as more consolidation occurs
 which  will  reduce our number  of  potential  customers  because  of  this
 consolidation some of our existing customers could terminate or refuse  to
 renew their  contracts  with us  and  potential customers  could  break  off
 negotiations with us

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations   the
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation  as a supplier of services to financial institutions some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the office  of the  comptroller of  the
 currency the  federal  reserve  board and  the  federal  deposit  insurance
 corporation among  other  regulatory  agencies   these  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations  in
 addition existing  laws  regulations and  policies  could be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on  our  existing operations or that  limits our future growth or expansion
 our customers  are  also  regulated  entities  and  actions  by  regulatory
 authorities could  determine both  the decisions  they make  concerning  the
 purchase  of  data  processing  and  other  services  and  the  timing   and
 implementation of these decisions  the provision of financial services over
 the internet has raised concerns with  respect to the use  confidentiality
 and security of private customer information  regulatory agencies congress
 and state  legislatures are  considering numerous  regulatory and  statutory
 proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance by
 the industry with standards and policies that have not been defined

 network or  internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business  we rely on standard  network and internet security systems  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data   computer
 networks and the  internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems  in  addition advances in  computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers  security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products  we may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches   eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions delays or cessation of service  to users any of which  could
 harm our business

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease   computer  hardware  technology   is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities could cause us to
 lose customers  damage  or  destruction  that interrupts  our  provision of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment  although we  have installed backup systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services  in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption  in addition a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us

 if others claim that we have  infringed their intellectual property  rights
 we could be liable for significant damages   we do not believe that any  of
 our products or services infringe the  proprietary rights of third  parties
 we cannot be sure however that  others will not make infringement  claims
 and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those  claims
 we  anticipate that the number of  infringement claims will increase as  the
 number of software solutions and services increases and the functionality of
 our products and  services expands  any of  those claims  whether with  or
 without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and  may
 not be resolved on terms favorable to us

 expansion of services to  nontraditional customers could  expose us to  new
 risks some  of our  recent acquisitions  include  business lines  that  are
 marketed outside our traditional  regulated and litigationaverse base  of
 financial institution customers  these  nonregulated customers may  entail
 greater operational credit and litigation risks  than we have faced  before
 and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

 competitive pressures in  our industry  or general  economic conditions  may
 require that  we  reduce  our  prices or  offer  other  favorable  terms  to
 customers on our products and services  which could result in lower  margins
 and reduce net income  we compete with a variety of software vendors in all
 of our major  product lines  some of  our competitors may  have  advantages
 over us due to  their size product lines  greater marketing resources  or
 exclusive intellectual property rights  if competitors offer more favorable
 pricing payment or other  contractual terms warranties or  functionality
 or if  general economic  conditions decline  such  that customers  are  less
 willing or able to pay the cost of our products we may need to lower prices
 or offer other favorable terms in order to successfully compete

 the accounting treatment for employee stock options has changed which  will
 affect our earnings and cause us  to reconsider our business practices   we
 previously accounted for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no
 25 and recognized no compensation expense  for employee stock options  with
 the recent  adoption  of statement  of  financial accounting  standards  no
 123r we will be required in fy2006 to recognize compensation  expense for
 granted stock options based upon a calculation of their fair values at  date
 of grant  we have decided to reduce the number of stock options granted  to
 employees and to rely instead on  alternative forms of equity  compensation
 such as grants of restricted stock  this could affect our ability to retain
 existing employees and attract qualified candidates and also could increase
 the cash compensation we would have to pay them

 increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may  decrease
 overall margins  we continue to experience a trend of a greater  proportion
 of our  products being  sold as  outsourcing services  rather than  inhouse
 licenses  we  realize lower  margins on  service revenues  than on  license
 revenues  thus  if  service revenue  increases as  a percentage  of  total
 revenue our gross margins  will be lower and  our operating results may  be
 impacted

 failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could  negatively
 impact our  outsourcing business  our  contracts  with  our  customers  for
 outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of 35 years
 because  of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last  five
 years we will experience greater numbers  of these contracts coming up  for
 renewal over  the next few years  renewal time presents our customers  with
 the  opportunity  to  consider  other  providers  or  to  renegotiate  their
 contracts with us  if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates
 upon favorable terms  our revenues from  outsourcing and associated  profit
 margins could be negatively impacted

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
           results of operations

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected financial  data and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report

 overview

 background and overview

 a detailed discussion of the major  components of the results of  operations
 follows  all amounts are in  thousands and discussions compare fiscal  2005
 to fiscal 2004 along with fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003

 we derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue

    software licenses

    support and service fees which include implementation services and

    hardware sales which includes all nonsoftware remarketed products

 over the last five  fiscal years our revenues  have grown from 366903  in
 fiscal 2001 to 535863 in fiscal  2005  income from continuing  operations
 has grown from  55631  in  fiscal 2001 to 75501  in  fiscal  2005  this
 growth has  resulted  primarily  from  internal  expansion  supplemented  by
 strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop and acquire new products  and
 services for approximately  2300 customers  who utilize  our core  software
 systems as of june 30 2005

 since the start of fiscal 2001 we  have completed  16 acquisitions  all of
 these  acquisitions  were  accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method   of
 accounting and our consolidated financial statements include  the results of
 operations of  the  acquired  companies from  their  respective  acquisition
 dates

 license revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted  with us  by the  customer  we license  our  proprietary
 software products under standard  license agreements that typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  nonexclusive  nontransferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location

 support  and  services  fees  are  generated  from  implementation  services
 contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  atm and  debit
 card processing services  outsourcing  services  are performed through  our
 data and item centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and
 atm and debit card processing services  are derived from monthly usage  fees
 typically under fiveyear service contracts with our customers

 cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue

 cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 implementation  efforts  ongoing  support   for  our  inhouse   customers
 operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced
 customers atm  and debit  card processing  services and  direct  operation
 costs

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our customers  cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of
 purchasing  the  equipment  from  the  manufacturers  and  delivery  to  our
 customers

 we have two business  segments bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services  the respective segments include all related  license
 support  and  service and hardware sales  along with  the related  cost  of

 the increase in total cost of  sales is primarily due  to a 12 increase  in
 employee related  expenses for  increased headcount  and a  24 increase  in
 depreciation and amortization expense  included in the  cost of support  and
 service  this is due mainly to our efforts to continue improving  operating
 efficiencies by investing and upgrading  technology equipment  both  fiscal
 years cost  of  support and  service  remained  constant at  44  of  total
 revenue  cost of license increased mainly due to obligations to third party
 vendors for  the  software  we  resell  the decrease  in cost  of  hardware
 correlates to the decrease in hardware revenue

 gross margin  increased  from 38  to  40 in  fiscal  2004 due  to  overall
 increase in revenue while exercising cost control  gross margin on  license
 revenue remained consistent at 92 for both fiscal years  the gross  profit
 improvement is  due  to  a  significant increase  in  the  delivery  of  the
 companys  core  and  complementary  software  licenses  for  fiscal  2004
 delivery of third party license revenue and cost remained flat when compared
 with fiscal 2003  the increase in  gross margin for support and service  is
 primarily due  to  increased volumes  increased  number of  customers  and
 continued  leveraging  of  resources  of  employees  and  equipment  in  our
 outsourcing and atmdebit card processing services

 hardware gross margin for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 remained even at  28

 we devote significant effort  and  expense to develop new software  service
 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings
 typically  we  upgrade   all  of  our   core  and  complementary   software
 applications annually  we believe our research and development efforts  are
 highly efficient because  of the extensive  experience of  our research  and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer
 driven

 the increase in research and  development expense is primarily  attributable
 to  a  45 increase  in employee  related expenses  the  increase  includes
 standard salary  increases  along  with  additional employee  headcount  for
 ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in
 both segments of our business

 industry background

 according to the automation in banking 2004 report united states  financial
 institutions  including  commercial  banks  thrifts  and  credit   unions
 increased spending on hardware software services and telecommunications to
 424 billion  in  calendar  2003  from  366  billion  in  calendar  1999
 representing a compound annual growth rate of 4  the increase of  industry
 spending was 2 from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003

 in an article in june 2004  the silicon valley biz ink financial  services
 news idc of  silicon valley  a premier  advisory firm  in the  information
 technology and telecommunications  industries conducted a  survey of  banks
 regarding the role of information technology and future strategic priorities
 within the industry  the top bank survey responses were meeting  regulatory
 requirements managing  customer  relationships  managing  risks  reducing
 costs and attracting new customers

 the federal  deposit  insurance  corporation fdic  reported  there  were
 approximately 9200 commercial and savings banks in the united states as  of
 december 31 2003  our primary  market segment bank systems and  services
 which represented approximately 82 of our total revenues in fiscal 2004 is
 commercial banks with less than 300 billion in assets of which there were
 approximately 9140 at december 31 2003  consolidation within the  banking
 and savings services industry has resulted  in a 3 compound annual  decline
 in  the population  of  commercial banks from calendar  years 1999 and 2003
 even with the  decline in  the population there  was a  7 compound  annual
 increase  in their  aggregate  assets between  calendar year 1999  and 2003
 comparing years  2003  and 2002  new  bank charters  increased  27  while
 mergers decreased 22

 united states  the  national  credit union  association reported there were
 9400 credit unions  in the united  states as  of  december 31  2003  this
 segment represented approximately 18 of our total revenues  in fiscal 2004
 these  are  primarily  cooperative  notforprofit  financial  institutions
 organized to promote savings and provide credit to their members   although
 the number of these credit unions has declined at a 3 compound annual  rate
 between calendar year 1999 and 2003  their aggregate assets have  increased
 at a compound annual  growth rate of  9 to 6102  billion at december  31
 2003

 according  to callahan and associates 2004 credit union technology  survey
 credit unions  participating  in  the  survey  are  looking  for  technology
 enhancements in customer relationship  management to expand member  services
 and generate product usage enhance credit  union websites and home  banking
 platforms and upgrade atms for imaging  and check  21 capability  according
 to the respondents 72 indicated  their technologyspending budget for  the
 upcoming year included security upgrades dealing with the internet

 we believe that  commercial and  regional banks  and credit  unions play  an
 important role  with  the geographic  and  demographic communities  and  the
 customers they serve  typically customers  and members of these  financial
 institutions rely on them because of their ability to provide  personalized
 relationshipbased  service  and  their  focus  on  retail  commercial  and
 business needs  we  believe these core strengths  will allow our  financial
 institution customers to effectively compete with other banks credit unions
 and alternative financial institutions  in order to succeed and to maintain
 strong customer relationships we believe these banks and credit unions must
 continue to

          focus on excellence in delivery to customers and members of  their
           primary products and service offerings

          sell more  products and  services  to existing  customers  through
           utilization of customer relationship management crm products

          implement advanced  technologies and  services such  as  internet
           banking services imaging and platform automation

          use advanced  technologies  in backoffice  processes  to  improve
           operating efficiency and control costs  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers and

          integrate products  and services  into their  core  complementary
           service offerings and data  processing infrastructure to  provide
           competitive products and services to their customers and members

          manage risks by implementing  technology that monitors and  tracks
           transactions for fraud and criminal behavior

 according to automation in banking 2004 in calendar 2003 approximately  55
 of all  commercial banks  and 65  of all  credit unions  utilized  inhouse
 hardware and software systems to perform all of their core systems and  data
 processing functions   offsite  data  processing centers  provided  system
 services on an outsourced basis for 45 of  all banks and 31 of all  credit
 unions  we have expanded our  outsourcing services and capacity to  include
 all of our core solution products

 internet banking bill  payment and  other services  for individuals  plus
 cash management  automated  clearing  house ach  management  and  other
 services for the commercial customers of financial institutions continue  to
 grow rapidly within the industry

 passage of  the  check  truncation  act  check  21  will  impact  industry
 practices with respect to clearing checks  under the new legislation a new
 electronic image  instrument  will  now be  recognized  and  known  as  the
 substitute check or image replacement document  ird  this will  pave
 the way for widespread adoption of  clearing electronic images of checks  as
 opposed to the current practice of physically sending a check to the draw on
 bank for payment

           the information  technology products  and services  we provide  to
           those customers that do not utilize our full range of products and
           services  in  this way  we are  able to  increase revenues  from
           current customers  with  minimal additional  sales  and  marketing
           expenses

          expand  our  customer  base    we  seek  to  establish  longterm

           growth and success  our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees a  strategy we  believe has  resulted in  low  employee
           turnover  in addition we selectively use employee stock  options
           to serve as a strong incentive and retention tool

 our customers contract  with  us  for  installation  and  training  services
 in  connection  with  their  purchase  of  inhouse  systems  the  complete
 installation process of a core  system typically includes planning  design
 data conversion hardware setup and testing   at the culmination of  this
 installation  process  one  of  our  installation  teams  travels  to   our
 customers facilities  to ensure  the smooth  transfer of  data to  the  new
 system  separate charges for installation fees are billed to our  customers
 on  either  a  fixed  fee  or  hourly  charge model depending on the system
 with full passthrough  to  our customers  of  travel  and  other  expenses

 outsourcing  customers  and   are  billed   separately  at   the  time   of

 our customers  require  and we  provide  extensive training  services  and
 programs related to our products and services  training is provided in  our

 proficiency and productivity and  to make full use  of the functionality  of
 our systems  generally training services are paid for on an hourly  basis

 by our customers in a flexible fashion and the related revenue is recognized

 at a customer site we provide  ongoing software support services to  assist

 are  contracted  for  on  an  annual  basis  and  are  typically  priced  at
 approximately  18  to 20 of the  particular software products license fee

 increase the level of functionality of their system by purchasing additional

 30 and are paid in advance for  the entire fiscal year with proration  for
 new contracts  that start during the year  at the time  of final conversion

 us  of the  new products  and  functionalities  they  desire  research  and

 them

 we have 18  installations in the  caribbean  our  international sales  have
 accounted for less than 1 of our total revenues in each of the three  years
 ended june 30 2004 2003 and 2002

 backlog

 our backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services prior  to
 delivery and  the remaining  portion of  outsourcing contracts  which  are
 typically for  fiveyear  periods  and  represents  the  minimum  guaranteed
 payments over the remainder of the contract period  our backlog at june 30
 2004 was 672 million for inhouse products and services and 1241 million
 for outsourcing services with  a total backlog of  1913 million  of  the
 1241 million amount  of the backlog  for outsourcing service  at june  30
 2004 approximately 905  million is  not expected  to be  realized in  our
 current fiscal year due to the  longterm nature of many of our  outsourcing
 service contracts  backlog at june 30 2003 was 694 million for  inhouse
 products and services and  1137 million for  outsourcing services with  a
 total  backlog  of  1831 million  our  backlog  is  subject  to  seasonal
 variations and can  fluctuate quarterly  due to  various factors  including
 slower contract processing rates during the summer months

 competition

 the  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions  is  competitive  and  fragmented  and  we  expect   continued
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets  some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources
 the  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications features and  functionality
 flexibility and  ease of  use customer  support references  from  existing
 customers and price  we compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing  products  and  services  to  financial  institutions  including
 fidelity  national  financial  inc  fiserv  inc  intercept  inc   and
 metavante  in addition  we compete with a  number of providers that  offer
 one or more specialized  products or services   there has been  significant
 consolidation  among  providers  of  information  technology  products   and
 services to financial institutions and  we believe this consolidation  will
 continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks

 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology  we have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks  most of our technology is
 not  patented  instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights  and
 copyrights trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology  we generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees  consultants  resellers  customers  and   potential
 customers  we restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further  limit  the disclosure  and use  of other  proprietary  information
 despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized  parties
 may  attempt to copy  or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology
 we cannot be sure the steps taken by us  in this regard will be adequate  to
 prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will  not
 independently develop  technologies  that are  substantially  equivalent  or
 superior to our technology

 government regulation

 the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation  our current and prospective customers which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as commercial  banks  and  credit  unions
 operate in markets that are subject to substantial regulatory oversight  and
 supervision   we must  ensure our  products and  services work  within  the
 extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our  customers
 including those  under  the federal  truthinlending  and  truthinsavings
 rules usury laws the equal credit  opportunity act the fair housing  act
 the electronic funds transfer act the  fair credit reporting act the  bank
 secrecy act  the  usa patriot  act  the grammleachbliley  act  and  the
 community reinvestment act  the  compliance  of our  products and  services
 with these  requirements  depends on  a  variety of  factors  including  the
 particular functionality the interactive  design and the classification  of
 customers  our customers must assess and determine what is required of them
 under these  regulations  and they  contract  with  us to  ensure  that  our
 products and services conform to their regulatory needs  it is not possible
 to predict the impact any of these regulations could have on our business in
 the future

 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 implemented a variety of regulations that are
 intended to restore the  public faith in the  financial information that  is
 publicized by corporate entities  for our fiscal year ending june 2005  we
 will be impacted by these rules through  assessing and testing our  internal
 control over financial reporting

 we are not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board
 of governors  of  the federal  reserve  system the  national  credit  union
 administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions  the services provided by our outlink data  centers
 are subject to examination by the federal financial institution  examination
 council regulators under the bank service  company act  on occasion  these
 services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities

 we provide outsourced  data and item  processing through our  geographically
 dispersed outlink data  centers electronic  transaction processing  through
 passport atm and transaction processing solutions internet banking  through
 netteller online  banking  and  bank  business  recovery  services  through

 institutions  and  our  operations  are  governed  by  the  same  regulatory
 requirements as those imposed on financial  institutions  as to these  data
 processing services we are subject to periodic review by federal depository
 institution regulators who  have broad supervisory  authority to remedy  any
 shortcomings identified in such reviews

 employees

 as of june 30 2004 and 2003  we  had 2533 and  2257 full time  employees
 respectively  our employees  are not  covered  by  a collective  bargaining
 agreement and there have been no laborrelated work stoppages  we  consider

                                 risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous  factors and uncertainties  some of  which are beyond our control
 the following is  a description of  some of the  important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired

 changes within the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for
 our products  in the current environment of low interest rates the  profit
 margins of commercial banks and credit unions have narrowed  as the economy
 has  stumbled  loan demand has slackened  and loan defaults have increased
 as a  result many  banks and  credit unions  have slowed  or stopped  their
 capital spending  including spending  on  computer software  and  hardware
 affecting both  sales to  new  customers and  upgradecomplimentary  product
 sales to existing customers

 we may not  be able to  manage growth   we have grown  both internally  and
 through  acquisitions   our  expansion  has  and  will  continue  to  place
 significant  demands  on  our  administrative  operational  financial  and
 management personnel and systems  we cannot assure you that we will be able
 to  enhance  and  expand  our  product   lines  manage  costs  adapt   our
 infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology  we
 could lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business   the
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes   these  factors and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services   if we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services we may incur
 unanticipated expenses lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 acquisitions may be  costly and difficult  to integrate   we have  acquired
 several  businesses  and   will  continue  to   explore  possible   business
 combinations in the future   we may  not  be able to successfully integrate
 acquired  companies  we  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services  diversion  of  managements
 attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets  without additional acquisitions
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to meet  competitive challenges   if  our
 integration strategies fail our  business financial condition and  results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 if  our  strategic  relationship  with  ibm were  terminated it  could have
 a negative impact  on  the  continuing  success of  our  business  we  have
 developed a strategic relationship with ibm  as part of this  collaborative
 relationship we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  ibm  business partner  agreement  and resell  maintenance  on  ibm
 hardware products to our customers  much of our software is designed to  be
 compatible  with  the  ibm  hardware  that  is  run  by  a  majority of  our
 customers  if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally  modify  our strategic
 relationship our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings would  suffer   we could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers

 competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services  we expect  competition in the markets we serve  will
 remain vigorous  we compete on  the basis of product quality  reliability
 performance  ease  of  use  quality  of  support  and pricing  we  cannot
 guarantee that we  will be able  to compete successfully  with our  existing
 competitors or with companies entering our  markets in the future   certain
 of our  competitors  have  strong  financial  marketing  and  technological
 resources and in some cases a larger customer  base than we do  they  may
 be able to adapt more quickly to  new or emerging technologies or to  devote
 greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management  our  company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated in a small  number of key employees  if  we
 lose one or more of our key employees we  could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss  we do not  have
 employment agreements  with  any  of our  executive  officers  however  we
 currently have a management succession plan in place

 consolidation of  financial  institutions could  reduce  the number  of  our
 customers   and  potential  customers   our  primary  market  consists   of
 approximately 9140 commercial banks includes savings   loans  and  9400
 credit  unions  the number  of  commercial  banks  and  credit  unions  has
 decreased because of mergers  and acquisitions over the  last decade and  is
 expected to continue to  decrease as more  consolidation occurs which  will
 reduce our number of  potential customers   because of this  consolidation
 some of our  existing customers could  terminate or refuse  to renew  their
 contracts with us and potential customers could break off negotiations  with
 us

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations   the
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation  as a supplier of services to financial institutions some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the office  of the  comptroller of  the
 currency the  federal  reserve  board and  the  federal  deposit  insurance
 corporation among  other  regulatory  agencies   these  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations  in
 addition existing  laws  regulations and  policies  could be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on  our  existing operations or that  limits our future growth or expansion
 our customers  are also  regulated entities  and the  form and  content  of
 actions by regulatory  authorities could determine  both the decisions  they
 make concerning the purchase of data  processing and other services and  the
 timing and implementation of these decisions  the development of  financial
 services over the  internet has  raised concerns  with respect  to the  use
 confidentiality  and security of  private customer information  regulatory
 agencies  congress  and   state  legislatures   are  considering   numerous
 regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and
 to require compliance by the industry with standards and policies that  have
 not been defined

 network or  internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business  we rely on standard  network and internet security systems  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication  necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data  computer
 networks and the  internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems  in  addition advances  in computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers  security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products  we may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches   eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions delays or cessation of service  to users any of which  could
 harm our business

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may   decrease   computer  hardware  technology  is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities could cause us to
 lose customers  damage  or destruction  that interrupts  our  provision  of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment  although we  have installed backup systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services  in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption  in addition a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us

 if others claim that we have  infringed their intellectual property  rights
 we could be liable for significant damages   we do not believe that any  of
 our products or services infringe the  proprietary rights of third  parties
 we cannot be sure however that  others will not make infringement  claims
 and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those  claims
 we  anticipate that the number of  infringement claims will increase as  the
 number of software solutions and services increases and the functionality of
 our products and  services expands  any of  those claims  whether with  or
 without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and  may
 not be resolved on terms favorable to us

 expansion of services to  nontraditional customers could  expose us to  new
 risks some  of our  recent acquisitions  include  business lines  that  are
 marketed outside our traditional  regulated and litigationaverse base  of
 financial institution customers  these  nonregulated customers may  entail
 greater operational credit and litigation risks  than we have faced  before
 and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs

 competitive pressures in  our industry  or general  economic conditions  may
 require that  we  reduce  our  prices or  offer  other  favorable  terms  to
 customers on our products and services  which could result in lower  margins
 and reduce net income  we compete with a variety of software vendors in all
 of our major  product lines   some of our  competitors may have  advantages
 over us due to  their size product lines  greater marketing resources  or
 exclusive intellectual property rights  if competitors offer more favorable
 pricing payment or other  contractual terms warranties or  functionality
 or if  general economic  conditions decline  such  that customers  are  less
 willing or able to pay the cost of our products we may need to lower prices
 or offer other favorable terms in order to successfully compete

 if requirements  relating to  the accounting  treatment for  employee  stock
 options are changed we  may be forced to  change our business  practices or
 our earnings may  be affected   we currently  account for  the issuance  of
 stock options under  apb opinion  no 25  accounting for  stock  issued to
 employees  certain  proposals related to  accounting for the  grant of  an
 employee stock option  as an expense  are currently  under consideration  by
 accounting standards organizations  and governmental authorities   if  such
 proposals are  adopted our  earnings will  be negatively  impacted   as  a
 result we  may decide  to reduce  the number  of stock  options granted  to
 employees or to  grant options to  fewer employees   this could affect  our
 ability to retain existing employees  and attract qualified candidates  and
 also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay them

 increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues may  decrease
 overall margins  we continue to experience a trend of a greater  proportion
 of our  products being  sold as  outsourcing services  rather than  inhouse
 licenses  we  realize lower  margins on  service revenues  than on  license
 revenues   thus if  service revenue  increases as  a percentage  of  total
 revenue our gross margins would be  lower and our operating results may  be
 impacted

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
           results of operations

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected financial  data and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report

 overview

 we provide  integrated computer  systems for  inhouse and  outsourced  data
 processing  to  commercial   banks  credit  unions   and  other   financial
 institutions  we  have  developed and  acquired  banking and  credit  union
 application software  systems  that  we  market  together  with  compatible
 computer hardware to these  financial institutions   we also perform  data
 conversion and software installation for  the implementation of our  systems
 and provide  continuing  customer support  services  after the  systems  are
 installed  for  our customers who  prefer not to  make an upfront  capital
 investment in software and hardware we  provide our full range of  products
 and services on an  outsourced basis through our  seven data centers and  17
 itemprocessing centers located throughout the united states

 we derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue

    sales of software licenses

    support and service fees which include installation services and

    hardware sales

 over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 2398 million
 in fiscal 2000  to 4674 million  in fiscal 2004   income from  continuing
 operations has grown from 344 million  in fiscal 2000 to 623 million  in
 fiscal 2004  this  growth has  resulted primarily  from internal  expansion
 supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing  us to develop and  acquire
 new products and  services and expand  the number of  customers who use  our
 core software systems to approximately 2340 as of june 30 2004

 since the start of our fiscal year 2000 we have completed twelve  accretive
 acquisitions  eleven  of these acquisitions  were accounted  for using  the
 purchase method  of accounting  and  our consolidated  financial  statements
 include the  results of  operations of  the  acquired companies  from  their
 respective acquisition dates  the  remaining acquisition was accounted  for
 using the poolingofinterests method

 license revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted  with us  by the  customer  we license  our  proprietary
 software products under standard  license agreements that typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  nonexclusive  nontransferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location  in  revenue arrangements with  multiple elements the  components
 are  all  separately and independently priced  within the related contracts
 allocation of  revenue  is consistent  with  pricing when  each  product  or
 service is sold separately  establishing vendor specific objective  evidence
 vsoe  generally  a deposit is  payable upon execution  of the  license
 agreement with additional  payments due  at specified  times after  contract
 signing  we recognize software license revenue upon delivery and acceptance
 of the software and documentation

 support  and  services  fees   are  generated  from  installation   services
 contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  atm and  debit
 card processing  services we  recognize  installation services  revenue  as
 services are performed under hourly contracts  and at the completion of  the
 installations under fixed fee contracts  revenues from software support are
 generated pursuant to annual agreements and are recognized ratably over  the
 life of the agreements  outsourcing services are performed through data and
 item centers revenues from outsourced item and data processing and atm  and
 debit card processing services are derived from monthly usage fees typically
 under fiveyear  service  contracts with  our  customers we  recognize  the
 revenues under these contracts as services are performed

 cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue

 cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 installation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers  operation
 of  our  data  and  item  centers  providing  services  for  our  outsourced
 customers atm  and debit  card processing  services and  direct  operation
 costs  these costs are recognized as they are incurred

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our  customers   revenues  from hardware  sales  are  recognized  when  the
 manufacturers ship the hardware directly to our customers  cost of hardware
 consists of the direct  and related costs of  purchasing the equipment  from
 the manufacturers and delivery to our customers  these costs are recognized
 at the same time as the related revenue

 we have two business  segments bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services  the respective segments include all related  license
 support and  service and  hardware sales  along with  the related  cost  of
 sales


 results of operations

 fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003

 fiscal year 2004  showed strong growth  in revenues and  improved gross  and
 operating margins which allowed us to  leverage a 16 increase in  revenues
 to a 26 increase in net income

 revenue  revenues  increased  16 from  4046 million  in fiscal  2003  to
 4674 million in fiscal 2004  fiscal 2004 license revenue increased 30 to
 626 million from 483 million  support and service revenue increased 20
 to 3113  million from  2605 million  in fiscal  2003   in fiscal  2004
 hardware revenue decreased by 2 to 935 million from 959 million

 license revenue grew by 143 million  dollars compared to last fiscal  year
 due  to  increased  delivery   of  software  relating   to  the  timing   of
 installations  support and service revenue which includes outsourcing in
 house support  atm and  debit card  processing and  installation  services
 increased by  508  million  and contributed  to  67  of  fiscal  revenues
 compared with 64  in fiscal  2003  the  increase reflects  an increase  of
 238 million for inhouse  support a 19  increase  from fiscal 2003  in
 house support  increased  due to  our  continued installation  of  core  and
 complementary products  during the  fiscal year  for  which most  of  these
 customers  contract  for  ongoing  support  service  beginning  upon  final
 installation  outsourcing services grew by 118 million which reflects  a
 17 increase in fiscal 2004 due to growth in volume with existing  customers
 and installations  of new  customers  which led  to  expansion of  our  data
 centers  atm  and debit card  processing services realized  growth of  96
 million for the  year with  an increase  of 36   we  began offering  these
 services to the  credit union segment  this year which  contributed to  the
 growth  installation services  grew by 56 million  or 15 over the  prior
 year correlating  to the  increase of  license revenue   recurring  revenue
 support and service revenue less installation services increased to 57 of
 total revenue in fiscal 2004 from 55 of total fiscal 2003 revenue

 hardware revenue remained relatively flat  year over year while  decreasing
 to 20 of revenues compared with  24 of fiscal 2003 revenues primarily  due
 to the  increase in  our license  revenue and  expansion and  growth in  our
 support and service revenue for the year

 cost  of  sales  cost of  sales increased  11 for  the year  from  2513
 million in fiscal 2003 to  2794 million in fiscal  2004  cost of  support
 and service increased 17  to 2077 million from  1783 million in  fiscal
 2003  the increase is primarily due  to a 12 increase in employee  related
 expenses for  increased headcount  and a  24 increase  in depreciation  and
 amortization expense included in the cost  of support and service  this  is
 due mainly to our  efforts to continue  improving operating  efficiencies by
 investing and upgrading technology  equipment  both  fiscal years cost  of
 support and service  remained constant  at 44 of  total revenue   cost  of
 license increased 22 from 39 million  in fiscal 2003 to 47 million  in
 fiscal 2004  mainly due  to  obligations to  third  party vendors  for  the
 software we resell  cost of hardware  decreased 3 to 670 million  or 14
 of total revenue in fiscal year 2004 from 691 million or 17 of revenue in
 2003 fiscal  year   the decrease  in  cost of  hardware correlates  to  the
 decrease in hardware revenue

 gross profit  gross profit increased  23 to 1880 million in fiscal  2004
 from 1533 million in fiscal 2003 the gross margin for fiscal 2004 was 40
 compared to 38 for fiscal 2003  gross profit on license revenue  increased
 135 million  or 30  in fiscal  2004   gross  margin on  license  revenue
 remained  consistent  at  92  for  both fiscal  years   the  gross  profit
 improvement is  due  to  a  significant increase  in  the  delivery  of  the
 companys  core and complementary software licenses  for fiscal year  2004
 delivery of third party license revenue and cost remained flat when compared
 with fiscal 2003

 gross profit  for support  and service  increased 214  million or  26  in
 fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal  2003 support and service gross  margin
 improved to 33  this year  from 32 in  the prior  year   the increase  is
 primarily due  to  increased volumes  increased  number of  customers  and
 continued  leveraging  of  resources  of  employees  and  equipment  in  our
 outsourcing and atmdebit card processing services

 hardware gross margin for fiscal year 2004 and fiscal 2003 remained even  at
 28

 operating expenses  operating expenses increased 17 for the current  year
 with the majority of  the increase generated  from research and  development
 expenses  research and development expenses increased 49 to 237  million
 for fiscal 2004 compared to 159 million for fiscal 2003  the increase is
 primarily attributable to a 45 increase in employee related  expenses  the
 increase includes standard salary  increases along with additional  employee
 headcount for  ongoing  development  of new  products  and  enhancements  to
 existing products in both segments of our business

 selling and  marketing  expenses increased  17  to 360  million  in  2004
 compared to 307  million for fiscal  year 2003  the increase  relates  to
 higher employee related expenses in fiscal  2004 compared with fiscal  2003
 which is  relatively  in line  with  the growth  in  revenue   general  and
 administrative expenses  remained  flat at  295  million for  both  fiscal
 years  this is due to overall cost control measures implemented  throughout
 the year

 interest income expense    interest income expense increased from  05
 million in fiscal  2003 to  09  million in  fiscal 2004  interest  income
 increased 60  from 06  million to  10 million  due to  higher  invested
 balances  interest expense decreased 3  from 110000 in fiscal year  2003
 to 107000 in fiscal 2004

 provision for  income taxes    the provision  for  income taxes  was  374
 million or 375 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2004 compared  with
 284 million or 365 of income before  income taxes in fiscal 2003   the
 increase in the  percentage for  fiscal 2004 is  due to  changes in  various
 state tax laws and the allocation of income amongst states

 net income   net  income increased  26 from  494 million  or 055  per
 diluted share in fiscal 2003 to 623 million or 068 per diluted share in
 fiscal 2004

 fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

 fiscal year 2003 was a profitable but  challenging year due to being one  of
 the most difficult markets the technology  industry has seen in more than  a
 decade revenue  was  relatively  flat  compared  to  the  prior  year  with
 decreased gross margins  primarily due to  a 7 increase  in cost of  sales
 which resulted in a 13 decrease in net income

 revenue  revenues increased 2 from 3967 million in fiscal 2002 to 4046
 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 license fees decreased 27
 support and service revenues increased 14 and hardware sales decreased 5

 reflecting the strength in new  outsourcing business revenues from  support
 and services  continues to  grow  increasing to  64  of revenues  in  2003
 compared to 58 of 2002 revenues the increase is composed of 108  million
 or 17 increase in outsourcing services  52 million or 24 growth in  atm
 and debit card processing services 164 million or 16 growth in  inhouse
 support and  a slight  decrease  of 06  million  or 2  for  installation
 services  recurring revenue support and service revenue less  installation
 services increased to 55 of total revenue in fiscal 2003 from 47 of total
 fiscal 2002 revenue

 continued softness in banking core system sales negatively impacted revenues
 from license fees  and hardware sales  in 2003 for  the year license  fees
 dropped 27 to  483 million  or 12 of  total 2003  revenues compared  to
 666 million or 17 of 2002 revenues  the decrease is due to the  overall
 reduced number of software  licenses delivered during the  year in our  bank
 segment hardware revenue  decreased 5 to  959 million or  24 of  fiscal
 2003  revenues  compared with 1013 million or 26 of fiscal 2002 revenues
 this decline is  primarily attributable to  the decrease  in software  sales
 which typically drives the sale of related hardware

 cost of sales  cost of sales increased 7 during the fiscal year primarily
 due to  a 9  increase in  employee  related expenses  included in  cost  of
 services  cost of license increased  55 from 25 million in fiscal  2002
 to 39 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to obligations to third  party
 vendors for  the software  we resell   cost  of services  increased 10  to
 1783 million or 44 of revenue  in fiscal 2003 compared to 1615  million
 or 41 of revenue in the fiscal 2002 which is in line with the increase  in
 revenue  cost of hardware decreased 3 from 714 million or 18 of revenue
 in year 2002 to 691 million or 17 of revenue in current 2003 fiscal year

 gross profit  gross profit decreased 5 from 1612 million in fiscal  2002
 to 1533 million in fiscal  2003  the total  gross margin for fiscal  2003
 was 38 compared  to 41 for  fiscal 2002   gross profit  on license  sales
 decreased 197 million or 31 and gross margin decreased from 96 in fiscal
 2002 to 92 in  fiscal 2003  the  decrease in gross profit  was due to  the
 overall weakness in the capital goods market and the reduction in the margin
 is primarily due to  the decrease in license  revenue which is our  highest
 margin revenue

 gross profit for  support and  services increased  150 million  or 22  in
 fiscal year  2003  compared to  fiscal  2002 support  and  service  margins
 continue to strengthen to  32 this year from  29 in the  prior year   the
 increase  is  primarily  due  to  increased  volumes  increased  number  of
 customers and  continued leveraging  of resources  in our  outsourcing  and
 atmdebit card processing services

 hardware gross margin for the current fiscal year 2003 was 28 compared  to
 30 margin in fiscal  year 2002   the decrease in  hardware margin for  the
 year is primarily attributable to the sales mix of products in fiscal  2003
 our hardware  sales included  a higher  percentage of  servers and  personal
 computers  related  to  networks  than  in  2002  network  hardware  has  a
 significantly  lower  margin  than midrange  hardware  and  reader  sorters
 another contributing factor to  lower gross margin  has been reduced  vendor
 incentives in fiscal 2003

 operating expenses  operating expenses increased  2 for the current  year
 with the majority of  the increase generated  from research and  development
 expenses research and development expenses went up by 27 to 159  million
 for fiscal 2003 as compared to 125 million for fiscal 2002  the  increase
 is primarily attributable to a 27 increase in employee related expenses for
 ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in
 both  segments  of  our  business  selling and  marketing  annual  expenses
 increased 4 to 307 million in  2003 compared to 294 million for  fiscal
 year 2002  general  and  administrative expenses  decreased  10  to  295
 million this year from  327 million in fiscal  year 2002 mainly due  from
 ongoing efforts to control expenses by management

 interest income expense    interest income expense decreased from  18
 million in fiscal  2002 to  05 million in  fiscal  2003  interest  income
 decreased 69 from 20 million to 06 million due to lower interest  rates
 on investments  interest expense decreased 81000 from 191000 in  fiscal
 year 2002 to 110000  in fiscal 2003   the decrease is  due to short  term
 borrowings being paid  off in january  2002 with  no additional  borrowings
 since that date

 provision for  income taxes    the provision  for  income taxes  was  284
 million or 365 of income before income taxes in fiscal 2003 compared with
 314 million or 36  of income before  income taxes in  fiscal 2002   the
 increase in the tax  rate in the current  fiscal year is  due to changes  in
 effective state income tax rates

 net income   net  income decreased  13  from 571  million or  62  per
 diluted share in fiscal 2002 to 494 million or 55 per diluted share  in

 revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 11  to
 3821 million in  fiscal 2004  from 3431 million  in fiscal  2003   this
 increase was primarily due to improved  license sales for most products  and
 continued growth  in support  and service  revenue   gross profit  in  this
 business segment increased  15 to  1546 million  or 40  gross margin  in
 fiscal 2004 from 1350 million or 39 gross margin for the year ended  june
 30 2003  the  increase in gross  profit is primarily  due to increases  in
 revenue combined with  improved procedures leverage  of infrastructure  and
 overall cost controls

 revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 1 from
 3393 million  in fiscal  2002 to  3431 million  in fiscal  2003   gross
 profit in this  business segment  decreased 6  from 1436  million or  42
 gross margin in fiscal 2002  to 1350 million or  39 gross margin for  the
 year ended june 30 2003  this decline in gross profit is primarily due  to
 the industry trend of an overall decrease in capital spending for the fiscal
 year and is reflected by the  significant decrease in software and  hardware
 revenues offset somewhat by the increase  in services revenue the  decrease
 in gross margin  is primarily due  to the significant  reduction in  license
 revenue which is our highest margin revenue

 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 to 853  million  in  fiscal  2004  from  615  million  in  fiscal  2003

 license sales and  strong growth  in support  and service  revenue from  new
 services  introduced  this  year  gross  profit in  this  business  segment
 increased from 183 million  or 30 gross profit  margin in fiscal 2003  to
 333 million or 39 gross profit margin  for the year ended  june 30 2004
 the credit  union  segment margin  growth  is primarily  due  to  additional
 products and  services  sold  which carry  a  higher  gross  profit  margin
 continued leverage of existing resources improved processes and  procedures
 combined with overall cost controls

 revenues  in  the  credit  union  systems  and  services  business   segment

 despite the sluggish economy the credit  union segment was able to  achieve
 growth in revenue and maintain a  consistent gross margin  the increase  in
 revenue was due to  additional core customers during  the year and  expanded
 product offerings in this segment

 recent accounting pronouncements

 effective november 22 2002 the emerging issues task force eitf reached
 a consensus  regarding  eitf issue  no  0216 accounting  by  a  customer
 including a reseller for cash consideration  received from a vendor   this
 consensus requires that payments from a vendor be classified as a  reduction
 to the price of the vendors goods and taken as a reduction to cost of sales
 unless the payments are 1 a  reimbursement for costs incurred to sell  the
 product or 2  a payment for  assets or services  provided  the  consensus
 also requires that payments  from a vendor be  recognized as a reduction  to
 cost of  sales  on a  rational  and systematic  basis   this  consensus  is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after  december 15 2002 july 1  2003
 for jha  the  adoption of this consensus  on july 1 2003  did not have  a
 material impact on the companys consolidated financial position or  results
 of operations

 in january  and  december 2003  the  financial accounting  standards  board
 fasb  issued  interpretation  no 46  fin  46  and  no  46 revised
 fin 46r  consolidation  of variable interest  entities vie  these
 statements which address accounting for entities commonly known as special
 purpose or  offbalancesheet  entities require  consolidation  of  certain
 interest or  arrangements  by  virtue of  holding  a  controlling  financial
 interest in  such  entities   certain  provisions  of fin  46r  related  to
 interests in specialpurposes entities were applicable for the period  ended
 march 31 2004  the  company has considered the  application of fin 46  and
 fin 46r to certain business relationships  and concluded that the  adoption
 of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not  and
 is not expected  to have a  material impact on  the consolidated results  of
 operations and financial position

 in may 2003  the fasb issued  statement of  financial accounting  standards
 sfas  no  150  accounting  for  certain  financial  instruments   with
 characteristics of both liabilities  and equity   sfas no 150  establishes
 standards for  how  an  issuer classifies  and  measures  certain  financial
 instruments with characteristics of both liabilities  and equity  sfas  no
 150 requires classification  of a financial  instrument that  is within  its
 scope as a liability or an  asset in some circumstances   sfas no 150  is
 effective for financial instruments entered into  or modified after may  31
 2003 and was  therefore effective for  the company on  july 1  2003   the
 adoption of this standard  did not have a  material impact on the  companys
 financial statements

 in december  2003 the  securities and  exchange commission  sec  issued
 staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 revenue recognition  sab no 104
 supercedes sab no 101  revenue recognition in  financial statements   the
 primary purpose of sab no 104  is to rescind accounting guidance  contained
 in sab no 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded
 as a result of the issuance of eitf issue no 0021  additionally sab  no
 104  rescinds  the  secs   revenue  recognition  in  financial   statements
 frequently asked questions and answers the  faq issued with sab no  101
 that  has  been codified  in sec  topic 13  revenue  recognition  selected
 portions of the  faq have been  incorporated into sab  no 104   while  the
 wording of sab no 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf issue no
 0021 the  revenue recognition  principles of  sab no  101 remain  largely
 unchanged by the issuance of sab no 104   the adoption of sab no 104  did
 not have a material impact on the companys financial statements

 critical accounting policies

 we  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted   in  the  united  states   the
 significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the  consolidated
 financial statements   certain of  these accounting  policies as  discussed
 below require  management to  make estimates  and assumptions  about  future
 events  that  could  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses and  disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities  actual results may differ from these estimates under different
 assumptions or conditions

 we record  revenue in  accordance with  statement  of position  sop  972
 software revenue recognition  as amended  we recognize revenue from  sales
 of hardware software and services and from arrangements involving  multiple
 elements of each of the above  revenue for multiple element arrangements is
 recorded based on contractual amounts which  are determined based upon  the
 price charged  when  sold  separately   revenue  is  not  recognized  until
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee
 is  fixed  and  determinable  and  collectibility  is  probable  sales  of
 hardware and equipment  are  recorded when title and risk of loss transfers
 licensing  revenues  are  recorded  upon  delivery  and  acceptance  of  the
 software  service fees for training and installation are recognized as  the
 services are  provided   support  revenues  are recorded  evenly  over  the
 related contract period

 as discussed previously in  the overview the  company has established  vsoe
 separately for  all the  individual components  of licensing  installation
 support and  hardware and  recognizes revenue  separately for  the  various
 components  the components are all independently priced and consistent with
 pricing when  each element  is sold  separately   there  are no  rights  of
 return conditions of acceptance or price protections in our contracts

 the calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and
 intangible assets  which have   been  examined for  their useful  life  and
 determined that no impairment  exists  we believe  it is unlikely that  any
 significant changes  to the  useful lives  of  our tangible  and  intangible
 assets will  occur in  the near  term but  rapid changes  in technology  or
 changes in market  conditions could result  in revisions  to such  estimates
 that could materially  affect the  carrying value  of these  assets and  the
 companys future consolidated operating results  all long lived assets  are
 tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled periodic basis

 of integrated  computer systems  providing  data processing  and  management
 information to banks credit unions and other financial institutions in  the
 united states  the company was formed  in 1976 and made its initial  public

 improve  our  customers   management  of  their   entire  backoffice   and
 customermember interaction processes  we believe our solutions enable  our

 million in fiscal 2003 representing a compound annual growth rate over this
 fiveyear period  of 210   net  income has  grown from  327 million  in
 fiscal 1999 to 494 million in  fiscal 2003 a compound annual growth  rate
 of 153

 industry background

 according to the automation in banking 2003 report united states  financial
 institutions  including  commercial  banks  thrifts  and  credit   unions
 increased spending on hardware software services and telecommunications to
 416 billion in calendar  2002 from 343 billion  in 1999 representing  a
 compound annual growth rate of 60  the increase of industry spending  was
 24 from december 31 2001 to december 31 2002 industry surveys  continue
 to show that financial institutions believe upgrading information technology
 is one  of the  most important  issues  to their  continued success  and  to
 enhance growth and efficiencies  we believe that the market opportunity for
 providers of hardware and software systems maintenance support and related
 outsourcing services targeted toward financial institutions will continue to
 grow as  a  result of  the  competitive pressures  within  their  respective
 industries

 there  are  approximately  8400  commercial banks  and  9900 credit unions
 in  the  united  states  our  primary  market  segment  which  represented
 approximately 85 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 is commercial
 banks  with  less  than  300  billion  in  assets  of  which  there  were
 approximately  8350   at  december  31  2002   consolidation  within  the
 financial services industry has resulted in a 2 compound annual  decline in
 the population of  commercial banks and  a 12 compound  annual decline  in
 their aggregate assets between  1999 and 2002 our  other market segment  is
 credit unions within the united states and represented approximately 15 of
 our total revenues in  fiscal 2003   these are cooperative  notforprofit
 financial institutions organized  to promote savings  and provide credit  to
 their members   as of  december 31  2002 there  were approximately  9900
 federally insured credit unions in the  united states  although the  number
 of these credit unions has declined  at a 30 compound annual rate  between
 1999 and 2002 their  aggregate assets have increased  at a compound  annual
 growth rate of 97 to 5571 billion at december 31 2002

 we believe that  commercial and  regional banks  and credit  unions play  an
 important role  with  the geographic  and  demographic communities  and  the
 customers they serve  typically customers of these financial  institutions
 rely on them because of their ability to provide personalized relationship
 based service and their focus on retail commercial and business needs   we
 believe these core strengths will allow our financial institution  customers
 to effectively  compete  with other  banks  credit unions  and  alternative
 financial institutions  in order to succeed and to maintain strong customer
 relationships we believe these banks and credit unions must continue to

          focus on  excellence in  delivery to  customers of  their  primary
           products and service offerings

          sell more  products and  services  to existing  customers  through
           utilization of customer relationship management crm products

          implement  advanced  technologies   such  as  imaging   platform
           automation and internet banking

          use advanced  technologies in  backoffice operations  to  improve
           operating efficiency and control costs  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers and

          integrate products  and services  into their  core  complementary
           service offerings and data  processing infrastructure to  provide
           competitive products and services to their customers

 according to automation in  banking 2003 in 2002  approximately 56 of  all
 commercial banks and 69 of all credit unions utilized inhouse hardware and
 software systems to perform  all of their core  systems and data  processing
 functions  offsite data processing centers provided system services on  an
 outsourced basis for 44 of all banks and  31 of all credit unions   since
 the mid1980s banks have tended to shift their data processing requirements
 inhouse from outsourcing such  functions to thirdparty  data centers   of
 the commercial banks with under 500  million of total assets in the  united
 states with  inhouse  installations approximately  51  25 9  and  8
 utilize ibm unisys other unixbased platforms  and ncr respectively   no
 other specific hardware platform had more than a 7 share of the market

 the internet continues to  become a more powerful  and efficient medium  for
 the  delivery  of  financial  services  including  internet  banking  bill
 payment bill  presentment  and other  services  for individuals  and  cash
 management and  other services  for the  commercial customers  of  financial
 institutions  financial institutions provide internet banking solutions  to
 retain  customers  attract  new  customers  reduce  operating  costs  and
 gain noninterest  sources  of  revenue   according  to  industry  sources
 approximately 65 of  banks and 64  of credit unions  in the united  states
 offer internet banking  we believe that commercial banks and credit  unions
 have a potential risk of losing customers to other financial institutions if
 they do not offer competitive internet banking services

           the highestvalue products and services in the market  we believe
           we have achieved  a reputation as  a premium  product and  service
           provider

          continue  to  expand  our  product  and  service  offerings    we
           continually upgrade our core software applications  and expand our
           complementary  product  and  service   offerings  to  respond   to
           technological  advances  and  the  changing  requirements  of  our
           clients  for  example we offer  several turnkey  solutions that
           enable financial institutions to rapidly deploy  sophisticated new
           products and  services    our  integrated  solutions  enable  our
           customers to offer competitive  services relative to larger  banks
           and alternative financial institutions  we intend to  continue to

           services as well  as provide additional  services such as  network
           services and computer facilities design

          expand our existing customer relationships   we seek to  increase
           the information  technology products  and services  we provide  to
           those customers that do not utilize our full range of products and
           services  in  this way  we are  able to  increase revenues  from
           current customers  with  minimal additional  sales  and  marketing
           expenses

          expand  our  customer  base    we  seek  to  establish  longterm
           relationships with new customers  through our sales and  marketing
           efforts and selected acquisitions   as of june  30 2003 we  had
           over 3000 customers up from 1400 in 1999

          build recurring revenue  we  enter into contracts with  customers
           to provide services that meet their information technology  needs
           we provide  ongoing  software  support for our inhouse customers
           additionally we  provide  data  processing  for  our  outsourcing
           customers  and  atm  transaction   switching  services  both   on

           clients while expanding our operating margins

          attract and retain capable employees   we believe attracting  and
           retaining highquality  employees is  essential to  our  continued
           growth and success  our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees a  strategy we  believe has  resulted in  low  employee
           turnover  in addition we selectively use employee stock  options
           to serve as a strong incentive and retention tool  in april 2003
           the company  granted  approximately  3670000  stock  options  to
           approximately 2100 full time employees or  94 of all full  time
           employees as of that date

 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings
 typically we  upgrade  our  core software  applications  and  complementary
 services once per year  we believe our research and development efforts are
 highly efficient because  of the extensive  experience of  our research  and
 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer
 driven  through our regular contact with customers at user group  meetings
 sales contacts and through our  ongoing maintenance services our  customers
 inform us of the new products and functionalities they desire

 sales and marketing

 our primary markets consist of commercial banks and credit unions  we  have
 not devoted  significant  marketing and  sales  efforts to  other  financial
 institutions such as thrifts

 our sales  efforts are  conducted by  dedicated field  sales forces  inside
 sales teams  and technical  sales  support teams  for  each of  our  market
 segments  all  of  which  are  overseen  by  regional sales  managers  our
 dedicated field  sales force  is responsible  for pursuing  lead  generation
 activities and representing the  majority of our  products and solutions  to
 current and  prospective clients   our  inside  sales force  sells  certain
 complementary products to our existing customers  all sales force personnel
 have responsibility for a specific territory  the sales support team writes
 business proposals  and contracts  and  prepares responses  to  requestfor
 proposals regarding our software and hardware  solutions  all of our  sales
 professionals  receive  a  base  salary  and  performancebased   commission
 compensation

 our marketing efforts consist of sponsorship and attendance at trade  shows
 email newsletters print media advertisement placements telemarketing and
 national and regional  marketing campaigns   we  also conduct  a number  of
 national user group  meetings each year  which enable us  to keep in  close
 contact with  our customers  and demonstrate  new products  and services  to
 them

 we have 38 installations  in the caribbean  primarily through the  marketing
 efforts  of   our  whollyowned   foreign  sales   subsidiary  jack   henry
 international limited  our international sales  accounted for less than  1
 of our total revenues

 backlog

 our backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services prior  to
 delivery  and  the  minimum  amounts  due  on  the  remaining  portion   of
 outsourcing  contracts  which  are  typically  for  fiveyear  periods  and
 represents the  minimum  guaranteed  payments  over  the  remainder  of  the
 contract period  our  backlog at june  30 2003 was  695 million for  in
 house products and  services and  1137 million  for outsourcing  services
 with a total backlog of 1831 million of the 1137 million amount of  the
 backlog for  outsourcing service  at june  30 2003  805 million  is  not
 expected to be  realized in  our current fiscal  year due  to the  longterm
 nature of many of  our outsourcing service contracts   backlog at june  30
 2002 was 528 million for inhouse products and services and 889  million
 for outsourcing  services with  a total  backlog of  1417  million   our
 backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly due to
 various factors  including  slower  contract processing  rates  during  the
 summer months

 competition

 the  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions  is  competitive  and  fragmented  and  we  expect   continued
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets  some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial  resources
 the  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications features and  functionality
 flexibility and  ease of  use customer  support references  from  existing
 customers and price  we compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing  products  and  services  to  financial  institutions  including
 fidelity information services  inc fiserv inc  intercept and  marshall
 and ilsley corporation  in addition we compete with a number of  providers
 that offer one  or more specialized  products or services   there has  been
 significant consolidation among providers of information technology products
 and services to  financial institutions and  we believe this  consolidation
 will continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks

 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology  we have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks  none of our technology is
 patented   instead  we  rely on a  combination of  contractual rights  and
 copyrights trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology  we generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees  consultants   resellers  customers  and   potential
 customers  we restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further limit  the disclosure  and use  of other  proprietary information
 despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized  parties
 may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology
 we cannot be sure the steps taken by us  in this regard will be adequate  to
 prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will  not
 independently develop technologies are substantially equivalent or  superior
 to our technology

 government regulation

 the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation  our current and prospective customers which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as  communityregional  banks  and  credit
 unions operate  in  markets  that are  subject  to  substantial  regulatory
 oversight and supervision   we must ensure our  products and services  work
 within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to  our
 customers including those under the federal truthinlending and  truthin

                                 risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond their  control
 the following is  a  description of some of  the important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired

 changes  within  the banking industry could  reduce demand for our products
 in the current  environment of  low interest  rates the  profit margins  of
 commercial  banks  and  credit  unions  have narrowed  as the  economy  has
 stumbled loan demand has slackened and loan defaults have increased  as  a
 result many banks have slowed or stopped their capital spending  including
 spending on  computer software  and hardware  affecting both  sales to  new
 customers and upgradecomplimentary product sales to existing customers

 we may not be able to manage rapid growth   we have grown at a rapid  pace
 both internally  and  through  acquisitions  our  expansion  has  and  will
 continue to place  significant demands on  our administrative  operational
 financial and management personnel and systems   we cannot assure you  that
 we will be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt
 our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology  we
 could lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business   the
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes   these  factors and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services   if we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services we may incur
 unanticipated expenses lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 acquisitions may be  costly and difficult  to integrate   we have  acquired
 several  businesses  and   will  continue  to   explore  possible   business
 combinations in the future   we may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired  companies  we  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services  diversion  of  managements
 attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets  without additional acquisitions
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to meet  competitive challenges   if  our
 integration strategies fail our  business financial condition and  results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 if our strategic  relationship with  ibm were  terminated it  could have  a
 negative  impact  on  the  continuing  success of  our  business   we  have
 developed a strategic relationship with ibm  as part of this  collaborative
 relationship we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  ibm  business partner  agreement  and resell  maintenance  on  ibm
 hardware products to our customers  much of our software is designed to  be
 compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers
  if  ibm  were   to  terminate   or  fundamentally   modify  our   strategic
 relationship our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings would  suffer   we could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers

 competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services  we expect  competition in the markets we serve  will
 remain vigorous  we compete on  the basis of product quality  reliability
 performance ease  of  use quality  of  support  and  pricing   we  cannot
 guarantee that we  will be able  to compete successfully  with our  existing
 competitors or with companies entering our  markets in the future   certain
 of our  competitors  have  strong  financial  marketing  and  technological
 resources and in some cases a larger customer  base than we do  they  may
 be able to adapt more quickly to  new or emerging technologies or to  devote
 greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management  our  company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated in a small  number of key employees  if  we
 lose one or more of our key employees we  could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss  we do not  have
 employment agreements  with  any  of our  executive  officers  however  we
 currently have a management succession plan in place

 consolidation of  financial  institutions could  reduce  the number  of  our
 customers  and  potential  customers   our  primary   market  consists   of
 approximately 8400 commercial banks and 9900 credit unions  the number of
 commercial banks and credit unions has decreased as a result of mergers  and
 acquisitions over  the  last five  years  and  is expected  to  continue  to
 decrease as  more consolidation  occurs which  will  reduce our  number  of
 potential  customers  as  a  result  of  this consolidation  some  of  our
 existing customers could terminate or refuse to renew their contracts  with
 us and potential customers could break off negotiations with us

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations   the
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation  as a supplier of services to financial institutions some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the office  of the  comptroller of  the
 currency the  federal  reserve  board and  the  federal  deposit  insurance
 corporation among  other  regulatory  agencies   these  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and  regulations  in
 addition existing  laws  regulations  and policies  could  be  amended  or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on  our  existing operations or that  limits our future growth or expansion
 our customers  are also  regulated entities  and the  form and  content  of
 actions by regulatory  authorities could determine  both the decisions  they
 make concerning the purchase of data  processing and other services and  the
 timing and implementation of these decisions  the development of  financial
 services over the  internet has  raised concerns  with respect  to the  use
 confidentiality and security  of private customer  information   regulatory
 agencies  congress  and   state  legislatures   are  considering   numerous
 regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and
 to require compliance by the industry with standards and policies that  have
 not been defined

 network or  internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business  we rely on standard  network and internet security systems  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data   computer
 networks and the  internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems  in  addition advances in  computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers  security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products  we may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches   eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions delays or cessation of service  to users any of which  could
 harm our business

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease   computer   hardware  technology  is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could cause us to  lose
 customers   damage  or  destruction   that  interrupts  our  provision   of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment  although we  have installed backup systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services  in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption  in addition a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
    
          results of operations
          

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected financial data  and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report

 overview

 we  provide integrated computer systems  for  inhouse and  outsourced  data
 processing to commercial banks  with under  300 billion  in total  assets
 credit  unions  and other  financial institutions  we  have  developed  and
 acquired  banking and  credit  union application software  systems  that  we
 market   together   with  compatible  computer   hardware   to   financial
 institutions throughout the  united states  we also perform data conversion
 and software installation for  the implementation of our systems and provide
 continuing customer  support services after the systems  are installed  for
 our customers  who  prefer not  to make an  upfront capital  investment  in
 software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services on
 an  outsourced  basis  through  our  eight  data  centers  and  sixteen item
 processing centers located throughout the united states

 we derive revenues  from three primary sources which include gross customer
 reimbursements received  for out of pocket expenses incurred and reported in
 the respective lines of revenue

    sales of software licenses

    support and service fees which include installation services and

    hardware sales

 over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 2043 million
 in fiscal 1999  to 4046  million in  fiscal 2003  income from  continuing
 operations has grown from 327 million  in fiscal 1999 to 494 million  in
 fiscal 2003  this growth  has resulted  primarily from  internal  expansion
 supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing  us to develop and  acquire
 new products and  services and expand  the number of  customers who use  our
 core software systems to approximately 2450 as of june 30 2003

 since july 1998 we have completed 11 accretive acquisitions nine of  these
 acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and
 our consolidated financial statements include  the results of operations  of
 the  acquired  companies  from  their  respective  acquisition  dates   the
 remaining two acquisitions were accounted for using the poolingofinterests
 method

 license revenue represents  the sale  and delivery  of application  software
 systems contracted with  us by  the customer   we  license our  proprietary
 software products under standard license agreements which typically  provide
 the customer  with  a  nonexclusive  nontransferable  right  to  use  the
 software on  a  single  computer and  for  a  single  financial  institution
 location  in revenue arrangements  with multiple  elements  the components
 are all separately and independently priced  within  the related  contracts
 allocation of  revenue  is consistent  with  pricing when  each  product  or
 service is sold separately  establishing vendor specific objective  evidence
 vsoe generally 25 of license fees  are payable upon execution of  the
 license agreement  with additional  payments due  at specified  times  after
 contract signing  we  recognize  100  of  software  license  revenue  upon
 delivery and acceptance of the software and documentation

 support  and  services  fees   are  generated  from  installation   services
 contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist  the
 customer in operating the  systems and to enhance  and update the  software
 and from providing  outsourced data processing  services and  atm and  debit
 card processing  services we  recognize  installation services  revenue  as
 services are performed under hourly contracts  and at the completion of  the
 installations under fixed fee contracts  revenues from software support are
 generated pursuant to annual agreements and are recognized ratably over  the
 life of the agreements outsourcing services are performed through data  and
 item centers revenues from  outsourced  processing and  atm and debit  card
 processing services  are derived  from monthly  usage fees  typically  under
 fiveyear service contracts  with our customers  we recognize the  revenues
 under these contracts as services are performed

 cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with
 license fee revenue

 cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 installation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers  operation
 of  our  data  and  item  centers  providing  services  for  our  outsourced
 customers atm  and debit  card processing  services and  direct  operation
 costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our  customers  revenues  from  hardware  sales  are  recognized  when  the
 manufacturers ship the hardware directly to our customers cost of  hardware
 consists of the direct  and related costs of  purchasing the equipment  from
 the manufacturers and delivery to our customers these costs are  recognized
 at the same time as the related revenue

 we have two business  segments bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services  the respective segments include all related  license
 support and service customer reimbursements  and hardware sales along  with
 the related cost of sales


 results of operations

 fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

 revenue  revenues increased 2 from 3967 million in fiscal 2002 to 4046
 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 license fees decreased 27
 support and service revenues increased 14 and hardware sales decreased 5
 beginning in fiscal 2003  customer reimbursements received for passthrough
 costs are  now included  and  presented in  the  correlating line  items  of
 support and service  or hardware revenues  and costs  respectively   prior
 years have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation

 reflecting the strength in new  outsourcing business revenues from  support
 and services  continues to  grow  increasing to  64  of revenues  in  2003
 compared to 58 of 2002 revenues the increase is composed of 108  million
 or 17 increase in outsourcing services  52 million or 24 growth in  atm
 and debit card processing services 164 million or 16 growth in  inhouse
 support and  a  slight decrease  of  06  million or  2  for  installation
 services  recurring revenue support and service revenue less  installation
 services increased to 55 of total revenue in fiscal 2003 from 47 of total
 fiscal 2002 revenue

 continued softness in banking core system sales negatively impacted revenues
 from license fees  and hardware sales  in 2003 for  the year license  fees
 dropped 27 to  483 million  or 12 of  total 2003  revenues compared  to
 666 million or 17 of 2002 revenues  the decrease is due to the  overall
 reduced number of software  licenses delivered during the  year in our  bank
 segment hardware revenue  decreased 5 to  959 million or  24 of  fiscal
 2003 revenues compared with 1013 million or 26 of fiscal 2002 revenues
 this decline is  primarily attributable to  the decrease  in software  sales
 which typically drives the sale of related hardware

 cost of sales  cost of sales increased 7 during the fiscal year primarily
 due to  a 9  increase in  employee  related expenses  included in  cost  of
 services  cost of license increased  55 from 25 million in fiscal  2002
 to 39 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to obligations to third  party
 vendors for  the software  we resell   cost  of services  increased 10  to
 1783 million or 44 of revenue  in fiscal 2003 compared to 1615  million
 or 41 of revenue in the fiscal 2002 which is in line with the increase  in
 revenue  cost of hardware decreased 3 from 714 million or 18 of revenue
 in year 2002 to 691 million or 17 of revenue in current 2003 fiscal year

 gross profit  gross profit decreased 5 from 1612 million in fiscal  2002
 to 1533 million in fiscal  2003  the total  gross margin for fiscal  2003
 was 38 compared  to 41 for  fiscal 2002   gross profit  on license  sales
 decreased 197 million or 31 and gross margin decreased from 96 in fiscal
 2002 to 92 in  fiscal 2003  the  decrease in gross profit  was due to  the
 overall weakness in the capital goods market and the reduction in the margin
 is primarily due to decrease in license revenue which is our highest margin
 revenue

 gross profit for  support and  services increased  150 million  or 22  in
 fiscal year  2003  compared to  fiscal  2002 support  and  service  margins
 continue to strengthen to  32 this year from  29 in the  prior year   the
 increase  is  primarily  due  to  increased  volumes  increased  number  of
 customers and  continued  leveraging of  resources  in our  outsourcing  and
 atmdebit card processing services

 hardware gross margin for the current fiscal year 2003 was 28 compared  to
 30 margin in fiscal  year 2002   the decrease in  hardware margin for  the
 year is primarily attributable to the sales mix of products in fiscal  2003
 our hardware  sales included  a higher  percentage of  servers and  personal
 computers  related  to  networks  than  in  2002  network  hardware  has  a
 significantly  lower  margin  than  midrange  hardware  and reader  sorters
 another contributing factor to  lower gross margin  has been reduced  vendor
 incentives in fiscal 2003

 operating expenses  operating expenses increased  2 for the current  year
 with the majority of  the increase generated  from research and  development
 expenses research and development expenses went up by 27 to 159  million
 for fiscal 2003 as compared to 125 million for fiscal 2002  the  increase
 is primarily attributable to a 27 increase in employee related expenses for
 ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products in
 both  segments  of  our  business  selling and  marketing  annual  expenses
 increased 4 to 307 million in  2003 compared to 294 million for  fiscal
 year 2002  general  and  administrative expenses  decreased  10  to  295
 million this year from  327 million in fiscal  year 2002 mainly due  from
 ongoing efforts to control expenses by management

 interest income expense   interest income  expense decreased from  18
 million in fiscal  2002 to  05 million in  fiscal 2003   interest  income
 decreased 69 from 20 million to 06 million due to lower interest  rates
 on investments  interest expense decreased 81000 from 191000 in  fiscal
 year 2002 to 110000  in fiscal 2003   the decrease is  due to short  term
 borrowings being paid  off in january  2002 with  no additional  borrowings
 since that date

 provision for  income taxes    the provision  for  income taxes  was  284
 million or 365  of income before  income taxes in  fiscal 2003  compared
 with 314 million or 36  of income before income  taxes in fiscal 2002
 the increase in the tax rate in the current fiscal year is due to changes in
 effective state income tax rates

 net income   net  income decreased  13  from 571  million or  62  per
 diluted share in fiscal 2002 to 494 million or 55 per diluted share  in
 fiscal 2003


 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001

 revenue  revenues  increased by 8  from 3669 million  in fiscal 2001  to
 3967 million  in fiscal  2002 compared  to fiscal  2001 license  revenue
 decreased 5 from 701 million to 666 million in fiscal 2002 support and

 business segment discussion

 revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 1 from
 3393 million  in fiscal  2002 to  3431 million  in fiscal  2003   gross
 profit in this  business segment  decreased 6  from 1436  million or  42
 gross margin in fiscal 2002  to 1350 million or  39 gross margin for  the
 year ended june 30 2003 this decline  in gross profit is primarily due  to
 the industry trend of an overall decrease in capital spending for the fiscal
 year and is reflected by the  significant decrease in software and  hardware
 revenues offset somewhat by the increase  in services revenue the  decrease
 in gross margin  is primarily due  to the significant  reduction in  license
 revenue which is our highest margin revenue

 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 from 573  million  in  fiscal  2002  to  615  million  in  fiscal  2003
 representing a 7 increase  gross profit in this business segment increased
 from 177  million or  31 gross  profit  margin in  fiscal 2002  to  183
 million or  30 gross  profit margin  for the  year ended  june 30  2003
 despite the sluggish economy the credit  union segment was able to  achieve
 growth in revenue and maintain a fairly flat gross margin  the increase  in
 revenue was due to  additional core customers during  the year and  expanded
 product offerings in this segment

 revenues in the bank systems and services business segment increased 7 from
 3180 million  in fiscal  2001 to  3393 million  in fiscal  2002   gross
 profit in this business segment increased  4 from 1381 million in  fiscal
 2001 to 1436 million for the year ended june 30 2002 due to decrease  in
 amortization expense  relating to  goodwill as  a result  of the  impact  of
 adopting sfas no 142 and the overall cost control measures put in place  by
 management   the  slight  increases which  are  significantly  lower  than
 historical levels are  primarily due to  the industry trend  of an  overall
 decrease in capital spending for the year which continued to be impacted by
 the events of september 11th and the weakened ongoing economy

 revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased
 from 489  million  in  fiscal  2001  to  573  million  in  fiscal  2002

 increased from  135 million  in fiscal  2001  to 177  million or  a  31
 increase for the  year ended june  30 2002   gross profit margin  remained
 strong due to  decrease in amortization  expense relating to  goodwill as  a
 result of the impact of adopting sfas  no 142 and the overall cost  control
 measures put in  place by  management   despite the  sluggish economy  the
 credit union segment  had significant growth  in revenue   the increase  in
 revenue was due to the addition of core customers during the year

 liquidity and capital resources

 we have historically generated positive cash  flow from operations and  have
 generally used existing  resources and  funds generated  from operations  to
 meet capital requirements  we expect this trend to continue in the future

 million at june 30 2003 from 178 million at june 30 2002 cash provided
 by operations  was 989  million for  the fiscal  year ended  june 2003  as
 compared to 899 million for the fiscal  year ended 2002  included in  our
 june 30  2003 annual  inhouse support  billing was  an increase  of  250
 million because of  a shift in  billing cycles for  our previously  acquired
 customers to  our fiscal  yearend from  a  calendar year   this  shift  in
 billing from  the prior  year was  the primary  reason for  the increase  in
 accounts receivable of 197 million and deferred revenues of 231 million
 in 2003 there  was additional depreciation  expense of 31  million and  a
 65 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses cash used in

 expansion at our monett complex and a new facility in birmingham al  65
 million for acquisitions  and 52  million for  capitalization of  software

 instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003  the  company  does
 not  expect  the  adoption  of fasb no 150 to have a material effect on our
 operating results or financial condition

 critical accounting policies

 we  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted   in  the  united  states   the
 significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the  consolidated
 financial statements   certain of  these accounting  policies as  discussed
 below require  management to  make estimates  and assumptions  about  future
 events  that  could  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses and  disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities  actual results may differ from these estimates under different
 assumptions or conditions

 we record  revenue in  accordance with  statement  of position  sop  972
 software revenue recognition as amended   we recognize revenue from  sales
 of hardware software and services and from arrangements involving  multiple
 elements of each of  the above  revenue  for multiple element  arrangements
 are recorded based on contractual amounts  which are determined based  upon
 the price charged  when sold separately   revenue is  not recognized  until
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee
 is  fixed  and  determinable  and collectibility  is  probable   sales  of
 hardware and equipment  are  recorded when title and risk of loss transfers
 licensing  revenues  are  recorded  upon  delivery  and  acceptance  of  the
 software  service fees for training and installation  are recognized as the
 services are  provided   support  revenues  are recorded  evenly  over  the
 related contract period

 as discussed previously in  the overview the  company has established  vsoe
 separately for  all the  individual components  of licensing  installation
 support and  hardware and  recognizes revenue  separately for  the  various
 components  the components are all independently priced and consistent with
 pricing when  each element  is sold  separately   there  are no  rights  of
 return conditions of acceptance or price protections in our contracts

 the calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and
 intangibles  we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to  the
 useful lives of our  tangible and intangible assets  will occur in the  near
 term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could
 result in  revisions to  such estimates  that  could materially  affect  the
 carrying value  of  these  assets  and  the  companys  future  consolidated
 operating results

 item 1   business

 jack henry  associates inc jha or the company is a leading provider
 of integrated computer systems  to banks with under  100 billion of  total
 assets credit unions and other financial institutions in the united states
 we offer a complete  integrated suite  of data processing system  solutions
 to improve  our  customers  management  of  their  entire  backoffice  and
 customer  interaction  processes   we  believe  our  solutions  enable  our
 customers to  provide better  service to  their customers  and compete  more
 effectively against larger  banks credit unions  and alternative  financial
 institutions  our customers either install and use our systems inhouse  or
 outsource these operations to us  we perform data conversion hardware  and
 software installation and software  customization for the implementation  of
 our systems and applications  we  also provide continuing customer  support
 services  to  ensure  proper  product  performance  and  reliability  which
 provides us with continuing client relationships and recurring revenue  for
 our customers who prefer  not to acquire hardware  and software we  provide
 outsourcing services through eight data centers and fourteen item processing
 centers located across the united states

 our gross revenue  has grown from  1563 million in  fiscal 1998 to  3967
 million in fiscal 2002 representing a compound annual growth rate over this
 fiveyear period of 246  net income from continuing operations has  grown
 from 242  million  in fiscal  1998  to 571  million  in fiscal  2002  a
 compound annual growth rate of 19

 industry background

 according to the automation in banking 2002 report united states  financial
 institutions  including  commercial  banks  thrifts  and  credit   unions
 increased spending on hardware software services and telecommunications to
 407 billion in 2001  from 310 billion in  1998 representing a  compound
 annual growth  rate  of  84   industry  surveys  continue  to  show  that
 financial institutions believe  upgrading technology is  the most  important
 issue to their continued  success  we believe  that the market  opportunity
 for providers of  hardware and  software systems  maintenance support  and
 related outsourcing  services targeted  toward  community banks  and  credit
 unions will continue  to grow  as a result  of the  competitive pressure  on
 financial institutions

 there are approximately 8600 commercial banks  and 10200 credit unions  in
 the united  states   our primary  market has  historically been  commercial
 banks  with  less  than  100  billion  in  assets  of  which  there  were
 approximately 8500 at december  31 2001  as  of december 31 2001  banks
 with under 100 billion in assets had aggregate assets of approximately  2
 trillion  however consolidation within the financial services industry has
 resulted in a  2 compound annual  decline in the  population of  commercial
 banks and a 04 compound annual  decline in their aggregate assets  between
 1997 and 2001 we also serve credit unions in the united states  these  are
 cooperative notforprofit  financial  institutions  organized  to  promote
 savings and provide credit to their members  as of december 31 2001 there
 were 10200 federally insured credit unions in the united states   although
 the number of  these credit unions  has declined at  a 26 compound  annual
 rate between 1997 and 2001 their aggregate assets have increased at an 89
 compound annual rate to 5016 billion in 2001

 we believe that communityregional banks and credit unions play an important
 role with  the geographic  and demographic  communities and  customers  they
 serve  typically customers of these banks and credit unions rely on  these
 financial institutions  because of  their ability  to provide  personalized
 relationshipbased service and their focus  on local community and  business
 needs  we believe these core strengths will allow communityregional  banks
 and credit unions to effectively compete  with larger banks and  alternative
 financial institutions  in order to succeed and to maintain strong customer
 relationships we believe these banks and credit unions must continue to

          focus on their primary products and services

          respond rapidly to customer demand for new products and services

          implement advanced  technologies  such as  imaging  and  internet
           banking

          use advanced  technologies in  backoffice operations  to  improve
           operating efficiency and  control costs  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers and

          integrate products and services into their core service  offerings
           and data processing infrastructure to provide the same wide range
           of services as are offered by larger banks

 in 2001 approximately  57 of commercial  banks utilized inhouse  hardware
 and software  systems  to  perform  all  of  their  core  systems  and  data
 processing functions   offsite  data processing  centers provided  systems
 services on an outsourced basis for the  remaining 43 of banks  since  the
 mid1980s banks have tended to shift their data processing requirements in
 house from outsourcing such functions to  thirdparty data centers  of  the
 community banks  with under  500 million  of total  assets   in the  united
 states with  inhouse installations approximately 58 21 and 7  utilize
 ibm unisys  and ncr  hardware respectively   no  other specific  hardware
 platform had more than a 5 share of the market

 the internet continues to  become a more powerful  and efficient medium  for
 the  delivery  of  financial  services  including  internet  banking  bill
 payment bill  presentment  and other  services  for individuals  and  cash
 management and  other services  for the  commercial customers  of  financial
 institutions  financial  institutions  provide  internet  banking solutions
 to  retain  customers  attract  new customers reduce  operating costs and
 gain noninterest  sources  of  revenue   according  to  industry  sources
 approximately 60 of banks in the united states offer internet banking   we
 believe that communityregional financial institutions risk losing customers

           as network services and computer facilities design

          expand our existing customer relationships   we seek to  increase
           the information  technology products  and services  we provide  to
           those customers that do not utilize our full range of products and
           services  in  this way  we are  able to  increase revenues  from
           current customers  with  minimal additional  sales  and  marketing
           expenses

          expand  our  customer  base    we  seek  to  establish  longterm
           relationships with new customers  through our sales and  marketing
           efforts and selected acquisitions   as of june  30 2002 we  had

           retaining highquality  employees is  essential to  our  continued
           growth and success  our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees a  strategy we  believe has  resulted in  low  employee
           turnover  in addition we selectively use employee stock  options
           to serve as a strong incentive and retention tool

 development staff and  because our product  development is highly  customer
 driven  through our regular contact with customers at user group  meetings
 sales contacts and through our  ongoing maintenance services our  customers

 sales and marketing

 our primary markets consist of commercial banks and credit unions  we  have
 not devoted  significant  marketing and  sales  efforts to  other  financial
 institutions such  as thrifts   historically  we have  primarily and  most
 successfully marketed to banks with up to 100  billion in total assets and
 credit unions of all sizes

 our sales efforts are conducted by a dedicated field sales force an  inside
 sales team and a technical sales support team all of which are overseen  by
 regional sales managers  our dedicated field sales force is responsible for
 pursuing lead generation  activities and  representing the  majority of  our
 products and solutions to current and prospective clients  our inside sales
 force sells certain complementary products to  our existing customers   all

 advertisement  placements  internally   developed  and  managed   marketing
 campaigns   we also  conduct a  number  of field  and national  user  group
 meetings each  year  which enable  us  to keep  in  close contact  with  our
 customers and demonstrate new products and services to them

 efforts  of   our  whollyowned   foreign  sales   subsidiary  jack   henry
 international limited  our international sales have historically  accounted
 for less than 1 of our revenues

 delivery  and  the  minimum  amounts  due  on  the  remaining  portion   of
 outsourcing  contracts  which  are typically  for  fiveyear  periods  our
 backlog at  june  30 2002  was  528  million for  inhouse  products  and
 services and 889 million for outsourcing services with a total backlog of
 1417  million  of  the  889  amount  of  the  backlog  for  outsourcing
 service at  june 30  2002 586  is not  expected to  be realized  in  our
 current fiscal year due to the  longterm nature of many of our  outsourcing
 service contracts  backlog at june 30 2001 was 495 million for  inhouse
 products and services  and 776 million  for outsourcing  services with  a
 total  backlog  of  1271 million  our  backlog  is  subject  to  seasonal
 variations and can  fluctuate quarterly  due to  various factors  including
 slower contract processing rates during the summer months

 competition

 the  market  for  companies  providing  technology  solutions  to  financial
 institutions  is  competitive  and  fragmented  and  we  expect   continued
 competition from  both  existing  competitors  and  companies  entering  our
 existing or future  markets  some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial  resources
 the  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications features and  functionality
 flexibility and  ease of  use customer  support references  from  existing
 customers and price  we compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing products and services to financial institutions including bisys
 inc alltel  information  services  inc fiserv  inc  electronic  data
 systems corporation and marshall and ilsley  corporation  in addition  we
 compete with  a number  of  providers that  offer  one or  more  specialized
 products  or  services  there  has  been  significant  consolidation  among
 providers of  information  technology  products and  services  to  financial
 institutions and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks

 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology  we have registered
 or filed applications for our primary trademarks  none of our technology is
 patented  instead  we  rely on  a  combination of  contractual rights  and
 copyrights trademarks  and  trade  secrets to  establish  and  protect  our
 proprietary technology  we generally enter into confidentiality  agreements
 with  our  employees  consultants   resellers  customers  and   potential
 customers  we restrict  access to and distribution  of our source code  and
 further limit  the disclosure  and use  of  other  proprietary  information
 despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized  parties
 may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products  or  technology
 we cannot be sure the steps taken by us  in this regard will be adequate  to
 prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will  not
 independently develop technologies are substantially equivalent or  superior
 to our technology

 of financial  institutions  such  as  communityregional  banks  and  credit

 products and services conform to their regulatory needs  it is not possible

 through centurion disaster recovery  as  a service  provider  to  financial
 institutions  our   operations  are   governed  by   the  same   regulatory
 requirements as those imposed on financial institutions  we are subject  to
 periodic review by federal depository institution regulators who have  broad
 supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews

 employees

 as of june 30  2002 and 2001 we  had 2093 and  1910 full time  employees
 respectively   our employees  are not  covered by  a collective  bargaining
 agreement and there have been no laborrelated work stoppages  we  consider
 our relationship with our employees to be good

                                 risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond their  control
 the  following is a  description of some of  the important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired

 changes  within  the banking industry could  reduce demand for our products
 in the current  environment of  low interest  rates the  profit margins  of
 commercial  banks  and credit  unions  have  narrowed  as the  economy  has
 stumbled loan demand has slackened and loan defaults have increased  as  a
 result many banks have slowed or stopped their capital spending  including
 spending on  computer software  and hardware  affecting both  sales to  new
 customers and upgradecomplimentary product sales to existing customers

 we may not be able to continue or  effectively manage our rapid growth   we
 have grown at a rapid pace  both internally and through acquisitions   our
 expansion has  and  will  continue  to  place  significant  demands  on  our
 administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems
 we  cannot assure you that we will be able to enhance and expand our product
 lines manage  costs adapt  our infrastructure  and modify  our systems  to
 accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology  we
 could lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business   the
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes   these  factors and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services   if we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services we may incur
 unanticipated expenses lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 acquisitions may be  costly and difficult  to integrate   we have  acquired
 several  businesses  and   will  continue  to   explore  possible   business
 combinations in the future   we may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired companies   we  may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services  diversion  of  managements
 attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets  without additional acquisitions
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to meet  competitive challenges   if  our
 integration strategies fail our  business financial condition and  results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 if  our  strategic  relationship  with  ibm were  terminated it  could have
 a  negative impact on  the  continuing  success  of our  business  we  have
 developed a strategic relationship with ibm  as part of this  collaborative
 relationship we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  industry  remarketer  agreement  and  resell  maintenance  on  ibm
 hardware products to our customers  much of our software is designed to  be
 compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers
 if  ibm   were   to  terminate   or  fundamentally   modify  our   strategic
 relationship our  relationship  with our  customers  and our  revenues  and
 earnings would  suffer   we could  also lose  software market  share or  be
 required to redesign existing products or develop new products that would be
 compatible with the hardware used by our customers

 competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services  we expect  competition in the markets we serve  will
 remain vigorous  we compete on  the basis of product quality  reliability
 performance ease  of  use quality  of  support  and  pricing   we  cannot
 guarantee that we  will be able  to compete successfully  with our  existing
 competitors or with companies entering our  markets in the future   certain
 of our  competitors  have  strong  financial  marketing  and  technological
 resources and in some cases a larger customer  base than we do  they  may
 be able to adapt more quickly to  new or emerging technologies or to  devote
 greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management  our  company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated in a small  number of key employees  if  we
 lose one or more of our key employees we  could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss  we do not  have
 employment agreements  with  any  of our  executive  officers  however  we
 currently have a management succession plan in place and are naming specific
 managers successors

 consolidation of  financial  institutions could  reduce  the number  of  our
 customers  and  potential  customers   our   primary  market  consists   of
 approximately 8600 commercial banks and 10200  credit unions  the  number
 of commercial banks and credit unions  has decreased as a result of  mergers
 and acquisitions over  the last five  years and is  expected to continue  to
 decrease as  more consolidation  occurs which  will  reduce our  number  of
 potential  customers   as a  result  of  this consolidation  some  of  our
 existing customers could terminate or refuse to renew their contracts  with
 us and potential customers could break off negotiations with us

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that  could  hinder our  ability  to  develop   portions  of  our
 business or  impose  additional  constraints  on  the  way  we  conduct  our
 operations  the  financial services industry  is subject  to extensive  and
 complex federal  and  state  regulation   as  a  supplier  of  services  to
 financial institutions some of our operations are examined by the office of
 the comptroller of the currency the  federal reserve board and the  federal
 deposit insurance  corporation  among  other  regulatory  agencies   these
 agencies regulate services we  provide and the manner  in which we  operate
 and we are  required to comply  with a broad  range of  applicable laws  and
 regulations  in addition existing laws regulations and policies could  be
 amended or interpreted  differently by  regulators in  a manner  that has  a
 negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future  growth
 or expansion  our customers are  also regulated entities and the form  and
 content of  actions  by  regulatory authorities  could  determine  both  the
 decisions they make  concerning the purchase  of data  processing and  other
 services  and  the  timing  and  implementation  of  these  decisions   the
 development of financial services over the internet has raised concerns with
 respect to  the  use  confidentiality  and  security  of  private  customer
 information   regulatory  agencies  congress and  state  legislatures  are
 considering numerous  regulatory  and  statutory proposals  to  protect  the
 interests of  consumers  and to  require  compliance by  the  industry  with
 standards and policies that have not been defined

 network or  internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business  we rely on standard  network and internet security systems  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data   computer
 networks and the  internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems  in  addition advances in  computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers  security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products  we may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches   eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions delays or cessation of service  to users any of which  could
 harm our business

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease   computer   hardware  technology  is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities  could  cause  us
 to lose customers  damage  or destruction that interrupts  our provision of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment  although we  have installed backup systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services  in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption  in addition a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us

 item 7   managements discussion and  analysis of financial  condition  and
 results of operations

      the following discussion  and analysis  should be  read in  conjunction
 with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements
 and related notes included elsewhere in this report


 overview

 we provide  integrated computer  systems for  inhouse and  outsourced  data
 processing to commercial  banks with under  100 billion  in total  assets
 credit unions  and  other  financial institutions  we  have  developed  and
 acquired banking  and  credit union  application  software systems  that  we
 market  together   with   compatible  computer   hardware   to   financial
 institutions throughout the united states  we also perform data  conversion
 and software installation for the implementation of our systems and  provide
 continuing customer maintenance and support  services after the systems  are
 installed for our customers who prefer  not to make an upfront  investment
 in software and hardware we provide our full range of products and services
 on an outsourced  basis through  our eight  data centers  and fourteen  item
 processing centers located across the united states

 we derive revenues from four primary sources

     sales of software licenses and installation services

     support and service fees

     hardware sales and

     customer reimbursements

 over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 1563 million
 in fiscal 1998  to 3967  million in  fiscal 2002  income from  continuing
 operations has grown from 242 million  in fiscal 1998 to 571 million  in
 fiscal 2002  this growth  has resulted  primarily from  internal  expansion
 supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing  us to develop and  acquire
 new products and  services and expand  the number of  customers who use  our
 core software systems to approximately 2400 as of june 30 2002

 since  july  1997  we  have  completed   12  acquisitions  ten  of   these
 acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and
 our consolidated financial statements include  the results of operations  of
 the acquired companies from the dates of their respective acquisitions  the
 remaining two acquisitions were accounted for as poolingsofinterests  the
 comparisons set forth below reflect the fact that the consolidated financial
 statements include all acquisitions  accounted for as  poolingsofinterests
 as if each had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period reported

 software  sales  and   installation  revenue  includes   the  licensing   of
 application software systems  and the conversion  and installation  services
 contracted with us  by the customer   we license  our proprietary  software
 products under  standard  license  agreements which  typically  provide  the
 customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on
 a single  computer and  for a  single  financial institution  location  upon
 payment of  the license  fee generally  25  to 50  of license  fees  are
 payable upon execution of the license agreement with additional payments due
 upon either  delivery  of the  software  or  the installation  of  the  last
 application module  we  recognize 100  of  software license  revenue  upon
 delivery of  the  software  and  documentation  we  recognize  installation
 services each month as services are performed under hourly contracts and  at
 the completion of the installations under fixed fee contracts

 support and services fees are generated from ongoing services to assist  the
 customer in operating the systems and to modify and update the software  and
 from providing outsourced data  processing services revenues from  software
 support are  generated  pursuant to  annual  agreements and  are  recognized
 ratably over the life of the agreements outsourcing services are  performed
 through data centers revenues from  outsourced data processing are  derived
 from monthly usage fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our
 customers we recognize  the revenues under  these outsourcing contracts  as
 services are performed

 customer  reimbursements  represent  direct  costs  paid  to  third  parties
 primarily for data communication postage and travel  we recognize customer
 reimbursements as revenue and as a pass through expense as incurred

 cost  of   services  represents   costs  associated   with  conversion   and
 installation efforts ongoing support for our inhouse customers  operation
 of our data  centers providing services  for our  outsourced customers  and
 direct operation costs these costs are recognized as they are incurred

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our customers along with  our inhouse banking  software systems   revenues
 from hardware sales are recognized when the manufacturers ship the  hardware
 directly to our customers cost of hardware consists of the direct costs  of
 purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers these costs are  recognized
 at the same time as the related revenue

 we have two business  segments bank systems and  services and credit  union
 systems and services  the respective segments include all related software
 installation  support   and   service   hardware   sales   and   customer
 reimbursement revenue  along with  related cost  of services  hardware  and

 adopting sfas no 142 and the overall cost control measures put in place  by
 management   the  slight  increases which  are  significantly  lower  than
 historical levels are  primarily due to  the industry trend  of an  overall
 decrease in capital spending  for the year which  was impacted by  september
 11th and reduced growth for fy2002

 increase for the year  ended june 30 2002   despite the sluggish  economy
 the credit union  segment was  able to maintain  growth in  revenue   gross

 the overall cost control measures put in place by management

 million in fiscal 2000 to 1381 million or 44 increase for the year ended

 critical accounting policies

 we  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance   with
 accounting  principles  generally  accepted   in  the  united  states   the
 significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the  consolidated
 financial statements   certain of  these accounting  policies as  discussed
 below require  management to  make estimates  and assumptions  about  future
 events  that  could  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses and  disclosure of contingent assets  and
 liabilities  actual results may differ from these estimates under different
 assumptions or conditions

 we record  revenue in  accordance with  statement  of position  sop  972
 software revenue recognition as amended   we recognize revenue from  sales
 of hardware software and services and from arrangements involving  multiple
 elements of each of  the above  revenue  for multiple element  arrangements
 are recorded based on contractual amounts  which are determined based  upon
 the price charged  when sold separately   revenue is  not recognized  until
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee
 is  fixed  and  determinable  and collectibility  is  probable   sales  of
 hardware  and equipment  are recorded when title and risk of loss transfers
 licensing  revenues  are  recorded  upon  delivery  and  acceptance  of  the
 software  service fees for training and installation are recognized  as the
 services are  provided   support  revenues  are recorded  evenly  over  the
 related contract period

 we  maintain  an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  for  estimated  losses
 resulting from the inability  of our customers to  make  required  payments
 the amount of our reserve is based on historical experience and our analysis
 of the accounts receivable balance outstanding  if the financial  condition
 of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to  make
 payments additional allowances  may be required  which would  result in  an
 additional expense in the  period such determination was  made  while  such
 credit losses  have  historically  been  within  our  expectations  and  the
 provisions established  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we  will  continue  to
 experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past

 the calculation of  depreciation and amortization  expense is  based on  the
 estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and
 intangibles  we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to  the
 useful lives of its  tangible and intangible assets  will occur in the  near
 term rapid  changes in  technology or  changes in  market conditions  could
 result in  revisions to  such estimates  that  could materially  affect  the
 carrying value  of  these  assets  and  the  companys  future  consolidated
 operating results

 item 1   business

 jack henry  associates inc jha or the company is a leading provider
 of integrated computer systems  to banks with under  100 billion of  total
 assets credit unions and other financial institutions in the united states
 we offer  a complete integrated suite  of data processing system  solutions
 to improve  our  customers  management  of  their  entire  backoffice  and
 customer  interaction  processes   we  believe  our  solutions  enable  our
 customers to  provide better  service to  their customers  and compete  more
 effectively  against larger  banks  and alternative  financial institutions
 our customers either install and use our systems inhouse or outsource these
 operations to  us    we perform  data  conversion  hardware  and  software
 installation and  software  customization  for  the  implementation  of  our
 systems  and  applications  we  also  provide continuing  customer  support
 services  to  ensure  proper  product  performance  and  reliability  which
 provides us with  continuing  client  relationships  and  recurring revenue
 for  our customers  who  prefer  not to  acquire  hardware  and software we
 provide  outsourcing  services  through  eight  data  centers  and  14  item
 processing centers located across the united states

 our  gross  revenue has grown  from 1263 million in  fiscal 1997 to 3455
 million in fiscal 2001 representing a compound annual growth rate over this
 fiveyear period of 296  net income from continuing operations has  grown
 from 185  million  in fiscal  1997  to 556  million  in fiscal  2001  a
 compound annual growth rate of 32

 industry background
 according  to  the  automation  in   banking  2001  report  all   financial
 institutions including commercial banks thrifts and credit unions  in  the
 united states  increased  spending  on  hardware  software  services  and
 telecommunications to  383 billion  in 2000  from 272  billion in  1996
 representing a compound  annual growth rate  of 114   an industry  survey
 shows that 93 of financial institutions believe upgrading technology is the
 most important issue to their continued success  we believe that the market
 opportunity for  providers of  hardware and  software systems  maintenance
 support and related outsourcing services targeted toward community banks and
 credit unions will continue to grow as a result of the competitive  pressure
 on financial institutions

 there are approximately 8300 commercial banks  and 10500 credit unions  in
 the united  states   our primary  market has  historically been  commercial
 banks  with  less  than  100  billion  in  assets  of  which  there  were
 approximately 8200 at december 31 2000   as of december 31 2000   banks
 with under 100  billion in assets  had aggregate  assets of  approximately
 19 trillion   consolidation within  the financial  services industry  has
 resulted in a 37  compound annual decline in  the population of  community
 banks and a 14 compound annual  decline in their aggregate assets  between
 1995 and 2000 we also serve credit unions in the united states  these  are
 cooperative notforprofit  financial  institutions  organized  to  promote
 savings and provide  credit to their  members  as  of   december 31  2000
 there  were  10538  federally insured credit  unions in the  united states
 although the number of these credit  unions has declined at a 26  compound
 annual rate between 1995 and 2000 their aggregate assets have increased  at
 a 73 compound annual rate to 4498 billion in 2000

 we believe that communityregional banks and credit unions play an important
 role with  the geographic  and demographic  communities and  customers  they
 serve  typically customers of these banks and credit unions rely on  these
 financial institutions  because of  their ability  to provide  personalized
 relationshipbased service and their focus  on local community and  business
 needs  we believe these core strengths will allow communityregional  banks
 and credit unions to effectively compete  with larger banks and  alternative
 financial institutions  in order to succeed and to maintain strong customer
 relationships we believe these banks and credit unions must continue to

          focus on their primary products and services

          respond rapidly to customer demand for new products and services

          implement advanced  technologies  such as  imaging  and  internet
           banking

          use advanced  technologies in  backoffice operations  to  improve
           operating efficiency and  control costs  while increasing  service
           and lowering costs to their customers and

          integrate products and services into their core service  offerings
           and data processing infrastructure to provide the same wide range
           of services as are offered by larger banks


 in 2000 approximately  59 of commercial  banks utilized inhouse  hardware
 and software  systems  to  perform  all  of  their  core  systems  and  data
 processing functions   offsite  data processing  centers provided  systems
 services on an outsourced basis for the  remaining 41 of banks  since  the
 mid1980s banks have tended to shift their data processing requirements in
 house from outsourcing such functions to  thirdparty data centers  of  the
 community  banks  in   the  united  states   with  inhouse   installations
 approximately 53  21  and  7 utilize  ibm  unisys  and  ncr  hardware
 respectively  no other specific hardware platform had more than a 5  share
 of the market

 the internet continues to  become a more powerful  and efficient medium  for
 the  delivery  of  financial  services  including  internet  banking  bill
 payment bill  presentment  and other  services  for individuals  and  cash
 management and  other services  for the  commercial customers  of  financial
 institutions  financial institutions provide internet banking solutions  to
 retain customers attract  new customers reduce  operating costs and  gain
 noninterest  sources   of  revenue     according   to  industry   sources
 approximately 30 of  banks in the united states offer internet banking  we
 believe that communityregional financial institutions risk losing customers
 to larger  or  alternative  financial institutions  if  they  do  not  offer
 competitive internet banking services

          rapidly deploy  new  products  and services    once  a  financial

           products and services as well as provide additional services  such
           as network services and computer facilities design

          expand our existing customer relationships   we seek to  increase
           the information  technology products  and services  we provide  to
           those customers that do not utilize our full range of products and
           services  in  this way  we are  able to  increase revenues  from
           current customers  with  minimal additional  sales  and  marketing
           expenses

          expand  our  customer  base    we  seek  to  establish  longterm
           relationships with new customers  through our sales and  marketing
           efforts and selected acquisitions   as of june  30 2001 we  had
           over 2800 customers up from 1240 in 1996

          build recurring revenue  we  enter into contracts with  customers

           and retaining highquality employees is essential to our continued
           growth and success  our corporate culture focuses on the needs of
           employees a strategy that we believe has resulted in low employee
           turnover  in addition we selectively use employee stock  options
           to serve as a strong incentive and retention tool

 our acquisitions

 companies that provide us with one or more of the following

          new customers

 other services

 we also  offer  our full  suite  of software  products  and services  on  an
 outsourced basis to customers  who do not wish  to maintain update and  run
 these systems or to  make large upfront  capital expenditures to  implement
 these advanced  technologies   our  principal  outsourcing service  is  the
 delivery of missioncritical data processing services using our data centers

 through an extensive national data and service center network comprised  of
 eight data centers and 14 item processing centers  we monitor and  maintain
 our network on a sevenday  24hour basis  customers typically pay monthly

 hardware systems
 our software operates  on a variety  of hardware systems   we have  entered
 into remarketing agreements with ibm ncr and other hardware providers  that
 allow us to purchase hardware  at a discount and  sell remarket it to  our
 customers together with our  software applications   we currently sell  the
 ibm as400  which  is ibms  premier  midrange hardware  system  the  ibm
 rs6000 ncr servers and  readersorters banctec readersorters and  unisys

 we have a longterm strategic relationship  with ibm dating to the  initial
 design of our first core software applications  more than 20 years  ago  in
 addition to our remarketing agreement with ibm which we renew  annually we
 have  been  named  a  premier business partner  of ibm  for the  last nine
 consecutive years  our relationship with ibm provides us with a substantial
 and ongoing source of revenue

 readersorter hardware products to  allow us to  respond to customer  demand
 for alternative hardware products and sell our complementary image  software
 applications to a broaderbased market

 core software applications
 each of  our  core software  systems  consists of  several  fullyintegrated
 application modules  such  as  deposits loans  general  ledger  and  the
 customer information file which is  a centralized file containing  customer
 data for all  applications  we  can customtailor  these modules  utilizing
 parameters determined by our customer the applications can be connected  to
 a wide variety of peripheral hardware devices used in bank operations   our
 software  is  designed  to  provide  maximum  flexibility  in  meeting   our
 customers data processing requirements within  a single system to  minimize
 data entry and improve efficiencies

 for our customers who choose to acquire inhouse capabilities we  generally
 license our core system under standard license agreements which provide  the
 customer with a fullypaid nonexclusive  nontransferable right to use  the
 software on a single computer and at a single location  these same  systems
 can be delivered on an outsourced basis as well

 our core  software  applications  are  differentiated  broadly  by  size  of
 customer  scalability  customizable  functionality  customer  competitive
 environment and to a lesser extent cost  our core applications include

 customers contract  with  us  for  installation  and  training  services  in
 connection  with  their  purchase  of   inhouse  systems    the   complete
 installation process of a core  system typically includes planning  design
 data conversion hardware setup  and testing  at  the culmination of  this
 installation  process  one  of  our  installation  teams  travels  to   our
 customers facilities  to ensure  the smooth  transfer of  data to  the  new
 system  installation fees are charged separately to our customers on either
 a fixed fee or hourly charge model depending on the system with full  pass
 through to  our  customers  of travel  and  other  expenses    installation
 services are also required in connection with new outsourcing customers and
 are billed separately at the time of installation

 both in connection with installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis
 our customers need and we provide extensive training services and programs
 related to  our products  and services   training  can be  provided in  our
 regional training  centers at  meetings and  conferences or  onsite at  our
 customers  locations  and  can  be  customized  to  meet  our   customers
 requirements  the large majority of our customers acquire training services
 from us both to improve their  employees proficiency and productivity  and
 to make full use of the  functionality of our systems  generally  training
 services are paid  for on an  hourly basis however  we have recently  been
 successful  in  marketing  annual   subscriptions  for  training   services
 representing blocks of training time that can be used by our customers in  a
 flexible fashion and the related revenue  is recognized as the services  are
 provided

 support and services
 following the  installation  of  our hardware  and  software  systems  at  a
 customer site we provide  ongoing software support  services to assist  our
 customers in operating the systems and to periodically update the  software
 we  also offer support services for hardware primarily through our hardware
 suppliers providing customers  who have  contracted for  this service  with
 onecall system support covering hardware and software applications

 remotely   we maintain  our customers  software largely  through  releases
 which contain  improvements and  incremental additions   updates  also  are
 issued when required  by changes  in applicable  laws and  regulations   we
 provide maintenance and support services on our core systems as well as  our
 complementary software products

 nearly  all  of  our inhouse customers  purchase support services  from us
 these services are a significant source of recurring revenue are contracted
 for on an annual basis and are typically priced at approximately 18 of  the
 particular software products license fee   these fees may be increased  as
 our customers  asset base  increases  and as  they  increase the  level  of
 functionality  of  their  system  by  purchasing  additional   complementary
 products   software support  fees are  generally paid  in advance  for  the
 entire  year  with proration for new contracts which start during the year
 hardware support  fees are  also paid  in advance  for the  entire  contract
 period which ranges from  one to five years   most contracts  automatically
 renew annually unless  we or  our customer  gives notice  of termination  at

      customized information  and ecommerce  opportunities including  user
      defined content  such as  local or  special interest  events  weather
      financial news and other information


 research and development
 we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software and service
 products  and  continually  upgrade  and  enhance  our  existing  offerings
 typically we  upgrade  our  core software  applications  and  complementary
 services once  per year    we believe  that  our research  and  development
 efforts are  highly efficient  because of  the extensive  experience of  our
 research and development staff and because our product development is highly
 customerdriven  through our regular contact  with customers at user  group
 meetings sales contacts and through  our ongoing maintenance services  our
 customers inform us of the new products and functionalities they desire

 sales and marketing
 our primary markets consist of commercial banks and credit unions  we  have
 not devoted  significant  marketing and  sales  efforts to  other  financial
 institutions such  as thrifts   historically  we have  primarily and  most
 successfully marketed to banks with up  to 50 billion in total assets  and
 credit unions of all sizes

 our sales efforts are conducted by a dedicated field sales force an  inside
 sales team and a technical sales support team all of which are overseen  by
 regional sales managers  our dedicated field sales force is responsible for
 pursuing lead generation  activities and  representing the  majority of  our
 products and solutions to current and prospective clients  our inside sales
 force sells certain complementary products to  our  existing customers  all
 sales force personnel  have responsibility  for a specific  territory   the
 sales support  team writes  business proposals  and contracts  and  prepares
 responses to  requestforproposals  regarding  our  software  and  hardware
 solutions   all  of our  sales  professionals  receive a  base  salary  and
 performancebased commission compensation

 our marketing effort consists  of attendance at  trade shows printed  media
 advertisement  placements  internally   developed  and  managed   marketing
 campaigns   we also  conduct a  number  of field  and national  user  group
 meetings each  year  that  enable us  to  keep  in close  contact  with  our
 customers and demonstrate new products and services to them

 we have 24 installations  in the caribbean  primarily through the  marketing
 efforts  of   our  whollyowned   foreign  sales   subsidiary  jack   henry
 international limited  our international sales have historically  accounted
 for less than 1 of our revenues

 backlog
 our backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services prior  to
 delivery  and  the  minimum  amounts  due  on  the  remaining  portion   of
 outsourcing contracts  which  are typically  for  fiveyear periods    our
 backlog at  june 30  2001 was  495   million  for inhouse  products  and
 services and 776 million for outsourcing services with a total backlog of
 1271  million  backlog  at june 30 2000  was 430 million for  inhouse
 products and services  and 614 million  for outsourcing  services with  a
 total backlog  of  1044 million    our  backlog is  subject  to  seasonal
 variations and can  fluctuate quarterly  due to  various factors  including
 slower contract processing rates during the summer months

 competition
 the market  for companies  that provide  technology solutions  to  financial
 institutions  is  competitive  and  fragmented  and  we  expect   continued
 competition from  both existing  competitors and  companies that  enter  our
 existing or future  markets  some  of our current  competitors have  longer
 operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial  resources
 the  principal competitive  factors affecting  the market  for our  services
 include comprehensiveness of the  applications features and  functionality
 flexibility and  ease of  use customer  support references  from  existing
 customers and price  we compete  with large vendors that offer  transaction
 processing products and services to financial institutions including bisys
 inc alltel  information services  fiserv inc  and marshall  and  ilsley
 corporation  in addition we compete with a number of providers that  offer
 one or more specialized  products or services   there has been  significant
 consolidation  among  providers  of  information  technology  products   and
 services to financial institutions and  we believe this consolidation  will
 continue in the future

 intellectual property patents and trademarks
 although we believe that  our success depends  upon our technical  expertise
 more than  on our  proprietary rights  our future  success and  ability  to
 compete depends in part  upon our proprietary technology   we have  already
 registered or filed applications  for our primary trademarks   none of  our
 technology is patented   instead we rely on  a combination of  contractual
 rights and copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect
 our  proprietary  technology    we  generally  enter  into  confidentiality
 agreements  with  our  employees  consultants  resellers  customers   and
 potential customers  we restrict access  to and distribution of our  source
 code  and  further  limit  the  disclosure  and  use  of  other  proprietary
 information   despite  our  efforts  to  protect  our  proprietary  rights
 unauthorized parties may  attempt to  copy or  otherwise obtain  or use  our
 products or technology   we cannot be sure  that the steps  taken by us  in
 this regard will be adequate to  prevent misappropriation of our  technology
 or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are
 substantially equivalent or superior to our technology


 government regulation
 the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex  federal
 and state regulation  our current and prospective customers which  consist
 of financial  institutions  such  as  communityregional  banks  and  credit
 unions operate  in  markets  that are  subject  to  substantial  regulatory
 oversight and supervision   we must ensure that  our products and  services
 work within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to
 our customers including those under the federal truthinlending and truth
 indeposit rules usury  laws the equal  credit opportunity  act the  fair
 housing act the electronic  funds transfer act  the fair credit  reporting
 act the  bank  secrecy  act  and  the  community  reinvestment  act    the
 compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a
 variety of factors including  the particular functionality the  interactive
 design and the classification of customers   our customers must assess  and
 determine what is required of them under these regulations and they contract
 with us to ensure that our products and services conform to their regulatory
 needs   it  is  not possible  to  predict  the impact  that  any  of  these
 regulations could have on our business in the future

 we are not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board
 of governors  of  the federal  reserve  system the  national  credit  union
 administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise
 depository institutions  the services provided by our outlink data  centers
 are subject to examination by the federal depository institution  regulators
 under the bank  service company act   on occasion  these services are  also
 subject to examination by state banking authorities

 we provide outsourced  data and item  processing through our  geographically
 dispersed outlink data  centers electronic  transaction processing  through
 commlink atm and transaction processing solutions internet banking  through
 netteller online  banking  and  bank  business  recovery  services  through
 centurion  disaster  recovery     as  a   service  provider  to   financial
 institutions  our   operations  are   governed  by   the  same   regulatory
 requirements as those imposed on financial institutions  we are subject  to
 periodic review by federal depository institution regulators who have  broad
 supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews

 the privacy  requirements in  title v  of the  grammleachbliley act  the
 act adopted in november  of 1999 represent a  significant change in  the
 federal legal framework  governing how  providers of  financial services  in
 this  country  interact  with  their  customers   regulations  implementing
 title v  established  standards  for  financial  institutions  relating   to
 administrative technical and physical  safeguards for customer records  and
 information  financial institutions are required to evaluate their controls
 on access to customer information and their policies for encrypting customer
 information while it  is being transmitted  or stored on  networks to  which
 unauthorized persons may have access   as a software company that  provides
 services to financial institutions we  are covered under these  regulations
 and may have to  adopt additional safeguards within  our software to  ensure
 that we and our customers are in compliance with the act

 employees
 as of june  30 2001 and 2000  we had 1910 and 1589  full time  employees
 respectively    our employees are  not covered by  a collective  bargaining
 agreement and there have been no laborrelated work stoppages  we  consider
 our relationship with our employees to be good


                                 risk factors

 the companys business  and the results  of its operations  are affected  by
 numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond their  control
 the  following is a  description of some of  the important risk factors  and
 uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys  operations
 in future  periods to  differ materially  from those  currently expected  or
 desired

 we  may not be able to continue or  effectively manage our rapid growth  we
 have  grown at a rapid pace  both internally and through acquisitions  our
 expansion has  and  will  continue  to  place  significant  demands  on  our
 administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems
 we  cannot assure you that we will be able to enhance and expand our product
 lines manage  costs adapt  our infrastructure  and modify  our systems  to
 accommodate future growth

 if we fail to adapt our products  and services to changes in technology  we
 could lose existing customers  and be unable to  attract new business   the
 markets  for  our   software  and   hardware  products   and  services   are
 characterized by  changing  customer requirements  and  rapid  technological
 changes   these  factors and  new  product introductions  by  our  existing
 competitors or  by new  market  entrants could  reduce  the demand  for  our
 existing products and services and we may be required to develop or  acquire
 new products and services  our  future success is dependent on our  ability
 to enhance our  existing products  and services in  a timely  manner and  to
 develop or acquire new products and services   if we are unable to  develop
 or acquire new products and services  as planned or fail to achieve  timely
 market acceptance of our new or enhanced products and services we may incur
 unanticipated expenses lose sales or fail to achieve anticipated revenues

 acquisitions may be  costly and difficult  to integrate   we have  acquired
 several  businesses  and   will  continue  to   explore  possible   business
 combinations in the future   we may not  be able to successfully  integrate
 acquired companies    we may  encounter  problems in  connection  with  the
 integration of  new businesses  including  financial control  and  computer
 system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer
 problems with  acquired  products  or services  diversion  of  managements
 attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization  expenses
 related to identifiable intangible assets  without additional acquisitions
 we may not  be able  to grow and  to develop  new products  and services  as
 quickly as we  have in  the past  to meet  competitive challenges   if  our
 integration strategies fail our  business financial condition and  results
 of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 if our strategic  relationship with  ibm were  terminated it  could have  a
 negative impact  on  the  continuing  success of  our  business    we  have
 developed a strategic relationship with ibm  as part of this  collaborative
 relationship we market and sell ibm hardware and equipment to our customers
 under an  industry  remarketer  agreement  and  resell  maintenance  on  ibm
 hardware products to our customers  much of our software is designed to  be
 compatible with the ibm hardware that is run by a majority of our customers
 if ibm were to terminate or fundamentally modify our strategic relationship
 our relationship  with our  customers and  our revenues  and earnings  would
 suffer  we could also lose software market share or be required to redesign
 existing products or develop new products that would be compatible with  the
 hardware used by our customers

 competition may  result in  price reductions  and decreased  demand for  our
 products and services  we expect  that competition in the markets we  serve
 will  remain  vigorous   we  compete  on  the  basis  of  product  quality
 reliability performance ease of use quality  of support and pricing   we
 cannot guarantee  that we  will be  able to  compete successfully  with  our
 existing competitors or  with companies that  may enter our  markets in  the
 future  certain  of our competitors  have strong  financial marketing  and
 technological resources and in some cases  a larger customer base than  we
 do  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging  technologies
 or to devote greater resources to  the promotion and sale of their  products
 and services

 the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business  we depend to
 a significant  extent  on the  contributions  and abilities  of  our  senior
 management  our  company has grown  significantly in recent  years and  our
 management remains concentrated in a small  number of key employees  if  we
 lose one or more of our key employees we  could suffer a loss of sales  and
 delays in new product development and management resources would have to be
 diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss  we do not  have
 employment agreements  with  any  of our  executive  officers  however  we
 currently have a management succession plan in place and are naming specific
 managers successors

 consolidation of  financial  institutions could  reduce  the number  of  our
 customers   and  potential  customers   our  primary  market  consists   of
 approximately 8300 commercial banks and 10500  credit unions  the  number
 of commercial banks and credit unions  has decreased as a result of  mergers
 and  acquisitions  and  is  expected  to   continue  to  decrease  as   more
 consolidation  occurs which  will reduce our number of potential customers
 as a result  of this  consolidation some  of our  existing customers  could
 terminate or  refuse  to  renew  their  contracts  with  us  and  potential
 customers could break off negotiations with us

 the  services  we  provide  to  our  customers  are  subject  to  government
 regulation that could hinder our ability to develop portions of our business
 or impose additional constraints on the way we conduct our operations   the
 financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal  and
 state regulation  as a supplier of services to financial institutions some
 of our  operations are  examined by  the office  of the  comptroller of  the
 currency the  federal  reserve  board and  the  federal  deposit  insurance
 corporation among  other  regulatory  agencies   these  agencies  regulate
 services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are  required
 to  comply  with  a broad  range  of applicable  laws  and regulations   in
 addition  existing  laws  regulations  and policies  could  be  amended or
 interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that has a negative impact
 on our existing operations  or  that  limits our future growth or expansion
 our customers  are also  regulated entities  and the  form and  content  of
 actions by regulatory  authorities could determine  both the decisions  they
 make concerning the purchase of data  processing and other services and  the
 timing and implementation of these decisions  the development of  financial
 services over the  internet has  raised concerns  with respect  to the  use
 confidentiality and security  of private customer  information   regulatory
 agencies  congress  and   state  legislatures   are  considering   numerous
 regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and
 to require compliance by the industry with standards and policies that  have
 not been defined

 network or  internet  security  problems could  damage  our  reputation  and
 business  we rely on standard  network and internet security systems  most
 of which  we  license  from  third parties  to  provide  the  security  and
 authentication necessary to  effect secure transmission  of data   computer
 networks and the  internet are vulnerable  to unauthorized access  computer
 viruses and other disruptive  problems  in  addition advances in  computer
 capabilities new discoveries in the field  of cryptography or other  events
 or developments may render our security measures inadequate  someone who is
 able  to  circumvent  security  measures  could  misappropriate  proprietary
 information or  cause  interruptions  in our  operations  or  those  of  our
 customers  security risks may result in liability to us and also may  deter
 financial institutions from purchasing our products  we may need to  expend
 significant capital  or other  resources protecting  against the  threat  of
 security breaches or alleviating problems  caused by breaches   eliminating
 computer viruses  and  alleviating other  security  problems may  result  in
 interruptions delays or cessation of service  to users any of which  could
 harm our business

 as technology becomes less expensive and  more advanced purchase prices  of
 hardware  may  decline  and  our  revenues  and  profits  from   remarketing
 arrangements  may  decrease    computer  hardware  technology  is   rapidly
 developing  hardware  manufacturers are producing  less expensive and  more
 powerful equipment each year and we expect this trend to continue into  the
 future  as computer hardware becomes  less expensive revenues and  profits
 derived from  our hardware  remarketing may  decrease and  become a  smaller
 portion of our revenues and profits

 an  operational  failure  in  our  outsourcing  facilities could cause us to
 lose  customers  damage or destruction  that interrupts  our  provision  of
 outsourcing services could  damage our relationship  with certain  customers
 and may  cause us  to  incur substantial  additional  expense to  repair  or
 replace damaged equipment  although we  have installed backup systems  and
 procedures to prevent  or reduce disruption  we cannot assure  you that  we
 will not  suffer  a prolonged  interruption  of our  transaction  processing
 services  in the event that an interruption of our network extends for more
 than several hours we may experience  data loss or a reduction in  revenues
 by reason of such interruption  in addition a significant interruption  of
 service could have a  negative impact on our  reputation and could lead  our
 present and potential customers to choose service providers other than us

 item 3  legal proceedings

 item 7   managements discussion and  analysis of  financial condition  and
 results of operations

 the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected financial  data and  the  consolidated financial  statements  and
 related notes included elsewhere in this report


 overview

 we provide  integrated computer  systems for  inhouse and  outsourced  data
 processing to commercial  banks with under  100 billion  in total  assets
 credit unions  and  other  financial institutions  we  have  developed  and
 acquired banking application software systems that we market together  with
 compatible computer  hardware  to  financial  institutions  throughout  the
 united states we also perform data conversion and software installation for
 the  implementation  of   our  systems  and   provide  continuing   customer
 maintenance and support services  after the systems  are installed for  our
 customers who prefer  not to  make an  upfront investment  in software  and
 hardware we  provide  our  full  range  of  products  and  services  on  an
 outsourced basis through our eight data centers and fourteen item processing
 centers located across the united states

 we derive revenues from three primary sources

     sales of software licenses and installation services

     support and services fees and

     hardware sales

 over the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from 1263 million
 in fiscal 1997  to 3455  million in  fiscal 2001  income from  continuing
 operations has grown from 185 million  in fiscal 1997 to 556 million  in
 fiscal 2001  this growth  has resulted  primarily from  internal  expansion
 supplemented by strategic acquisitions allowing us to develop new  products
 and expand the  number of  customers who use  our core  software systems  to
 approximately 2425 as of june 30 2001

 since july 1994 we have completed  15 strategic acquisitions ten of  these
 acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and
 our consolidated financial statements include  the results of operations  of
 the acquired companies from the dates of their respective acquisitions  the
 remaining  five  acquisitions were accounted  for as  poolingsofinterests
 the comparisons  set forth  below reflect  the  fact that  the  consolidated
 financial statements for fiscal  years 2000 and 1999  have been restated  to
 include all acquisitions accounted for  as poolingsofinterests as if  each
 had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period reported

 software  sales  and   installation  revenue  includes   the  licensing   of
 application software systems  and the conversion  and installation  services
 contracted with us  by the customer   we license  our proprietary  software
 products under  standard  license  agreements which  typically  provide  the
 customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on
 a single  computer and  for a  single  financial institution  location  upon
 payment of  the license  fee generally  25  to 50  of license  fees  are
 payable upon execution of the license agreement with additional payments due
 upon either  delivery  of the  software  or  the installation  of  the  last
 application module  we  recognize 100  of  software license  revenue  upon
 delivery of  the  software  and  documentation  we  recognize  installation
 services each month as services are performed under hourly contracts and  at
 the completion of the installations under fixed fee contracts

 support and services fees are generated from ongoing services to assist  the
 customer in operating the systems and to modify and update the software  and
 from providing outsourced data  processing services revenues from  software
 support are  generated  pursuant to  annual  agreements and  are  recognized
 ratably over the life of the agreements outsourcing services are  performed
 through data centers revenues from  outsourced data processing are  derived
 from monthly usage fees typically under fiveyear service contracts with our
 customers we recognize  the revenues under  these outsourcing contracts  as
 services are performed

 cost of  services represents  direct costs  associated with  conversion  and
 installation efforts  ongoing    support for  our  inhouse  customers  and
 operation  of  our  data  centers  providing  services  for  our  outsourced
 customers these costs are recognized as they are incurred

 we  have  entered   into  remarketing  agreements   with  several   hardware
 manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services  to
 our customers along with  our inhouse banking  software systems   revenues
 from hardware sales are recognized when the manufacturers ship the hardware
 cost of hardware consists  of the direct costs  of purchasing the  equipment
 from the manufacturers these costs are  recognized at the same time as  the
 related revenue

 the company has two business segments bank systems and services and  credit
 union systems and  services  the  respective segments  include all  related
 software installation support and service  and hardware sales along  with
 related cost of services and hardware


 results of operations


 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000

 revenue  revenues increased  by 53 from 2253  million in fiscal 2000  to
 3455 million in fiscal 2001 software licensing and installation increased
 76 support and service revenues increased 38 and hardware sales increased
 57 compared to  fiscal 2000  the significant  increase is  due to  organic
 growth in comparison to the prior  year which was directly impacted by  the
 y2k slowdown and  a full year  impact on the  current year of  acquisitions
 made during fiscal 2000

 nonhardware revenues which includes  software licensing and  installation
 support  and  services  revenues   increased   52  to  2354  million  and
 accounted for 68 of this years revenues compared to 1552 million or 69
 of revenues for fiscal 2000

 hardware sales increased  57 to 1101  million and accounted  for 32  of
 revenues compared to  701 million or  31 of total  revenues for  fiscal
 2000  the increase in hardware sales was in line with the increase in  non
 hardware revenues for the same reasons

 cost of sales  cost  of sales increased 52  from 1272 million in  fiscal
 2000 to  1938  million in  fiscal  2001 compared  to  a 53  increase  in
 revenues  cost of hardware increased  48 compared with the 57 increase in
 hardware revenue   cost  of  services increased  55  compared to  the  52
 increase in  nonhardware revenues   this  is primarily  due to  operations
 acquired in the prior year  whose gross margins are  less than the rest  of
 the companys

 gross profit  gross profit increased 55 from 981 million in fiscal  2000
 to 1516 million in fiscal 2001  gross margin on nonhardware revenue  was
 50 compared to 51 last  year  gross margin  on hardware revenues was  31
 compared to 27  last year  primarily due  to sales  mix   the total  gross
 margin percentage for fiscal 2001 was 44 up slightly from fiscal 2000

 operating expenses    operating  expenses increased 40 from 471  million
 in fiscal  2000 to  658 million  in fiscal  2001   selling and  marketing
 expenses increased 46 research and  development increased 36 and  general
 and administrative expenses  increased 36  during   fiscal 2001  operating
 expenses increased  due to  higher commissions  related to  stronger  sales
 continued development and refinement of new and existing products and higher
 overhead related to prior acquisitions and overall growth

 other income expense    other income increased  from 755000  in  fiscal
 2000 to 12 million in fiscal 2001  the primary change is due to the  debt
 related to acquisitions  in fiscal 2000  being retired in  august 2000  with
 operating cash flows and the proceeds from the secondary offering in  august
 2000  interest  income increased  5 million  interest expense  decreased
 10 million and other decreased by  11 million due to  a gain on sale  of
 stock investment in the prior year

 provision for  income taxes    the provision  for  income taxes  was  312
 million or 36 of income from continuing operations before income taxes  in
 fiscal 2001 compared with 174 million  or 34 of income from  continuing
 operations before income taxes in fiscal 2000   the rate increase is due to
 the federal  and state  tax benefits  realized in  the prior  year from  the
 disposition of specific assets

 income from  continuing  operations    income  from  continuing  operations
 increased 62 from 344 million or  40 per diluted share in fiscal  2000
 to 556 million or 61 per diluted share in fiscal 2001

 discontinued operations   none  this year  compared to  332000 loss  from

 three months ended september 30 1999


 fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

 revenue   revenues increased by 16  from 1935 million in fiscal 1999  to
 2253 million in fiscal 2000 software licensing and installation increased
 22 support and service revenues increased 37 and hardware sales decreased
 7 compared to fiscal 1999  the changes in revenues from the prior year are
 a direct result  of the y2k  induced slow down  of system  sales during  the
 first half of fiscal 2000 the  significant increase  in posty2k demand for
 our products and  services and the  contribution of 211  million from  our
 open systems group osg acquisition in september 1999

 cost of sales   cost of sales  increased 19 from 1072 million in  fiscal
 1999 to  1272  million in  fiscal  2000 compared  to  a 16  increase  in
 revenues  cost of  hardware decreased 7 compared  with the 7 decrease  in
 hardware revenue   cost  of  services increased  45  compared to  the  31
 increase in nonhardware  revenues with  the most  significant increase  in
 costs resulting from the addition of osg

 gross profit   gross profit increased 14 from 863 million in fiscal 1999
 to 981 million in fiscal 2000 the gross margin percentage for fiscal 2000
 was 44 down from 45 during 1999 primarily because of changes in sales
 mix due to the impact of y2k

 operating expenses   operating expenses increased 29 from 366 million in
 fiscal 1999 to 471 million in fiscal 2000  selling and marketing expenses
 increased 36  research  and  development increased  55  and  general  and
 administrative expenses increased  16 during fiscal  2000  these  expenses
 grew more rapidly than revenue because  despite the impact of y2k  referred
 to above  we continued  operations and  staffing levels  necessary to  meet
 anticipated demand in the second half of fiscal 2000  the most  significant
 increase was in  research and development  a large portion  of which was  a
 result of the continued development of our internetrelated products

 other income expense    other income decreased  60 from 19 million  in
 fiscal 1999 to 755000 in fiscal  2000  the 11  million gain on sale  in
 september 1999 of a stock investment acquired in the peerless  acquisition
 in large part offset  the increase in interest  expense of 18 million  and
 the decrease in interest income of 756000 from cash investments in  fiscal
 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

 provision for  income taxes     the provision  for income  taxes was  174
 million or 34 of income from continuing operations before income taxes  in
 fiscal 2000 compared with 189 million  or 37 of income from  continuing
 operations before  income  taxes  in  fiscal  1999  this  decrease  in  the
 effective tax rate reflects benefits derived  from our tax planning  efforts
 to reduce state income taxes

 income from  continuing  operations     income from  continuing  operations
 increased 5 from 327 million or 39 per diluted share in fiscal 1999 to
 344 million or 40 per diluted share in fiscal 2000

 discontinued operations    we incurred  a 332000  loss from  discontinued
 operations in fiscal  2000 all of  which was realized  in the three  months
 ended september  30  1999   this  was 426000  less  than the  loss  from
 discontinued operations for fiscal 1999

 million in fiscal 2000 to 1381 million or 44 increase for the year ended
